We were all on the same page and everyone knew what BizStream was about. But as we grew and as we brought on more people, we slowly began to realize that maybe our vision wasn\u2019t being seen by everyone. The \u201CBizStream way\u201D was becoming blurred. As much as we hate to have a bunch of rules in place and things in writing, it became pretty clear that if we wanted to keep our unique culture and [kick-ass] work ethic, that we needed to lay it out in black and white for our people. Because, as much as we aren\u2019t about a bunch of rules, we are about complete transparency, setting our team up for success, and keeping BizStream an awesome place to work for hard-working people. As our team continues to grow we want to make sure we\u2019re bringing people on that are a great fit for BizStream, and on the flip side, that they can somewhat easily determine if this is a place that they want to be a part of before they even walk into an interview with us."}

We started by asking ourselves questions like, \u201CWhy do we get up in the morning? Why does BizStream exist?\u201D And after a fairly quick discussion, most of us came to a very similar reason. We finalized our Core Focus as:"}

We love technology, we love building cool things and we also know that the majority of our waking hours are spent at work. So, if we are spending that much time at work, we better enjoy it. We believe it is our team that makes us WANT to come to work versus the majority of the workforce, that DREADS coming to work. I\u2019ve said it in the past, \u201CI want to go to work every day and write code with my friends\u201D, that\u2019s why I started BizStream, and it\u2019s really important to me that we keep it that way. The last part of our core focus, \u201Chave a positive impact on others\u201D is because Brian\u00A0(co-founder) and I want to work with people that are not just here for themselves. It\u2019s a big world out there and we strongly feel one of the best things we can do as a human is to positively impact as many other people as possible. It also means doing as much in the community as we can. This is why many of us at BizStream are coaches, scoutmasters, youth group leaders, robotics team advisers, BizStream Academy mentors and so much more. Many of us especially love working with youth, education, and technology."}

One of the common phrases you\u2019ll hear around here is \u201CWe are experts in things we\u2019ve never done before\u201D. Of course, that only refers to the world of programming. I wouldn\u2019t ask our team members to land a 747 or do brain surgery. But when it comes to programming and complex integrations, \u201Cwe got this\u201D.

We aren\u2019t really into making yet another simple, static brochure site that has nothing complicated going on in it. However, if it is e-commerce, multilingual, multi-site, tapping into multiple 3rd-party APIs, pulling data from an ERP, CRM or 10 other systems \u2026 our ears are perking up, and we are already thinking about possible solutions to propose to the client.

We don\u2019t want anyone getting left behind. It\u2019s not just at the employee level either. Whatever it takes means the owners take care of our employees, their families, and our communities. Leadership will do whatever it takes to ensure our team members have what they need to succeed \u2013 extra help on a project, a last-minute mental health day, maybe even an advanced HSA payment when unexpected medical issues arise. When we do whatever it takes for each other, we are a stronger unit. Whatever it takes also means that our clients are well taken care of. To us, it\u2019s not always about the bottom line. Yes, we are a business; we need to make money, but giving a little extra here and there is ok too, especially if it is impactful to our client."}

Actually, if our managers see one of their team members consistently putting in more than 45 hours a week, they will meet with that team member to understand why and make a plan to them get back to their standard 40-42 hours. We make it a point to monitor hours for many reasons \u2013 One, we want our people to spend their non-working time with their friends and family and hobbies. Two, we want to avoid burnout and unneeded stress."}

We don\u2019t want our people spending 60 hours at work where 20 of those hours are unproductive. At BizStream, we take on challenging projects with tight timelines. So when our team is on the clock, it is GO TIME. The owners and the leadership team live and breathe a strong work ethic, and we expect the same from the rest of our team. We like to get stuff done. When our whole team is working hard, we are unstoppable and can accomplish anything, including having a fun environment. Our play hard time is just as important to us (a quick foosball match, organized social hours, office parties \u0026 outings, etc.) because it allows our team to decompress and get to know each other on a personal level. I believe our team works better when they are confident that everyone is pulling their weight; It also makes our playtime that much sweeter \u2013 because the team knows we all crushed it to make our fun times happen. Because of this, I believe working hard and playing hard go hand in hand."}

But with all of us following the core values, we know we are a team, and we truly care about each person on our team and the work that we deliver to our clients. Having core values allows us to take a step back and ask ourselves if what we\u2019re doing is in line with the BizStream Core Values and Focus. Essentially, for the greater good of the company. If it\u2019s not, we need to re-think what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. We can have very strong yet healthy discussions and still come up with great solutions because we are not afraid to say our viewpoint or disagree with someone else\u2019s.

There are plenty of jobs out there where you can do that, just not here. Part of BizStream\u2019s DNA is to do Whatever it Takes, Work Hard and Play Hard, Be a Team and Care. So, that means, after-hours or on the weekends, we might be hanging out together doing something cool, or working out together at the local CrossFit gym, helping someone out at their house, or occasionally staying a little late at the office to get something done. You\u2019ll also find a lot of us doing community work or volunteering to teach kids how to code. But we\u2019re doing that because we care and because \u2026 we give a shit.If you follow our social media, you\u2019ve probably noticed that we have a ton of fun. Because we DO Play Hard here. From parties (while most other companies are working) to having mini coolers all throughout the office stocked with microbrews, to team backpacking trips, and a ton more. We have a lot of fun. But the flip side to that is when we are working, we work really hard. If you are the type that likes to go to work, and kind of pretend like you are working, do half social media, news, online shopping, chatting, whatever other non-working stuff and half kinda pretend you are working \u2026 you are going to stand out like a sore thumb and BizStream is going to be very uncomfortable for you."}

However, working for a digital agency like BizStream has provided me with numerous advantages and opportunities to grow as a developer. Since starting as an intern in October 2022, I have progressed to a junior developer and learned so much from working alongside a diverse team of experts. In this blog post, I\u2019ll explore some of the many benefits of working for a digital agency such as BizStream and how it can help new developers like myself gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals."}
{"id":"p161_l2","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"One major advantage of working for a digital agency like BizStream is the opportunity to work with a diverse team of experts with a wide range of skill sets. This allows new developers to expand their knowledge and experience in different areas of digital development, including branding, web design, web development, digital strategy, consulting, CMS platform selection, and more. No two projects are the same, and it is incredibly convenient for new developers to have access to a variety of experts within the agency to ask questions and get quick, detailed answers. Having immediate access decreases the amount of time spent muddling through projects and ensures that the work being produced is of high quality. It also helps to streamline communication with clients, as there is no need to send a chain of emails back and forth between the agency and an outside team. As a result, the agency can respond to clients quickly and efficiently, delivering projects on time and within budget."}
{"id":"p161_l3","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"Furthermore, working with an agency allows new developers to experience a coordinated approach to online strategy. At BizStream, for example, the entire team assigned to each project is privy to the consulting, design, and spin-up processes. By doing this, expectations are shared early on, and there is minimal room for deviation. This approach ensures that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goals and is aware of the different pieces that make up the whole. It also helps new developers gain a deeper understanding of the impact of their work and the importance of collaboration across different teams."}
{"id":"p161_l4","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"In addition to the above, digital agency can provide new developers with the opportunity to work on a variety of projects for different clients. As a result, junior developers are able to build a diverse portfolio and develop their skills in different areas. Working on various projects also allows new developers to learn from experienced developers who can provide mentorship and guidance. This can help new developers improve their skills and develop professionally. Since joining the team at BizStream, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work on a range of diverse projects, including developing a website for a non-profit hospital system, updating an ecommerce site, building a water sample data reporting site, and will soon be working on an agricultural product and education site. As a junior developer, I am overjoyed by my expanding portfolio and know it is something that I would have struggled to achieve on my own and on this scale."}
{"id":"p161_l5","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"Another benefit of working for an agency is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. At BizStream, for example, new developers are constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, such as headless CMS, serverless architecture, and AI/machine learning. With that being the case, we are able to stay ahead of the curve and develop skills that are in high demand in the industry."}
{"id":"p161_l6","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"Working for digital agency can also provide new developers with opportunities for career growth and advancement.

They can also move into different areas of the agency, such as project management or business development, if they have an interest in those areas."}

Here\u2019s my take: If performance is the #1 priority, we need to think beyond JavaScript metaframe-works and focus on the architecture. First and foremost, we need server-side rendering, and there\u2019s hardly a more performant stack than C# ASP.NET Core with all of its caching capabilities and optimized memory management. If you\u2019re using C# and opting into cloud hosting, you\u2019re looking at Elastic Beanstalk or AWS App Services. Client-side, we want something that is lightweight to reduce bloat. If you can, go with vanilla JavaScript (with TypeScript for development, of course). At each step, the priority is reduction, caching, and minimizing client-server interactions."}

Scaling out is definitely a quicker fix, especially if you\u2019re hosting in Azure or AWS, but it could burn a hole in your pocket if you\u2019re not careful. Optimizing data caching is the fix, as opposed to a band aid solution like scaling out."}

My recommendation: Consider your user base. For a consumer app, prioritize a smooth user experience by implementing a simple OAuth2 flow, with MFA as an optional feature for those who want extra security. This approach minimizes friction, making it easy for users to sign in while still offering additional protection when needed. In contrast, for enterprise apps handling sensitive data, mandatory MFA is essential despite adding complexity, as the higher stakes require robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access."}

In order to grab the correct web page item, we need to limit the results by the WebPageItemId. We can do this by getting the page context using the IWebPageDataContextRetriever. The code below shows how we can build the query to retrieve the page."}

By manually retrieving the page data and initializing the context, you can get your custom-routed pages working seamlessly with the page builder.

{"id":"p185_l1","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"With the release of Xperience by Kentico, the platform has experienced significant transformations aimed at enhancing flexibility and performance. This version introduces a range of new features and improvements, marking a clear shift from previous iterations. An aspect of these changes is the updates to the API, which now adopts a modular and service-oriented architecture. These updates are designed to provide developers with more efficient and powerful tools for managing content and integrating with third-party systems. The new API structure emphasizes flexibility, allowing for more precise queries and streamlined data operations, which improves developer experience and application performance."}
{"id":"p185_l2","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"The first notable change to Xperience by Kentico\u2019s API from previous iterations is the removal of the concept of a TreeNode. Previously, TreeNode was central to representing and managing the hierarchical structure of pages within the CMS, allowing developers to manipulate page data directly through a tree-like structure. The removal of this concept marks a significant shift in how content hierarchies are handled within the platform. The tree structure, while powerful, imposed certain limitations on scalability and performance, particularly as websites grew in complexity and size. By moving away from a tree-based model, Kentico aims to provide a more flexible and modular approach to content management that can better support modern web development needs."}
{"id":"p185_l3","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"In place of TreeNode, Xperience by Kentico now utilizes new APIs that separate content retrieval into two sets of objects: one for querying web page-specific content from a given channel called IWebPageFieldsSource and one for querying re-usable content from the new Content Hub called IContentItemFieldsSource. These interfaces make it easier and more efficient to retrieve and manage content."}
{"id":"p185_l4","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"The ContentItemQueryBuilder class is at the core of this new querying system. It allows developers to build detailed queries tailored to specific content types and retrieval needs. Paired with the IContentQueryExecutor, the API supports complex filtering, sorting, and data manipulation, making it easier to develop dynamic, content-rich applications. This new API structure enhances the developer experience by improving the ability to handle complex content scenarios with ease.Shown below is a depiction of the overall structure of a content item query."}

{"id":"p185_l6","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"To start, you can build a simple query that retrieves all items of a specific content type. This is useful when you need to fetch a complete list of content items for display or processing."}
{"id":"p185_l7","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"Then, you can apply subquery configuration and global parameters like sorting to the content items being queried."}

{"id":"p185_l9","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"After your query is built, it is time to execute the query.

{"id":"p185_l11","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"Alternatively, you can pass in a custom model binder to handle the mapping.

{"id":"p185_l12","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"When you need to retrieve both web page-related data and content item-related data, the Xperience by Kentico API provides methods to execute these queries and map the results to your models. This is useful for scenarios where you want to handle data that includes both the content of a web page and additional metadata or settings associated with it."}

{"id":"p185_l14","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"Alternatively, the GetWebPageResult method allows you to pass in a custom model binder.

{"id":"p185_l15","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"By using these methods, you can efficiently execute queries and handle the results, whether you\u2019re working with content item data, web page data, or both. The choice between using GetMappedResult/GetMappedWebPageResult and their counterparts with a model binder depends on your need for standard or custom mapping logic."}
{"id":"p185_l16","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"The updates to Xperience by Kentico represent a significant evolution in how developers can query and structure content within the platform.

{"id":"p205_l2","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that\u2019s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU\u2019s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing."}
{"id":"p205_l3","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"After GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy."}
{"id":"p205_l4","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"With a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That\u2019s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don\u2019t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That\u2019s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later."}
{"id":"p205_l5","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"At BizStream, we\u2019ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it\u2019s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be clich\u00E9, but it\u2019s true \u2014 we work hard and we play hard."}
{"id":"p205_l6","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"I\u2019ve found that if you\u2019re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, and I\u2019m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don\u2019t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don\u2019t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren\u2019t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people."}
{"id":"p205_l7","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"The reason BizStream\u2019s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn\u2019t want to work at a typical job. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let\u2019s make it something we want to do."}
{"id":"p205_l8","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"This mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We\u2019ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible)."}

I\u2019ve done a lot of home automation, and I\u2019m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too."}

Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love.

These projects are designed to bring significant ROI to the greater BizStream team. For a developer internship, it could be an application that automates building out SOWs, a better tracking system for our daily goals, or even a potential product we plan to ship. For marketing, maybe it\u2019s a re-design of one of our existing websites or updating content in our space to bring it up to brand. Regardless, it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity."}

And when I say it\u2019s been a pleasure to work with, I really mean it. The sheer speed of everything (and not just the administration application), combined with an excellent developer experience and an active, growing community surrounding it, makes Xperience by Kentico a breath of fresh air for content administrators and developers alike."}
{"id":"p233_l2","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"One of the first things you\u2019re likely to notice when working with a site that\u2019s been built using Xperience, is the incredible speed at which you can navigate and manage your site(s). If you\u2019ve worked with Kentico sites in the past, I can assure you that Xperience\u2019s administration interface is a massive leap forward."}
{"id":"p233_l3","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"Outside of using the administrative application itself, there\u2019s still so much more to love. One of the great aspects of this new platform is the rate at which new features are being added to the product. There\u2019s monthly \u201Crefreshes\u201D, as they\u2019re called, and each one is packed full of new features for both content administrators and developers."}
{"id":"p233_l4","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"Speaking of developers, one of the biggest speed improvements is found in the act of building and running the site. Gone are the days of waiting 30\u002B seconds for a heavy CMS administration site to spin up and initialize in order to validate that your changes are working as expected. Since Xperience has been built using .NET Core and React, it takes only a few seconds to go from dotnet watch to interacting with your site."}
{"id":"p233_l5","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"Sticking with the topic of developers, there\u2019s so many aspects of the new Xperience platform that give it an excellent developer experience."}
{"id":"p233_l6","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"One of the things I\u2019ve come to appreciate the most about Xperience is the plethora of things that can be accomplished via the .NET CLI. From the usage of dotnet templates for spinning up a new site, to using the kentico-xperience-dbmanager for spinning up databases, and a handful of flags that can be used with dotnet run in order to update the database version and execute Kentico CI and CD commands. There\u2019s even CLI commands to generate code based on the content types, forms, reusable field schemas, and module classes that are built within the DXP to be used by your presentation site\u2019s code."}
{"id":"p233_l7","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"Due to all the application management that can be done from the CLI, it makes building, configuring, and extending the CI/CD configuration for your solution extremely easy and straightforward. Combine that with the fact that everything is based on .NET Core now, making it so the underlying build agent can be Linux, and you\u2019ve got yourself a recipe for incredibly fast builds and releases."}
{"id":"p233_l8","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"One of the powerful things we\u2019ve been able to implement on our projects (which is a bit of a copy of what\u2019s been done on the Kentico Community Portal site), which is the idea of spinning up a SQL Server instance, restoring a database backup, running Kentico CI Restore to get the database in sync with the latest changes, then running Kentico CD Store in order to serialize whatever files are needed on the destination machine in order to run the Kentico CD Restore command post-deployment to sync up any object or content changes that need to exist \uD83E\uDD2F. That may sound like a lot, and you might need to re-read that a few times to follow everything that\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s been a powerful way to generate the CD files as part of the build process, rather than needing developers to continuously commit those files to the repository, which will be changing for each deployment, and are more or less duplicates of many of the CI files that are already present in the repository."}
{"id":"p233_l9","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"You may be wondering though, \u201Cdoesn\u2019t all that drastically slow down your CI/CD builds?\u201D. If we were still using Windows build agents, then yes, because I was seeing build times in the 10-12 minute range when including these database and serialization steps. But when building on Linux agents, it\u2019s able to build the solution, run all the steps above, and publish the results as an artifact in just 2.5 minutes on average. That\u2019s about a 2x-3x speed improvement over just building .NET Framework solutions back in the day."}
{"id":"p233_l10","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"The points above obviously already hit on some of the benefits of being on modern tech like .NET Core, but the conversation doesn\u2019t end there. If you\u2019ve worked on a Kentico site recently, you likely know that whenever you needed to make any customizations to the administration interface, you were required to do so by building out your UI and backend logic using Web Forms. Compare that to Xperience, where your customizations are all built using React, a modern and widely adopted Javascript framework."}
{"id":"p233_l11","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"One of the biggest benefits of being on a modern tech stack like .NET Core and React, is the fact that more developers are familiar with these technologies and will be better equipped to build and maintain sites that are built using them. I would also wager that it\u2019s easier to find new developers with React experience than it is finding ones with Web Forms experience, so easier hiring can also be a great potential downstream effect of moving to a platform like Xperience."}
{"id":"p233_l12","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"If you\u2019ve ever worked on a brand new platform that didn\u2019t have great documentation or had a small number of people building with it, you know the pain of feeling stuck with nowhere to go. Thankfully, the Xperience community and platform are mature enough to provide you with everything you need to build out excellent digital experiences without the dreadful feeling of being alone."}
{"id":"p233_l13","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"The first place you can turn to would be the extremely thorough documentation about the platform. Nearly everything you would need to know about using the administration interface as a content administrator, or building out websites or email channels and all the components that go along with each, can be found within the Xperience Documentation site."}
{"id":"p233_l14","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"If you happen to strike out with finding what you need in the documentation, the next best place to look would be the Kentico Community Portal. This is a great resource due to the information that can be found within the blog posts, as well as the Q\u0026A section of the site. If you can\u2019t find an existing question that matches whatever it is you\u2019re running into, you can create an account and ask away!"}

{"id":"p249_l2","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"On the flip side, we see a lot of great features that are often underutilized in Kentico. Some of these features might not be useful for every company, but many would do well to add them to their marketing arsenal. We\u2019re going to be looking at three:"}
{"id":"p249_l3","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"Using these tools, marketing teams can greatly expand their understanding of their customers and create more targeted and relevant content."}
{"id":"p249_l4","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"A/B testing is when you display two types of marketing content to different audiences to see which performs better. For instance, a website may be performing an A/B test for the image used on a specific featured item."}
{"id":"p249_l5","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"A/B testing is one of the most under-utilized features in marketing. Instead of spending time arguing internally whether a page should feature an image or a video, creating an A/B test and seeing which one performs the best can give you fast and accurate results. You may find one beats the other by a landslide, or you may find there is hardly any difference at all."}
{"id":"p249_l6","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"First, A/B testing needs to be set up in order for content admins to be able to use it. Once enabled, content admins need only to go to the page they would like to create an A/B test on and select \u201CCreate an A/B Test\u201D. This will open a modal that will then allow the content admin to configure, start, and evaluate the A/B test."}
{"id":"p249_l7","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"First, just as we all learned in science class, you can only test one variable at a time. If you create an A/B test with several different elements between the two pages, you won\u2019t know why one performed better than the other. As you can see in the image above, the only difference between the two tests is that one has an image, and one has a video."}
{"id":"p249_l8","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"A/B tests should have a limited duration. Get the answers you are looking for, then choose the better performing test. If you\u2019ve had 5000 site visitors since beginning the test and 70% chose option A and 30% chose option B, that is plenty of data to know which to go with. Keeping an A/B test running for too long can hurt SEO."}
{"id":"p249_l9","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"While you should only have one primary difference between any given A/B test, you can (and should) have multiple A/B tests going at any given time. Once you know which option is performing better or if there is no significant difference, iterate on the last test to continue improving your content. This will allow you to continue learning from your customers about what content they like and don\u2019t like."}
{"id":"p249_l10","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"For many companies and organizations, they don\u2019t have a single type of audience coming to their website. Different audience types viewing your site may not overlap in user behavior, interests, attributes, and characteristics. As a marketer, you want to show content relevant to the customers viewing the site, not content that is irrelevant to them."}
{"id":"p249_l11","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"This creates a challenge for marketers since it seems like your choices are either to show multiple types of content (which means showing things to users who don\u2019t want to see it) or only show generic content that could be for everyone but that isn\u2019t as helpful for anyone."}
{"id":"p249_l12","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"This is where personas prove their worth.

{"id":"p249_l13","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"For example, let\u2019s say you have a company that sells running shoes. One audience type is for someone who is simply looking for a new pair of shoes. Let\u2019s call that audience \u201CNew Buyers\u201D. Another known customer is someone who is looking for races that you have listed on the site. This audience is called \u201CRacers\u201D. Finally, there are some customers that are raving fans of your brand and often buy merchandise and specialized shoes that have a limited amount made. Let\u2019s call this audience \u201CLoyalty Customers\u201D."}
{"id":"p249_l14","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"In Kentico, content admins can define these personas by assigning \u201Cpoints\u201D to a user who matches certain attributes and behaviors. Personas are then set at a threshold and once a user meets that threshold, they are added to that group. For example, let\u2019s set up the following point values and thresholds for our three user groups."}
{"id":"p249_l15","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"This user would receive 146 points for being a new buyer and 109 points for the Racer\u2019s audience. Since the user is further past the New Buyer threshold as a percentage, Kentico will place them in that persona."}
{"id":"p249_l16","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"Content admins can then use this knowledge to create specific content to that persona type through their site, email blasts, and campaigns, giving users content that is specific and relevant to them."}

{"id":"p249_l18","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"Campaigns can be used to promote a new product or simply to attract more users to your site.

You may be saying to yourself, GA4 is not an under-utilized feature, every site has GA4 these days. Maybe, but how well do your marketers actually use it? Do they know what they are tracking? More importantly, do they know what the data they are tracking means? More importantly still, are they listening to what the data is telling them? If you answered no to any of these questions, I would argue that you are not using Google Analytics to its full potential."}

If the site is eventually going to be maintained by the client, their environment has a heavy reliance on Microsoft IIS, and they mostly have C# developers, then building the site with ASP.NET should be considered before writing the site entirely in one of the meta-frameworks mentioned above. But, if they know JavaScript and/or Node development well, then writing with mostly JavaScript is probably the best.Another thing to think about is the project budget and the learning curve of using a larger framework or meta-framework. If no one has experience with Next.js and the budget is tight, it might pose too high of a risk to implement the site with it. On the other hand, if the budget allows the investment, frameworks, and meta-frameworks can be a joy to learn and work in."}

Now, here\u2019s the thing\u2014Zero Trust means many things to many different people/vendors in the tech realm. Ask five vendors about their Zero Trust product, and you\u2019re likely to get five different answers, a toolkit that resembles a tech wizard\u2019s dream, and likely a price tag to fit that dream. So, let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and dig into Zero Trust\u2014at least, what it means to BizStream and what it could mean for you and your company."}

I choose to think of it as a security framework. Once I have that, I can find the tool to match my needs."}
{"id":"p273_l4","pageTitle":"ZTTNBTOJTLB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/zero-trust-the-next-big-thing-or-just-the-latest-buzzword/","text":"When I dove into this Zero Trust rabbit hole and quickly realized that everyone had their own spin on it, I decided I needed to carve out what I was aiming for. Here\u2019s the rough sketch I came up with:We need a better way to grant secure access to our legacy network and cloud resources from devices we may not own and networks we may not control.Man, that is like a mission statement or something. I kid, but this really helped as I talked to vendors to find the right tool/software."}
{"id":"p273_l5","pageTitle":"ZTTNBTOJTLB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/zero-trust-the-next-big-thing-or-just-the-latest-buzzword/","text":"So, after researching and talking with vendors, I came up with the following \u201Cquestion\u201D to build my Zero Trust framework upon. Should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource? It might not sound revolutionary if you\u2019ve been around tech for a while, but it helped me frame what I was looking for, more context around that control."}

Picture this\u2014when our team strolls into the office, the Wi-Fi network is just another network. It\u2019s got zero connection or context to our core. We\u2019re using a next-gen Zero Trust application that lets us answer that crucial question: should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource?"}

This helps the company leadership, and me understand the risk we are introducing with our access. Maybe the data is highly sensitive, and I only want to grant that access with additional security measures in place, like forcing an MFA challenge. The added bonus is that the framework is now applied to all of my networks. We can layer on extra security to legacy networks that lack MFA or need additional security with very little effort. We can route traffic after security challenges have been met without complicated firewall rules."}

The nth-child syntax now provides a keyword \u201Cof\u201D, which can be used like so: :nth-child(2 of .my-class). This will first find all the elements with .my-class and select the second occurrence of that class. As opposed to .my-class:nth-child(2), which would select an element with .my-class that is also the second child. As a developer of websites using content management systems, this can be very useful. One use case of this feature is when you need to target the second occurrence of a class that is on a widget/component. However, you don\u2019t know where or how the content editor is going to nest this widget within other content. Now you can easily target the second occurrence of that class, with the nth-of syntax."}

With text-wrap: balance, the browser will calculate the best way to wrap text in an element so that all the lines are \u201Cbalanced\u201D. In other words, each line of text will have similar lengths. Right now, text-wrap: balance only works with up to 4 lines of text, so it is best reserved for headings or content that you are confident won\u2019t span more than 4 lines at any given viewport width. In addition, text-wrap: balance is not yet supported by Firefox or Safari, but this is a progressive enhancement. So if a user is on either of those browsers, it will just appear as if that property wasn\u2019t used. The example below shows an example of text-wrap: balance in action.

This allows you to hide/show content or change the layout based on the size of a parent element. In order to use container queries, you must specify an element as a container using the container-type property. The container-type property has three possible values, size, inline-size, and normal. Refer to the MDN docs for an explanation of each value. Once a containment context has been created, you can use the @container\u00A0at-rule to create a container query. Think of the container query just like media queries, but instead of basing the query on the viewport size, it\u2019s based on the specified containment element\u2019s size.

{"id":"p285_l10","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"When we first assessed the engineering ladders approach, we felt like it covered most aspects of what we look for in developers but needed just a few minor tweaks to be tailored to how BizStream runs and operates."}
{"id":"p285_l11","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"We decided to update the System axis to better match the type of work we do at BizStream, which mainly involved changing some of the verbiage of the levels to be more \u201Cproject\u201D focused and less \u201Csystem\u201D focused."}
{"id":"p285_l12","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"For the Process axis, we made a similar update to what we did with the System axis, in which we modified the verbiage to also encompass development standards. Although one could easily argue that development standards are a subset of processes, we felt it was beneficial to explicitly call them out so developers didn\u2019t just think about standard processes like code reviews and branching strategies."}
{"id":"p285_l13","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"As an agency, one of the main activities our developers\u2019 experience is interacting and interfacing with clients. Since this is such a large aspect of the developer role at BizStream, we felt it was necessary to create a new axis that allowed us to measure client involvement."}
{"id":"p285_l14","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"As we\u2019ll discuss in the data collection section below, we wanted to make sure we had some real-world examples of what it might look like for a developer to be at a given level in each axis, so we went through and added some \u201Ctrue to BizStream\u201D examples under each level within each axis. This was done to try and remove as much ambiguity as possible when reviewing the different levels in each axis."}
{"id":"p285_l15","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"As referenced above, the original framework has predefined developer levels (D1 through D7), depending on where a developer stands across all the different axes. Although we believe this to be better than the standard Junior, Mid-level, and Senior levels, we still didn\u2019t like the idea of having explicit titles for our developers. One of the main reasons for this decision is down to the variability that will exist for each individual developer. We feel it\u2019s much better to assess the area of a developer\u2019s chart to determine overall aptitude rather than trying to shoehorn them into predefined levels."}
{"id":"p285_l16","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"One of the main benefits of this framework, combined with the changes we made to fit our specific needs, enabled us to easily gather all the data we needed by conducting a self/peer review process. This process involved every developer at BizStream filling out a form that allowed them to review themselves and decide which level within each axis they felt they were currently at. They would then fill out this form for every other developer on their team so we would have their assessment of all the other developers on their team. We also added an extra data point for each developer by allowing their manager to provide their input in the same way since their manager would likely have some additional insights that their peers might not.We then took all these data points and used the median values from all responses for an individual to determine where they stand within a given axis. We found this worked better than taking an average since it would give us an explicit value rather than a decimal value that needed to be rounded up or down, which we found caused results to be skewed up or down depending on what rounding approach we took.In addition to using the median to determine the outcome for a given axis, we also looked at the standard deviation of the responses to look for any inconsistencies in the review process. This helped us to better understand where additional examples or clarifications needed to be implemented so we could ensure our data was as accurate as possible (which isn\u2019t the easiest when there\u2019s lots of subjectivity involved). The standard deviation also helped us find places where additional discussions needed to occur. If we found instances where not many people were in agreement with where someone\u2019s skills were, we would pull the necessary people together to get a better understanding of where they should be assessed to ensure that the data we have is as accurate as possible."}
{"id":"p285_l17","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"Once we had all the data we needed and verified that it was as accurate as possible, we had to find the best way to share this information with the developers at BizStream. To accomplish this, we decided to build individual reports for every developer that contained the following information:"}
{"id":"p285_l18","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"Once all this information had been placed in a report, a meeting was scheduled to review the document with the developer. The finished report was also shared with the developer afterward for them to review and reference at any point in the future."}
{"id":"p285_l19","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"These reports are a great tool for developers and their managers to generate topics for discussion in one-on-ones and/or quarterlies. This gives developers and their managers the freedom to focus on whatever areas they believe matter the most."}
{"id":"p285_l20","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"Overall, this new approach to assessing developers is a step in the right direction. While this was only the first year that we\u2019ve attempted this approach, it was well received by the team as a great way to quantify where they stand as a developer at BizStream. We also received some great feedback that we\u2019re excited to implement the next time we run through this process. One of the most significant improvements is an addition to the reports outlining what steps must be taken in each axis to jump to the next level. This gives developers a clear path of actionable steps that can be taken to expand their areas of expertise and make a larger impact at BizStream."}

Although I acknowledged the developer\u2019s crucial role in resolving issues, I found myself resisting this notion. After all, problem-solving was a skill I enjoyed and believed I excelled at. Wasn\u2019t this a primary reason I was hired in the first place? Despite myself, this line of thinking led me to contemplate the nature of problems and how we go about identifying them."}

{"id":"p289_l6","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"As soon as the child was on shore, the young man looked up and, to his horror, saw two more children floating down river. Jumping back into the water, he grabbed one, then the other, pulling them ashore. A second later, another came struggling down the river.

Initially, rescuing the drowning children may appear to be the problem, but it is, in fact, a symptom of a more profound issue. While treating symptoms is essential in emergencies, consistently treating symptoms as the primary problem leads to trouble.For instance, if a client has a major bug that needs to be fixed that is caused by an aging technology stack, the best approach isn\u2019t to leave the bug while we figure out how to update the entire website. First, take care of the emergency, then take care of the underlying problem. However, we get into trouble when we continuously treat symptoms as If they were the underlying problem."}

{"id":"p289_l13","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"Asking questions to the client that helps enlighten where we are headed is neither prompting a solution nor asking what the problem is. In fact, as said before, we cannot determine the solution before knowing the problem, and we cannot know the problem without knowing where we are trying to get to."}
{"id":"p289_l14","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"To take the above story as an example again, if you asked the first two who arrived on the scene what they would like to see happen or what is an ideal state considering the situation, having better recuse equipment or being a stronger swimmer would not really address the problem. It would address the immediate symptoms of the problem and may prove to be very helpful. However, they do not solve the problem. The answer is to not have children floating down the river."}

Let\u2019s say a content admin has received frustrations from their website users that their homepage is too busy with links. The content admin comes to BizStream and requests we figure out a way for the homepage to be redesigned so that it looks less cluttered while still giving users the same amount of links to choose from so that users can still get to where they want to go."}

{"id":"p289_l17","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"Instead of asking for the problem, let\u2019s ask the question, what do we ideally want to happen? In this case, I would argue that ideally, the user would land on the homepage and could immediately find what they are looking for without showing anything superfluous. This may seem at first impossible. After all, how can we know what the user wants to see on page load? But if we start with the end in mind, it can help us determine what the real problem is: Users aren\u2019t able to quickly and conveniently get to where they want to go. This problem statement opens up many more potential solutions than \u201CThe homepage is too cluttered\u201D."}
{"id":"p289_l18","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"Stating the problem more openly and based on an ideal ending, we can only now determine what a potential solution would look like. For example, we may suggest adding a more robust search with search ahead capabilities. Or, we might suggest personalization, an often underutilized feature of Kentico that tracks users\u2019 preferences and places them as part of a group set by the content admins. Content could then be displayed based on a user\u2019s history on the site. We could even simply allow users to set their own \u201Cfavorited\u201D links, allowing them to always quickly get to where they want and remove the rest."}
{"id":"p289_l19","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"By beginning with an ideal end in mind, it allows us to help uncover the root of the problem, rather than symptoms of a larger problem. And while symptoms do sometimes need to be dealt with, a holistic and effective solution can only be designed after the problem has correctly been identified. So even though solutioning is a technological challenge that often should be approached by the developers, it turns out that problem-finding needs quite a bit of solutioning itself."}

{"id":"p305_l1","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"Last week, I attended an event by West Michigan Tech Talent, \u201CTech Trends with Keith Brophy.\u201D Keith is a futurist, Michigan Entrepreneur of the Year winner, and a long-time speaker on areas of digital transformation, including AI, Machine Learning, the Internet of Things, and Cyber Security."}
{"id":"p305_l2","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"As you can imagine, Keith\u2019s tech trends this year were focused on Artificial Technology (AI) and how it will change the world. This wasn\u2019t a big surprise, as AI, ChatGPT, Bard, and other technology have been filling headlines and social media feeds. What was a big surprise to me was his prediction that AI would change law enforcement."}
{"id":"p305_l3","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"Keith\u2019s take was that Police and AI would come together, providing guidance to officers in the field to help de-escalate situations. Body cameras utilizing AI technology to read facial expressions and body language with audio feeding in the ear of the officer providing prompts to guide the officer to a better outcome. This was a novel use of AI I hadn\u2019t heard of before \u2013 using tech already in use combined with AI to assist in situations where an officer may not have experience or a mental health professional can\u2019t be on site. That use was very interesting and got me thinking of how we could use AI in our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software."}
{"id":"p305_l4","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"AI has been tried in the court system and has had its share of problems. Bias has been a historical issue with AI\u2019s use in the justice system. In 2016, ProPublica highlighted this issue in an article titled \u201CMachine Bias,\u201D which scrutinized predictive policing software (AI) and revealed its racial bias against black individuals. ProPublica isn\u2019t alone in publishing information about AI use in the justice system; both The Atlantic and the UCLA Law Review published articles in 2019 highlighting the risks of perpetuating systemic biases, lack of transparency, and potential for erroneous decision-making when relying on AI algorithms."}
{"id":"p305_l5","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"We have explored using AI to predict recidivism or the success of a juvenile based on data stored in our system but have yet to put it to use based on the potential pitfalls outlined in the articles mentioned above. If prediction isn\u2019t a fair use of the technology, how else could we use AI to better the experience of our users and help benefit the youth they are working with?"}
{"id":"p305_l6","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"The truth is some of our YouthCenter users are using AI without even realizing they\u2019re using AI, with voice-to-text. With voice-to-text, they\u2019re dictating their case notes rather than typing them in. It\u2019s such a popular feature that I\u2019ve gotten hugs at conferences from caseworkers that utilize voice-to-text to enter their case notes. These case managers or probation officers (POs) are ecstatic because they\u2019re not bogged down by the administrative duties of case management, and it allows them the ability to spend additional time with the youth to coach them to better outcomes."}
{"id":"p305_l7","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"Voice-to-text is a great way to use AI to benefit the user without introducing bias. We\u2019re not alone in this technology use. Medical startups like Ambience and DeepScribe are transforming the way Doctors, nurses, and other practitioners interact with patients. No more typing data into an EMR; the technology listens, transcribes, and pulls important data from the conversation into electronic medical records (EMR)."}
{"id":"p305_l8","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"One of the unique features of YouthCenter is the Client Activity Log. The Activity Log is like a Facebook or Twitter timeline of any interaction or event with the youth. Events and entries are listed in chronological order, grouped by date, and ordered by time. The Activity log can be filtered by event or searched. While the Activity log provides a detailed listing of everything, it can be challenging to get a big-picture overview of what\u2019s happening with the youth at a glance."}
{"id":"p305_l9","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"Large language models, like GPT-3.5 (also known as ChatGPT), are excellent at summarizing complex information. AI-powered systems have the ability to quickly analyze and comprehend vast amounts of data. Data could include case notes, drug tests, program progress, and assessment scores. By processing this information, AI can generate concise and easy-to-understand summaries tailored to the needs of users, in our case, case workers, administrators, or POs. This not only saves time and resources for those involved in the justice system but also helps ensure that critical details are effectively communicated to all relevant parties. The use of AI in this context paves the way for more efficient and informed decision-making, ultimately improving the outcomes for young individuals in the juvenile justice system."}
{"id":"p305_l10","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"I listen to Spotify\u2019s \u201CDaily Drive\u201D on the way to the office almost every day. It\u2019s a short, customized summary of the day\u2019s news combined with the music I listen to. It\u2019s a great way to start the day. What if I could get a summary of my day sent to me? Imagine if you were a supervisor and could get a short summary of all the clients in your jurisdiction and listen to it on the way to the office. You\u2019re up to speed before you even walk in the door. Combining the AI summary capabilities with text-to-voice could make this possible."}
{"id":"p305_l11","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"What could make this even more interesting is using technology like Spotify has done with their AI DJ and voice-mimicking technology like Microsoft\u2019s VALL-E to build out a custom YouthCenter secure audio stream. Summaries could then be read in the voice and tone of the primary caseworker working with the specific youth. If you\u2019re a supervisor, you can get an update on the cases your team is working on in the voice of the case manager working with the youth case."}
{"id":"p305_l12","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"All these new use cases for AI in Juvenile Justice are great, but there are a few things we need to think about, and that\u2019s data security and privacy. Nobody should be copying and pasting any juvenile data into ChatGPT to get summaries. Lucky for us, we have our very own Microsoft Azure MVP on staff here who keeps us up to speed on this technology and issues like privacy."}
{"id":"p305_l13","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"Our YouthCenter Juvenile Case Management Software is hosted in the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud, which adds additional layers of security for our clients and us. The Azure OpenAI service is also available in the Government Cloud, allowing for the separation of juvenile data from other data sources through enterprise-grade security, role-based access control (RBAC), and private networks. Keeping juvenile data secure and away from others who shouldn\u2019t have access to it is a high priority. We take that security very seriously and will examine any AI technology and its access and sharing before we implement it."}
{"id":"p305_l14","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"We\u2019re happy to be a partner with Microsoft in AI technology. They\u2019ve developed a Responsible AI Standard that addresses many of the concerns with previous implementations of AI through their six principles for responsible AI: accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. Those 6 principles guide the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, and tests AI systems. Their commitment to inclusiveness, transparency, privacy, and security makes them an ideal partner for us in building AI technology into our juvenile case management system."}
{"id":"p305_l15","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"The potential for AI to transform the juvenile justice system is huge. There are ways to harness the power of AI responsibly. Focusing on applications like voice-to-text, summarization, and personalized updates, we can improve efficiency, communication, and overall outcomes for young individuals without perpetuating biases. As we implement the technology, we need to be aware of and address data security and privacy concerns."}
{"id":"p305_l16","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"As we continue to innovate and refine our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software, we are excited about the opportunities that AI presents to support caseworkers, probation officers, and, most importantly, the youth they serve.

Namely, support for OAuth 2.0 was added. On the surface, this change appears to be beneficial; however, this introduces a breaking change. In environments that use unsecure SMTP servers, emails were failing. They were being routed through the new MailKit implementation. By default, MailKit will require the connection made to the SMTP server to use TLS/SSL."}
{"id":"p311_l2","pageTitle":"K1H1ESIQFFNC","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/kentico-12-hotfix-email-sending-issues-quick-fix/","text":"Currently, Kentico version 12.0.102 has been released and provides ISmtpClientFactory. This interface allows us to create a MailKit client. If you have a more advanced use case, the following solution will likely not be beneficial for you. Instead, you can upgrade to version 12.0.102 and create the fix that fits your needs."}
{"id":"p311_l3","pageTitle":"K1H1ESIQFFNC","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/kentico-12-hotfix-email-sending-issues-quick-fix/","text":"As a quick fix, what we\u2019ve done is override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client from the System.Net.Mail namespace. The methods SendEmailInternal and SendEmailAsyncInternal are where we override the logic. Since the internal email provider has limited accessibility levels, we needed to copy various methods from the original provider into our custom provider."}
{"id":"p311_l4","pageTitle":"K1H1ESIQFFNC","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/kentico-12-hotfix-email-sending-issues-quick-fix/","text":"In conclusion, the introduction of support for OAuth 2.0 in Kentico version 12.0.101 was a welcome change, but it also brought about an unintended consequence for environments that use unsecure SMTP servers. This led to email failures when routing through the new MailKit implementation, which required TLS/SSL connections to the SMTP server. A quick fix for the issue is to override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client, which requires copying various methods into a custom provider due to limited accessibility levels. Overall, this experience highlights the importance of careful consideration and testing of changes to underlying implementations in software updates."}

That information lives inside a brain trust that, if left untapped, runs the risk of leaving vital knowledge out that could be crucial in informing the direction of your project. A good discovery team helps ensure that the work you\u2019ve done in gathering requirements is honored and shared so a plan can be assembled (see what I did there?)."}

In that case, the information you\u2019ve curated and the technical requirements you\u2019ve assembled will remain unrevealed.Discovery is a commitment. It takes time, consistency, and diligence to ensure that all your project needs get unearthed.

If you have a large site with many page types, this can be a daunting task. It becomes even more problematic when multiple page types contain the same field names. Every search setting must be correct, or either the indexing will fail, or the queries will fail. There is no way to know if you have your settings correct unless you try and rebuild the indexes or, after waiting for the indexes to build and submit a query. Troubleshooting this can be very time-consuming and is exacerbated when you have many page types."}

You could probably use Kentico\u2019s page type code generator and decorate those attributes. Still, any time you re-generate the code, you need to remember that you have attributes in your generated code. The way I have found that works best is to create POCOs (plain Old C# Object) based on the page types. The downside here is making sure you keep them updated when you add/remove fields on the page types."}

Using a code-first approach is just one way to make this process a little easier. Attributes are a way to keep your settings contained in version control, but there are a few caveats. Since the settings are now in version control, any changes you want to make to your indexes must be done with code. You must also keep your POCOs up to date when adding any fields you want to be included in your indexes. I find this inconvenience makes up for the time-consuming complexities when manually managing your search settings."}

It can save time and keep code cleaner to do validations on data using these Data Annotations."}
{"id":"p329_l2","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"These Data Annotations are Decorations that look like tags for methods, fields, and properties. Some commonly used Decorations for fields and properties are [Required], [MaxLength], and [MinLength]. Decorations aren\u2019t limited to just fields or properties, they can also be used on methods. This is commonly seen in controllers such as [HttpPost], [HttpGet], [Authorize], and [ValidateAntiforgeryToken]. Even the class for an API controller may be decorated with the [Route] attribute to specify how the controller and its methods should be found."}
{"id":"p329_l3","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"Sometimes, we need to validate a field in a way that isn\u2019t handled out of the box, or sometimes we just want a little more control over the messages from the validation. There are plenty of reasons to create a custom validation, and they aren\u2019t all that scary. Let\u2019s say for password validation, there are four different requirements:"}
{"id":"p329_l4","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"This can be handled with a single Regex, but the error message for each part of the validation will not let the user know exactly which requirement was not met. However, the Regex Data Annotation only allows one instance per field/property, so it\u2019s not possible to add one for each individual error message."}
{"id":"p329_l5","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"We have a couple of different solutions here; we could create a validation attribute for a custom regex validation that allows multiple attributes to be applied to a single field or create a custom attribute that contains the regex already but returns the error message for each regex condition if it does not exist. I prefer the latter, as modifying this later will be easier if the validation requirements change. Since the Regex validation is done in the data annotation logic, only the attribute would need to be modified to update the password validation for any password using this attribute. Creating an attribute that takes in a regex validation and allows multiple would be helpful in places where there may be a need to have different Regex validations, likely for something that is not a password."}
{"id":"p329_l6","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"Before I create the attribute, I want to separate the validation itself. This way, if there is any reason to do a password validation outside of the attribute itself, it can be called on any string as an extension. This will go in a PasswordValidationExtension in the same location as other extensions for the project. For each of the error messages, I am going to be using Kentico resource strings so they are easy to maintain if the site owners ever want to change them."}
{"id":"p329_l7","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"With the logic for the password validation out of the way, the attribute can be created to be used for the password validation. To make a class usable as an attribute, that class needs to inherit from the ValidationAttribute class. Then add the AttributeUsage attribute, and the types it will target. Attributes can target other types as well, including methods. This can be used to describe the method or prevent execution of the method, like the [ValidateAntiforgeryToken] or [AuthorizeAttribute]. Below is the PasswordValidationAttribute, which goes in a location for all custom validations in the project."}
{"id":"p329_l8","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"For attributes that need to be applied multiple times, add AllowMultiple=true in the AttributeUsage decoration for the class being used as an attribute. This validation does not need to be applied multiple times to the same field, but below is what it would look like for an Attribute that would."}
{"id":"p329_l9","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"All that\u2019s left now is to decorate the fields needing validation with the newly created Data Annotation. That annotation then validates the field and will pass the errors to the front end if there are any. The override for IsValid tells the attribute how to validate the field or property this Data Annotation is on. This is the method that needs to be overridden with custom logic when creating any custom validation. The override for FormatErrorMessage is only needed if the message will need to be formatted. The ErrorMessage property is inherited from the ValidationAttribute class, so setting this field on validation without overriding the FormatErrorMessage method will still work if you wish to define the error message in the Attribute itself."}
{"id":"p329_l10","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"Any property with a Data Annotation will be validated automatically when a form is submitted with this property. Any errors that are caught in validation will invalidate the model state, allowing us to stop the submission before any other logic is run. We can then return the same view to the user, and the model state will contain the error messages needed to let the user know which form fields need attention. Now, a password can not be submitted into a form without having the four requirements from earlier. If any requirement is missing, the form is returned with a custom error message letting the user know which requirement their password did not meet."}
{"id":"p329_l11","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"This process can be used to validate any property. Change the name of the data annotation, change the logic for the validation, define the error message, and apply it to a property. Using a custom Data Annotation allows us to cover validations that are unique to an application. In this scenario, the validation could have been handled through a single Regex, but I needed more control over the error messages. With this validation, I am performing the same Regex match but updating the error specifically to what requirement(s) are missing. If my password meets 2 of the four requirements, the two missing requirements will be displayed in the returned form. This is less confusing for the user while still being clean in the backend."}

{"id":"p335_l1","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"When the global pandemic made its debut in early March of 2020, no one could have predicted what kind of profound impact it would have on the workplace. What started as a two-week initiative to \u201Cslow the curve\u201D turned into a prolonged experiment in working remotely and somehow still attempting to balance the metaphorical work/life scales. Many businesses couldn\u2019t adapt to this change and closed up shop soon after the lockdown was initiated, while others seemed to thrive.I\u2019m not going to paint the lockdown in a positive light. It was brutal for all of us. Especially for BizStream, where we pride ourselves on our unique and \u201CNationally recognized\u201D culture that includes many social gatherings, team outings, and even the occasional trip to the Bartesian (think Keurig but for alcoholic cocktails). But if I were to look at this large glass of COVID milk as half full, I recognize that we did pick up some decent habits along the way."}
{"id":"p335_l2","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"In hindsight, the COVID lockdown was one big forced social experiment. It took us all well out of our comfort zones. I remember gripping and grasping for a sense of normalcy as one week of lockdown turned into one month, one quarter, and eventually one full year. We weren\u2019t really given a choice. You either adapt, or you wallow in self-pity. When you are forced into change, a lot of good can come out of it. We began to realize that work can still happen remotely. That a company is not defined by a brick-and-mortar building but by an amalgamation of people working together through trust building teams. We found new platforms for social engagement. New ways of approaching workloads and even better creative ways of praising each other for the work we are so humbly proud of. But above all, it taught us the importance of challenging societal norms both inside and outside of the workplace."}
{"id":"p335_l3","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"Okay, enough pandemic talk. It\u2019s now 2022, and we are back in the office with our newfound knowledge, which extends far beyond using hand sanitizer ten times a day. Even before the pandemic, our leadership at BizStream would often remind us to question everything. Question our processes. Our tech stacks. Question why we work five day work weeks.. As a collaborative unit, we are encouraged to ask questions, challenge \u201Cstandards,\u201D and bring new ideas to the table. Don\u2019t complain just to complain. That hinders progress, and you will be put into the cone of shame.."}
{"id":"p335_l4","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"This is not a new thing for us, but quite honestly, we weren\u2019t very good at it up until recently. Shortly after our teams began funneling back into the office, we carried with us a new sense of urgency to challenge the status quo and embrace change. We learned through 2020 and 2021 that life is too damn short not to try new things."}
{"id":"p335_l5","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"We used to host a monthly event called \u201CLab Day.\u201D On the last Friday of every month, our team would work on non-client work and focus on either learning something new or building a \u201CShippable\u201D product by the end of the day. It was a good idea in theory, and the event had been around since I started at BizStream back in 2016, so naturally, it was here to stay\u2026 Right?"}
{"id":"p335_l6","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"I had started to notice a trend where many developers were choosing to utilize this day to catch up on client work. But why? What had happened to this \u201Ccoveted\u201D monthly perk? We tried other ways to rejuvenate this \u201Chistorical artifact\u201D of an event, but it just wasn\u2019t working. I decided to send out a Google Poll to the entire team to get a sense of how people felt about it, and the results were pretty conclusive. Just as Harrison Ford desperately grasped for the holy grail as it teetered on the edge of oblivion, Sean Connery looked lovingly into our eyes and smiled down from heaven as he said, \u201CLet it Go.\u201D"}
{"id":"p335_l7","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"So that\u2019s what we did. A little self-examination goes a long way, folks. We put the pause on lab day, which forced our collective group to think about how we could repurpose this perk into something a little more useful."}
{"id":"p335_l8","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"Over the last year, we had been hearing a lot of reports on companies experimenting with the four-day workweek. In hindsight, it seemed to be fate that BizStream was primed for this specific experiment. We had just determined that lab days were on their way out, AND we knew from our COVID experience that we had ironed out a lot of the inefficiencies and quirks associated with remote work. The foundation was set.It seemed very doable. It would not be met without some challenges, of course, but that wasn\u2019t the point. We wanted to try something new. We challenged not only ourselves but societal norms about the \u201CAmerican five-day workweek.\u201DFor the first time in BizStream history, we closed up shop every Friday for the months of June, July, and August in 2022. Now I won\u2019t sugarcoat the end results. The perks were easy to observe right out the gate, but we also discovered many unique challenges that tested our management team in new ways, but that\u2019s not really the point of this post. We examined an issue, questioned the status quo, and put forth a new experiment that would challenge the norm. We were successful in that, and we learned so much along the way."}
{"id":"p335_l9","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"Life is too short to go through the motions. What makes working with and for BizStream is that it\u2019s full of like-minded individuals who love to try new things. Some of our experiments fail. Most succeed. We push ourselves with exciting new tech stacks, agile methodologies, four-day work weeks, and cocktails that we make up on the spot. Just another day in the life of a BizStreamer."}

Over the last several years, Figma has grown to be a hugely popular UX design program. So much so that many agencies and designers have switched to using Figma entirely for their web, product, and graphic design needs.

But most of those things Figma does better and more seamlessly. Many users of Figma were proud of the fact that it was an independent product, not made by Adobe. So that there was more competition and innovation in the design software space. To me, this is the single most important aspect of the whole deal. Many of the innovations and features of the Figma application were only possible because it was created outside of the Adobe ecosystem. Many of these features had been requested by users in Adobe\u2019s apps for years with little to no progress from Adobe."}

Not only is Adobe buying one of the most popular independent software developers, but they are willing to pay an incredible amount for it, \u201Capproximately $20 billion in cash and stock.\u201D Whoa. That\u2019s almost five times what Disney paid to acquire all of Lucasfilm; Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Industrial Light \u0026 Magic, and so much more\u2026 granted, that deal was in 2012. But to put that into perspective, Figma didn\u2019t even release its closed beta until 2015. So, in just about seven years, Figma was able to grow its valuation to five times that of Lucasfilm.

As of this writing, the deal hasn\u2019t officially closed, and Adobe and Figma haven\u2019t announced specifics for how their tools will be integrated together. (Will Figma and XD merge into one program? Which features of each program will be kept, and which will be removed?)

Having a set of design applications that all work well together is really handy when working on large design projects. By bringing Figma into Creative Cloud, Adobe makes its suite of design tools even stronger. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve found Figma\u2019s implementation of features more in line with what users ask for and more timely to the needs of the design community. Above all, I hope that Figma\u2019s spirit of innovation isn\u2019t lost in the merger.

Consequently, this also automatically marks scripts and styles inserted by the marked scripts as safe to run. For example, Google Tag Manager will insert analytics scripts when it initializes. If you\u2019re wondering about what a CSP level is, it\u2019s just the specification version. Level 3 is the latest iteration as of writing this blog post.

Nonces are a one-time use value. For CSP headers, we supply a nonce to the headers themselves and also add a nonce attribute to each inline script and style tag on our page. This way, the browser knows which inline elements to trust. If we were to statically define our nonces, they would be meaningless. An attacker could simply look at the nonce value, add it to their scripts, and inject their malicious scripts on the next request. What we are doing is using NWebsec to dynamically generate a nonce per request. That way, an attacker does not have a way to know the nonce beforehand."}

They signify requests from the admin application. cmsctx/ is present for Form Builder. Be careful with the paths; otherwise, you may accidentally collide with a live site path and leave a vulnerability. For example, you might want to add admin/ to the path list.

Join the session to see how you can leverage Cognitive Services with Azure Cognitive Search in your apps. With the newly minted semantic search abilities, this technology can provide results that are semantically closer to the intent of original query. For example, can your search return the right results for a query like \u201Cin the last 5 years\u201D or will it just return matches based on those 5 words without any context. You will also learn how to enhance and enrich search through Cognitive Service Skills like natural language processing, image analysis, and entity recognition capabilities. Don\u2019t know what those are? Well, that\u2019s not a problem because you will find out. You can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes.

Whether you are working or just using your computer for fun, it can be difficult to juggle multiple tasks while also staying productive. So what is the solution? How can you focus and manage your time more efficiently? To start, try to pinpoint the repetitive tasks you perform every day. Even if these tasks only take a few seconds at a time, they still add up and can hurt the flow of your daily processes. In general, I try to automate the tasks that can be automated and then find ways to make the remaining tasks more efficient, like using helpful keyboard shortcuts. Some repetitive tasks are inevitable, but we can still find ways to speed them up to the point where we don\u2019t even realize we are doing them. My favorite way of doing this is by using a custom application switcher that is easy to build, even easier to use, and completely free."}
{"id":"p351_l2","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"So what is a \u201Ccustom\u201D application switcher anyway? And what do I need to build and use it? In the simplest terms, an application switcher is exactly what it sounds like. It quickly switches the program or application that is currently in focus on your computer. This can be useful when you are constantly hopping back and forth between different applications and need a more streamlined way of doing so."}
{"id":"p351_l3","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"To build the application switcher, you will need a Windows computer, AutoHotkey, and your favorite text or code editor. AutoHotkey (also known as AHK) is a free, open-source Windows program for creating scripts. These scripts can be as simple or complex as you wish and can perform any number of tasks on your computer, including macros, auto-clicking, filling out forms, and more. For our purposes today, we will be using it to remap keyboard keys to open and switch to specific applications."}
{"id":"p351_l4","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"To get started, download and install AutoHotkey. There isn\u2019t much to the program itself. If you open it after installation, you will see that it is essentially a window that is filled with tutorials and documentation. Reading the documentation within the application or on the AutoHotkey site can be a great way to familiarize yourself with the program and figure out how to use it to write custom scripts. Once you feel comfortable with the general syntax of the scripting language and the functionality of the program, it is time to create our first script file."}
{"id":"p351_l5","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"Open up your favorite text or code editor. I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code because it is free and has a bunch of useful extensions that can greatly improve your experience with writing code (and scripts). My favorite VS Code extension made for AutoHotkey is AutoHotkey Plus which adds AHK language support, syntax highlighting, and debugging functionality."}
{"id":"p351_l6","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"Create a new script file and name it whatever you want; just make sure it has the \u201C.ahk\u201D file extension. For this tutorial, I named mine \u201CSwitcher.ahk\u201D. If you want your application switcher to automatically run each time you start your computer, place the script file inside the \u201CStartup\u201D folder. To get to the folder, press and hold the Windows key and then press the \u201CR\u201D key to open up the \u201CRun\u201D application. In the input next to the word \u201COpen\u201D, type \u201Cshell:startup\u201D and click OK. The \u201CStartup\u201D folder will open up in a Windows Explorer window where you can place your file."}
{"id":"p351_l7","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"When creating our AHK script, it is important to remember that each script within the script file is generally made up of two components: the key(s) to press in order to perform an action, and then the action itself. The key portion of the script can be a single key or a key combination. AutoHotkey uses the following characters to denote the modifier keys on a keyboard:"}
{"id":"p351_l8","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"Using the above symbols, if we wanted to create a shortcut by pressing Alt \u002B Windows \u002B X, the beginning of the script would look like \u201C!#x::\u201D without the quotes.Each key or key combination is followed by two colons which are then followed by the action or actions to take. It is completely up to you to decide which keys or key combinations to use in order to switch to your favorite applications. My personal favorite is using the keypad on the right side of a full-size keyboard. If you don\u2019t have a keypad, another option is to use the F1 through F12 keys (however many you wish to use). If neither of those options work for you, try using Windows \u002B Alt \u002B the first letter that your application starts with. Unsure of which to use? Set up a couple of different shortcut methods and see which one feels the most natural to you!"}
{"id":"p351_l9","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"In order to target specific applications, I use the Window Spy application that comes installed with AutoHotkey. Open it up and then open your application. With your application in focus, Window Spy will tell you information about your application that can be used to target it within a script. The most reliable way to target an application is by using the \u201Cahk_exe\u201D or the \u201Cahk_class\u201D property."}

With your script file open in your text or code editor, we can start laying out the overall structure of the script. I like to add a comment above each individual script in the file to help me quickly find the application name and what keyboard shortcut it is using. You can add comments to AHK scripts by typing a semicolon followed by the comment. If you are having a hard time deciding on applications to use in your script, try to think of which ones you use the most. I personally use Chrome, Slack, and Spotify frequently while I am working, so those are the ones I started with."}
{"id":"p351_l11","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"Using the Window Spy application, open your first application and find the value next to \u201Cahk_exe\u201D or \u201Cahk_class\u201D that you plan on using. Remember that this value needs to be unique for each application; otherwise you may run into issues. Some applications share the same \u201Cahk_class\u201D (like Chrome and Slack), so it is best to use \u201Cahk_exe\u201D in those cases."}

This function checks if the specified application is running, and if it is, it will perform an action. There is also a negated version that performs an action if the application is not running: !WinExist.

If the application exists and is in focus, we can then perform a specific action in the application when our keyboard shortcut is pressed again. I use this \u201Cspecial action\u201D to cycle through unread messages in Slack, play/pause music in Spotify, and cycle through my tabs in Chrome. The possibilities are pretty much endless, so I encourage you to get creative with your applications and workflows. Let\u2019s see how this extra function can be set up!"}

This command checks to see if our application is currently in focus and active. If the application is active, we can perform our specific action. In most cases, this specific action will end up being another keyboard shortcut, but you can perform additional actions as well as long as it is something that AutoHotkey supports. For this example, I am going to be using the keyboard shortcut Alt \u002B Shift \u002B Up (up arrow) in Slack, which navigates to the next unread conversation. In order to perform this keyboard shortcut, I am using the Send command."}

I have given you most of the tools to do this on your own, but I will give you one more full example that has a slightly different approach."}
{"id":"p351_l20","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"In the above example, there are some key differences from the first script. Instead of using three different \u201CIf\u201D statements, it only uses two and then utilizes an \u201CElse\u201D statement at the end to activate the application instead. The order of the script is slightly different than the first example, but they both accomplish the same end goal. If you are looking for a script for switching to Chrome and then cycling through your open tabs (by sending Ctrl \u002B Tab), this is a great one to use."}

Save your file and then double-click on it in Windows Explorer to run it. With the script running, try pressing the keyboard shortcuts associated with your applications. If successful, you should be able to launch and switch between your applications with ease."}

I am working at my computer, and Slack and Chrome aren\u2019t running yet. If I press F1, Slack will open. If I press F2, Chrome will open. If I press F1 again, Slack will become active and in focus. Finally, if I press F1 a third time, it will send the keyboard shortcut to the application to jump to my next unread conversation. If I keep pressing F1, it will keep going to the next unread conversation until there are no more new messages to read. After catching up with my messages, I can press F2 again to switch to Chrome and continue on with my work. Pretty cool, huh?"}

Hopefully, I have inspired you to create one on your own to help boost your productivity and streamline your workflows. I recommend starting with a basic version that handles a couple of different applications to start and then adding more as you get more comfortable with using it. Play around with different keyboard shortcuts and \u201Cspecial actions\u201D to really give it a custom feel. Happy scripting!"}

However, throughout your brand development process and during the creation of the first few marketing materials, you\u2019ll start to discover specific combinations of brand assets that are most effective in communicating your message and your brand. These specific combinations of assets are collectively known as your brand expression. For example, one particular combination of a large headline and brand pattern might be best for blog posts. Another combination of subtle headlines, photos, and icons might be better for anniversary announcements.

It\u2019s easy to spend so much time improving a process or an approach that, when it comes to actually putting it into action, you have to rush it and disregard half your work to make a deadline. That\u2019s why, as often as I can, I try to remove the necessity to rethink things on a continual basis. That doesn\u2019t mean continuous improvement isn\u2019t still a goal, just that I\u2019m going to check-in and improve on things every so often rather than changing things in the middle of a task.

Manual deployments are risky, stressful, and time-consuming. When I performed manual deployments in the past, they sometimes took 2 to 4 hours and I had to follow a complicated process step by step or risk taking down a live site. An automated deployment can take 5 minutes or less to complete and can be set up to run at any time without a developer being present. Many live site problems are caused by failed deployments performed by humans. A developer may forget to copy a file over to a production server or forget to run a query to update a database. Sure, there may still be issues every now and then with automated deployments, but when they do arise, we fix the automation problem instead of the deployment problem, and it\u2019s often easier to automate the rollback process, which reduces the overall downtime.Even though our deployments are automated at BizStream, we still watch every live deployment to make sure it runs smoothly. If we need to intervene or restart the process, we\u2019re standing by. Once the code is deployed, the entire team makes sure every new feature is working as expected.

We figure that starting a new job is already a little bit stressful, and having some idea of what to expect that first day will look like provides some comfort. The same goes with working fully remote. We don\u2019t want someone sitting at their computer not knowing who or when someone would reach out to tell them whatever comes next.

On top of that, we\u2019ve incorporated some fun icebreakers for each person to include, such as \u201CWhat is your favorite superhero?\u201D \u201CWhat is your dream car?\u201D or \u201CWhat is your favorite stompy mech movie/game/comic/manga?\u201D"}

It includes our core values, what their position is accountable and responsible for, key meetings, and provided training. We treat it as a bit of a living document that the manager reviews with the new hire every week and determines if things are on track or if we need to make some adjustments.

We were missing out on the in-office opportunities of saying hello when getting coffee or grabbing lunch together, so we decided to be more intentional about getting people together. As we are starting to move back into the office fully, we decided this is something we should keep going. Previously, we have had people that wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to work with another team, so getting them connected and talking early on feels like a no-brainer at this point."}

Following the latest government mandates at the time, we would optionally invite everyone to the office and have chairs, some drinks, pre-packaged snacks, and hang out from a short distance (you all know the drill by now) in our parking lot. While it worked fine to do everything virtually, there is still something to be said for face-to-face communication. It was good to bring people together (while separate) for some social interaction and get to know each other in person."}

Doing so allows for successful implementation, the ability to achieve realistic timelines, and ultimately, the delivery of a full-fledged, pixel-perfect web complaint site to your client. In order to achieve these project milestones, you must design with your developer in mind.

Consistent layouts are key to making sure your designs are perfectly implemented in code. The first steps in designing always start with determining your canvas, layout, and grid settings. Using the grid is crucial to allow for fluid and responsive design and is a big determining factor in how consistent your design project will be. What exactly is the grid? Is a twelve-column layout that has become standard in design due to its flexibility in dividing columns for responsive design.

From seminars to certifications, it is becoming super important to make sure that designers and developers aren\u2019t only gaining knowledge of, but also creating their work based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). So why is this so important? As an engineer, you need to make sure that your product is accessible and has a consistent user experience for all of its users. The WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) states, \u201CMaking the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society.

A common issue I find when I am looking at certain designs or websites is regarding their color palette being used. One accessibility rule states your site must \u00A0\u2018ensure that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text\u2019. This seems simple enough but is often a common issue missed by many by the time it gets into the hands of the developer. Luckily, there are countless tools, both native and for download, to help guide you to make sure your site is compliant. One tool I commonly use to create my color palette for any project is WebAIM\u2019s color contrast checker.

However, when it gets the collections, it will perform a \u201CUNION ALL\u201D across all the assessments and their various properties.

Maybe you\u2019ve already developed a working solution using native DOM functionality or a library such as jQuery. If not, no problem!Our goal is to write some code that will allow us to execute a callback function when we click \u201Celsewhere\u201D or outside of a target element\u2019s descendant elements. We want our functionality to be reusable amongst multiple target elements such as custom dropdown menus. Oh, and we\u2019re using Angular 4.In summary, we want to use an Attribute Directive on our target element that sets up a Host Listener that listens for a click Mouse Event on the Document and emits the Mouse Event if the element being clicked is not a descendant of our target element. Our template containing the target element will bind a callback function to this mouse event and close the dropdown menu.That was a bit of a mouthful. Let\u2019s break it down."}

According to the official Angular docs at the time of this writing,\u00A0Attribute Directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.So, like the definition states, we will be changing the behavior of our target element. We want our target element to emit an event when there is a mouse click outside of any of its descendant elements. Let\u2019s take a look at our directive definition before we add any functionality to it."}
{"id":"p415_l3","pageTitle":"ACED","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/angular-click-elsewhere-directive/","text":"Using the\u00A0@Directive\u00A0decorator we can decorate a class as an Angular Directive. Notice the\u00A0selector\u00A0value: \u2018[clickElsewhere]\u2019. Since we want to be able to use this directive as an attribute on our target element, we are using square brackets which will select the attribute named \u2018clickElsewhere\u2019.We also inject a reference to the target element that this directive is attached to using\u00A0ElementRef. The reference to the target element is possible via the normal Angular dependency injection pipeline."}
{"id":"p415_l4","pageTitle":"ACED","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/angular-click-elsewhere-directive/","text":"As you can see, we\u2019ve imported a few more things from the @angular/core package that we need to complete this implementation:\u00A0EventEmitter,\u00A0HostListener\u00A0and\u00A0Output.We\u2019ve created a property called\u00A0clickElsewhere\u00A0and decorated it with the\u00A0@Output() decorator to let Angular know this is an output property. This property is an\u00A0EventEmitter\u00A0and based on its type parameter:\u00A0MouseEvent, it will emit mouse events. Event Emitters allow us to emit events up to our containing components. Notice the name of the output property we\u2019ve created has the exact same as the selector for our directive:\u00A0clickElsewhere. This allows us to use a very concise syntax when using this directive in a template, which we will see later.Finally, we\u2019ve defined an\u00A0onDocumentClick\u00A0function and decorated it with the\u00A0@HostListener\u00A0decorator. The Host Listener allow us to listen to an event on the host \u2013 which is the target element that this directive will be attached to. The first parameter of the @HostListener decorator is the event name. The second parameter is an array of arguments that are emitted in the event. Since we want to listen to click events on the whole document and not just the directive\u2019s host, we went a step further and added document as our target before the click event name: document:click.The @HostListener decorator also passes the arguments, $event in our case, into the function it\u2019s decorating. So, our function will have one parameter: event, which will be of type MouseEvent.Our function is pretty simple, it checks to see if the element being clicked on is NOT contained within the element that our directive is attached to. If the user clicked elsewhere or outside of the element that our directive is attached to, then we emit the mouse event as an output. To achieve this, we are taking advantage of the\u00A0EventEmitter\u00A0to emit the mouse event as our Output property."}

The second thing we\u2019re doing is binding the\u00A0closeDropdown()\u00A0callback function to the @Output() property in our directive that is also called\u00A0clickElsewhere. Since the directive\u2019s selector and output property both share the same name we are able to do this with a nice short syntax.If our directive\u2019s selector and output property had different names, we would have to declare the selector attribute on the target element, and bind to the output property separately. So, if we were to rename the output property to\u00A0clickOff, we would have to use the directive like this:"}

It gets confused fairly easily, to tell you the truth. Sometimes you need to take your superior human brain into the XML guts, root around, and fix some messes. Here\u2019s how.I want to take a second here to remind you to backup, branch, or at least commit your code while it\u2019s in a good state. You\u2019re going to be messing with complicated XML and if you delete the wrong thing, or change the structure incorrectly you could have a hard time fixing it. You might have to revert and start again. You have been warned\u2026Right-click on your EDMX file, select\u00A0Open With\u2026, then select\u00A0XML (Text) Editor.

If you change your database structure and remove a field or two then refresh your model, chances are those fields are still going to be hanging around in your models causing confusion. You\u2019re going to need to do the wizard\u2019s job and remove those fields for good.Using the instructions above, open up your EDMX as XML. Search the text for the name of the field you changed/removed. It will appear 4-5 times if it\u2019s a normal field, and considerably more if it\u2019s any kind of primary/foreign key. Go through all instances and modify the XML to your liking for each. In the case of removing a field, you\u2019ll just remove all traces of that field the EDMX file."}

It\u2019s actually looking at the XML we just talked about and deciding whether it needs to change any of your generated classes as a result. It doesn\u2019t always do the best job of changing existing classes. Sometimes you might have done something to confuse it and it doesn\u2019t update the classes as you\u2019d expect. For instance, take removing or renaming a field from your database as an example. You don\u2019t want to modify those generated classes, because at some point you\u2019ll regenerate them and all your changes will be overwritten. You might just want to have VS start over and try again from scratch.To do this, find the\u00A0[YourDatabase].tt\u00A0file (not to be confused with the [YourDatabase].Context.tt file), and expand the cs files below it. You\u2019ll see one file for each database table you\u2019ve imported. Highlight all of the files and delete them all. Trust me, it will be ok. Once deleted, right-click on the [YourDatabase].tt file and select\u00A0Run Custom Tool. Give it a few seconds to think and all your classes will be regenerated again."}

One example is multiple relationships to the same table. For instance, in my legacy application I sometimes have tables with multiple relationships back to the user table. (A table with fields like CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy, SubmittedBy, etc.) The generated class will contain objects like User, User1, User2, etc. Not really helpful when you\u2019re using those classes in code. You can do a few things to make your generated classes more helpful. Let\u2019s dive into the T4 templates.Open the [YourDatabase].tt (T4 Template) file. This contains the template used to generate all the classes for your database tables. In it, you\u2019ll see each part of a class file with other methods and properties sprinkled in. You can do a ton of cool things inside this file to help make your generated classes easier to use. I\u2019m going to show you one of these neat tricks.Search the file for\u00A0\u201Cforeach (var navigationProperty in navigationProperties)\u201D. This is going to loop through all the relationships (navigation properties) in the class it\u2019s working on. A little farther down you\u2019ll see\u00A0\u003C#=codeStringGenerator.NavigationProperty(navigationProperty)#\u003E. This is going to output the property text, think public User User3 { get; set; }.

{"id":"p451_l2","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/mark-schmidt","text":"The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that\u2019s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU\u2019s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it.

At BizStream, we don\u2019t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don\u2019t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren\u2019t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships.

{"id":"p451_l7","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/mark-schmidt","text":"The reason BizStream\u2019s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn\u2019t want to work at a typical job. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to?
