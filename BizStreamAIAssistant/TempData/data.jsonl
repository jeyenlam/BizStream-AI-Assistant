{"id":"33","pageTitle":"Our History","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/history/","text":"Our History\nWell, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm\u2019s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.\nMany may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.\nAs\u00A0we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream!\u00A0\nIn 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn\u2019t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting \u2026\nVisit the NoWaterBall site\nTo accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!\nThe GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream\u2019s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!\nIn 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!\nRemember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.\nIn 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!\nBizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn\u2019t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they\u2019ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.\nThis program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to\u00A0BizStream Academy\u00A0and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!\nIn 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer\u2019s loft with a firefighter\u2019s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!\nIn 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal\u2019s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream\u2019s unique company structure.\nRead the 40 Under Forty \u2013 2014 \u2013 Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue\nOur implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico\u2019s 1,000\u002B global partners!\nOver seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!\nIn 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by\u00A0Michigan Celebrates Small Business!\nThe theme for the year was \u2018Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs\u2019 and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.\nBizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico\u2019s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai\u00A0Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!\nIn 2018, we were recognized as a\u00A0National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For\u00AE\u00A0winner! We\u2019ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!\nIn 2019, it was Brian\u2019s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.\nRead the 40 Under 40 \u2013 Business Leaders \u2013 2019 \u2013 Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue\nWith the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.\nIn 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!\nIn 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!\nNow that we\u2019re officially 21, we\u2019ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We\u2019ve come a long way over the years \u2013 from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services \u2013 whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.\nIt\u2019s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!\nIn 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni\u2014Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!\nIn 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions\u2014laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

In a world where people consume content on multiple devices and in many formats, ensuring a great experience is critical.\nA headless content management system (CMS) can be a powerful solution\u2014not only for your users, but also for marketers and developers supporting content creation and development.\nBy separating the back end from the front end, headless CMS can transform the way users experience your content\u2014and the way companies approach content development.\nRead on to learn why a headless CMS might be a smart choice for organizations aiming to streamline content delivery across multiple platforms.\nThe most important thing to know about a headless CMS is that it separates the creation and storage of content (back end) from the presentation and delivery (front end). Known as \u201Cdecoupled\u201D architecture, this approach can offer superior flexibility, scalability, site speed, and security.\nUnlike a traditional CMS, where content is tied to a pre-set theme, a headless CMS delivers it through Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs).\nKey takeaway: A headless CMS stores and manages your content, while a presentation tool (website or mobile app) presents the content.\nThis structure may make it easier to manage, deliver, and repurpose your content to match the omnichannel environment your customers use.\nTo support the best possible delivery of content across a variety of formats, the headless approach involves creating modular content components that can be deployed to any type of front end. For example, suppose you\u2019re creating a web page that includes:\nWith a traditional CMS, you might break out a couple of these items in separate entry fields, but more likely, you\u2019d just lay them out all together in a single content object using a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor.\nA headless system, such as Storyblok or similar platforms, breaks these components down even further and doesn\u2019t mix content, layout, and design\u2014keeping the end display more flexible:\nThe CMS enables you to specify which of these pieces should link with others by adding tags and taxonomy notations to each item.\nWith this information, developers can use programmatic APIs to pull the content into a variety of front ends. The results can be more adaptable and reusable than a big block of content designed for a static webpage shoehorned into other formats.\nA traditional, monolithic CMS may feel limiting depending on project goals or complexity. Its architecture can sometimes create workflow bottlenecks or reduce flexibility.\nCommon challenges include:\nAs a marketer, you need to get campaigns off the ground fast. A headless CMS\u2019 centralized content repository can make it easier to create content once and publish it across multiple channels\u2014often with less reliance on development teams.\nIf you choose a headless CMS with a visual editor, like Storyblok or other similar platforms, your content creators can preview website changes in real time.\nA headless approach can also offer advantages in content strategy. Thinking about content in modular, reusable chunks helps tighten messaging and lead users toward a clear outcome.\nIt encourages deeper content evaluation:\nThis more granular approach can support improved taxonomy, tagging, and reuse\u2014benefiting both users and marketers.\nBecause a headless CMS separates the back end from the front end, developers can work with the technologies they prefer. In contrast, traditional CMS platforms may restrict your programming language or integration options.\nA headless CMS can empower your team to adopt best-of-breed tools that align with your business goals\u2014whether that\u2019s marketing automation, ecommerce, or another integration.\nMany developers work in agile environments. A headless CMS can fit well with these workflows, helping marketing and development teams work in sync.\nWe can help. BizStream brings deep experience across multiple CMS platforms\u2014from traditional solutions like Kentico to modern headless CMSs like Storyblok, Kontent.ai, and Payload. Whether you\u2019re working with an existing platform or exploring new options, we help you assess your needs and recommend the best-fit approach for your business, team, and tech stack.\nBy working with us, you\u2019ll get:\nThis post was written by Kile Lindgren, a Solution Architect at BizStream and an official Storyblok Ambassador.

But it\u2019s only the beginning of what they envision for their organization.\nIn upcoming iterations of the site, the XtremeAg team will work with BizStream to add:\nAs their dedicated partner, the BizStream team never stops working for XtremeAg. We\u2019ll always be ready to help them evolve the site as their business and member needs change.\nWe knew we were doing something different in agriculture, with no clear guide on how to develop our online presence. Right from the start, BizStream got on board with our vision\u2014and quickly turned into trusted advisors.\nThe award-winning Growers of XtremeAg were in high demand for events and speaking engagements. But they wanted to expand their reach and share more of their expertise. They realized that an online member community would be ideal, so they turned to BizStream to build a fully functional member platform\u2014from the ground up.\nHowever, almost immediately after that site launch, they realized that they\u2019d chosen the wrong medium for their mobile audience. We helped the Growers make a hard shift, customizing their blog-centric membership site to enable video publishing at scale.\nSince that launch, the XtremeAg Growers have proven to be highly capable content publishers, producing thousands of pieces of video content and expanding across media formats, including webinars and podcasts, as well as live events.\nNow, they were set to launch a new TV series, adding yet another media channel. With a site already past its limits and an audience whose viewing habits turn on a dime, the XtremeAg team knew they needed another evolution.\nThey asked BizStream to re-imagine their site, empowering their teams with a more media-forward platform and empowering their users with more efficient navigation, more relevant search and content recommendations, and a better user experience.\nThe ultimate goal was to not just get more people to engage\u2014but also keep them connected to content that would truly help them with their specific farming needs and challenges.\nFor XtremeAg\u2019s Growers and partnering sponsors, member engagement means empowering viewers to consume not just the first video they came for but also the next video\u2026and the next\u2026and the next.\nIt needs to be bingeable. Like YouTube. Or Spotify.\nIt needs to be personally relevant, enabling visitors to easily:\nIt needs to be future-proof, to make immediate improvements and position them for ongoing evolution.\nSurface more content\nImprove visibility of recent content\nOptimize onsite search\nSimplify site content management\nImprove overall site usability, especially for mobile users\nReduce clicks\nUse space more efficiently\nIncrease content personalization\nImprove SEO rankings\nWe recommended moving the member website to Storyblok, one of our top-pick headless content management systems.\nWhen modernizing a website, transitioning from traditional to headless CMS is becoming a higher priority for member-based organizations like XtremeAg.\nStoryblok\u2019s best-in-class Visual Editor, best practices configured by the BizStream dev team, dramatically improves the XtremeAg team\u2019s content management experience with:\nStoryblok easily enabled us to integrate the Algolia Recommends AI search tool into the site, feeding it live analytics data to inform the machine learning application and enable more meaningful content discovery:\nStoryblok flexibly accommodates both API integrations and custom feature builds, so our team was able to create an optimized video experience that mimics other, familiar media sites, including:\nBecause we had built XtremeAg\u2019s original site and have remained their hands-on technical partner, BizStream was already in a strong position to remove roadblocks and accelerate the new website.\nXtremeAg\u2019s team was one of the first of our clients to leverage our Web Accelerator for Storyblok\u2014a complete starter site that with 90% of the components needed to build a website faster and maximize available resources. With much of the basic web development already in place, we were able to focus resources on more complex features that personalize, filter, and display their content in unique ways.\nStarting with wireframes allowed us to work through potential changes in a cost-effective manner. We produced over 30 wires to document the change before moving to design.\nOnce new layouts were approved, we updated the site design to refresh the established brand and enable improved site navigation, quick links, content personalization, flexible headers, and more.\nAs with other associations, XtremeAg greatly values their partner sponsorships. Our new design improves partner visibility and enhances member access to partner websites, videos, events, and products.\nBecause the XtremeAg site contains an enormous amount of structured content, it helped that we had already established strong tagging and taxonomy. With that in place, we were able to create a highly intuitive content structure for the site editors. During the content migration, we also pulled video transcripts and created strong metadata across the pages to make the content consumable for both viewers and search engines.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"46","pageTitle":"TUFAMME","url":"https://bizstream.com/project/crunchyroll/","text":"Transforming UX for a Multilingual Media Enterprise\nCrunchyroll brings anime fans the content they love\u2014anytime, anywhere. With an extensive library and immersive experiences, Crunchyroll takes anime beyond the screen, connecting fans and creators on a global scale. As a joint venture between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Japan-based Aniplex, Crunchyroll unites the world of anime under one vibrant platform.\nList, List\nThe resulting Crunchyroll News site is light years ahead of where it started.\nContent creators and editors have the power to leverage best practices in SEO, syndication, content discovery, and navigation to attract, engage, and convert anime fans from around the world.\nSite visitors now enjoy a truly mobile-first experience, with intuitive navigation, easy ways to find and interact with the content they want on any screen or device, and seamless crossover into the rest of the Crunchyroll ecosystem.\nTo ensure the experience is uninterrupted, the site is geo-adaptive to display content, searches, and RSS feeds in each users\u2019 preferred language. And users can customize their experience further with the option to toggle between dark-mode and light-mode versions of the site.\nIn the midst of an enterprise-scale site redesign, Crunchyroll has made the most of their opportunity, establishing Crunchyroll News as the go-to source for anime news, exploration, and engagement.\nBizStream has been able to do more for us in 2 months than our other partners were able to do in a year\u2014and they\u2019ve become a key strategic partner for our organization. Their pragmatic approach, responsiveness to our requests, and guidance on marketing strategy has made them an invaluable resource for Investments \u0026 Wealth Institute.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for very large corporate enterprises to have multi-layered websites comprising hundreds\u2014even thousands\u2014of pages.\nBut media organizations\u2014such as the hugely popular anime streaming site Crunchyroll\u2014house hundreds of thousands of pages and articles. Crunchyroll News, which is just one facet of the organization\u2019s digital presence, provides continuous news and insights to tens of millions of subscribers and freemium members.\nThe company was working on the release of new corporate branding and a full site redesign, which included integrating the Crunchyroll News site into their ecosystem of videos, manga, games, and merchandise.\nIn addition, the migration was a unique opportunity to make dramatic improvements in user experience, organic traffic, engagement, and ultimately, subscriptions. The Crunchyroll team knew that the news site had been neglected, and they were ready to modernize it.\nIt was a tremendous chance to make a meaningful difference for both internal and external users.\nTo ensure the news site migration met both their timeline and their requirements, Crunchyroll\u2019s technical team decided to bring an outside developer team into the project to work alongside their in-house developers. But they didn\u2019t want just any provider; they needed a fully dedicated dev team with specific knowledge of user experience (UX) design, information architecture design, and their chosen CMS:\u00A0Storyblok.\nAs a certified Storyblok partner, BizStream was uniquely positioned to take on their migration, providing experienced Storyblok developers dedicated to completing the news site. And because we are a full-service agency, we also understand the importance of elevating UX design, SEO, and site usability along with tailored CMS configuration and deployment.\nBut for Crunchyroll, the deciding factor was discovering BizStream\u2019s expertise in creating tailored CMS environments that empower content editors\u2014now and over the long term.\nMost developer teams have the ability to configure in-the-box features and enable basic functionality. But Crunchyroll\u2019s news editorial team is an outside-the-box group. They have a large core team and hundreds of contributors publishing in nearly a dozen languages from countries around the world. Their Storyblok configuration needed to be highly adaptable\u2014empowering editors to tell an endless variety of stories, using every kind of media\u2014within an intuitive content structure and defined branding.\nBecause BizStream specializes in that kind of nuanced focus on content editor usability, we became Crunchyroll\u2019s top choice.\nOur experienced dev team provided recommendations to help Crunchyroll make the most of Storyblok\u2019s features.\nBefore beginning our work with Crunchyroll, we put in place a project management structure that would enable true partnership with their internal team.\nThe sheer size of the full ecosystem migration demanded that effort be divided between our teams.

Because of the volume of content involved\u2014and because the original site was not responsive\u2014we knew moving text and images into Storyblok would not be straightforward.\nWe wrote custom tools for this audit, which informed our content modeling exercises.\nThen, we created multiple content models, presenting each to the Crunchyroll team and refining each iteration to ensure the final model would provide the editing experience their teams required.\nOur UX design experts leveraged Crunchyroll\u2019s brand design system and specifications to create a set of high-fidelity wireframes, a critical time- and cost-saving step for complex sites.\nWe created pixel-perfect responsive designs for mobile and desktop, with variants for light and dark modes.\nWe vetted a full range of ADA-compliant colors for their design system, ensuring both light and dark modes meet the AA standard of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\nThe News site supports content in 11 languages, including Arabic, which reads right-to-left. We created the completely flipped page design shown here to ensure RTL balance and readability.\nAs we moved into technical development, our team set up the Storyblok space for Crunchyroll News.\nWe applied the content structure, built a set of core pages for reuse across content categories, and created reusable block components to empower editors to customize new pages.\nWith these customized, composable components, Crunchyroll\u2019s team can tell any kind of story, incorporating any kind of content\u2014all within their approved publishing workflow and adhering to their brand guidelines.\nIn the final phase of technical development, we created a comprehensive migration script that handled the transposition of raw HTML-based posts into structured JSON.\nBefore attempting the full migration, we segmented a sample set of article pages and ran them through a complete testing process.\nA detailed quality assurance check revealed any stray issues ahead of the full migration. From there, we ran the scripts on the live environment and coordinated with the internal development team so they could finish their work before launching the new website.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

But having an experienced partner who could guide us through the process\u2014and encourage us to think as a user\u2014was very beneficial! BizStream listened. And they understood what I needed before I realized I needed it. The combination of knowledge, experience, and empathetic guidance created a fantastic final product.\nFor many associations, website redesigns are deferred maintenance\u2014always taking a back seat to projects that are more urgent, or easier, or cheaper.\nThe trouble is, the website is the front door for members. So when that entry point no longer works for you or your members, it\u2019s time to make a change.\nThat was where Big I Illinois\u2014previously Independent Insurance Agents of Illinois (IIA of IL)\u2014found themselves. This professional association provides agencies and agents with industry resources, operations support, advocacy, and vital business connections.\nBut the Director of Communications, was frustrated by the inflexibility of the site, which made it extremely difficult for her and her team to demonstrate the powerful value of Big I Illinois membership.\nBig I Illinois turned to BizStream for recommendations. She made it clear she was not looking for just another website vendor.

Now, users can see themselves in the association\u2014and find personalized pathways to the information that\u2019s truly relevant for them.\nFor users needing to access member resources and benefits, we implemented a centralized Solution Center, adding SSO and Algolia search.

Managing content on our sites has vastly improved, and mass edits and content validation has been streamlined due to our implementation of Kentico as our CMS.\nBizStream provided a wealth of knowledge throughout the entire development and change management process. Because of the way National Heritage Academies chooses to do business, many teams and individuals are required to know how to use Kentico. BizStream was able to successfully deliver a feature-rich product and also provided us with insight into how to use Kentico. From a development standpoint, BizStream was willing and open to discussing their process and melding it with our own.

{"id":"117","pageTitle":"BJTED","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/bizstreams-journey-to-embracing-dei/","text":"BizStream\u2019s Journey to Embracing DEI\nIn today\u2019s dynamic world, acknowledging the depth that diversity contributes is essential. Each individual\u2019s perspectives, molded by their life experiences, intricately weave into the vibrant fabric of our society, prompting a recognition of humanity\u2019s multifaceted nature.\nHowever, diversity alone doesn\u2019t suffice; equity and inclusion stand equally crucial. Equity addresses historical inequalities and systemic biases, ensuring impartial access to opportunities, while inclusion actively values and integrates diverse voices, nurturing a sense of belonging and inspiring innovation.\nRecognizing that diversity, equity, and inclusion extend beyond racial boundaries is also key. These principles collectively strive to dismantle barriers across intersecting identities, encompassing gender equality, diverse sexual orientations, accessible opportunities for individuals with disabilities, respect for varying cultural and religious practices, and alleviating socioeconomic disparities. Through promoting equity and cultivating genuine inclusion, we lay the foundation for a culture characterized by harmony and progress.\nAchieving the intertwined objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion involves cultivating an environment that encourages open dialogue and embraces differing viewpoints. This ongoing journey entails inviting diverse perspectives and acknowledging dissenting ideas, fostering true inclusion that actively engages with mixed thoughts.\nBizStream\u2019s transformative journey towards DEI is rooted in a commitment to educate ourselves about the profound impact of diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team members and the organizational landscape. This educational pursuit transcends surface intentions and delves into understanding the fundamental principles that underpin these concepts, acknowledging their potential to shape a more inclusive and equitable future.\nA pivotal stride was taken in 2022 when BizStream established its DEI committee. The committee\u2019s mission and purpose are defined in our DEI Committee Charter as:\nThe BizStream Committee for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) will serve as a force for good within the company, within our local communities, and within the technology industry.\nThe DEI Committee exists to:\nOne responsibility of our DEI committee is to identify and coordinate educational opportunities, workshops, and training programs to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness among employees.\nOne pivotal contributor to our journey has been Sandy Harvey, MBA, CDP, of Exodus Consulting. Sandy played a central role in guiding us through the intricacies of DEI through her Diversity Awareness and Unconscious Bias workshops.\nThis interactive and reflective course led us to explore the multifaceted characteristics we all share beyond race and gender. It highlighted how diversity awareness has evolved from eliminating discrimination to promoting active inclusion. Through these sessions, we\u2019ve understood that the more aware we are of these nuances, the better we can foster meaningful relationships.\nDelving into the depths of unconscious or implicit biases, this workshop exposed the fact that everyone possesses such biases. The workshop showcased how these biases also manifest in our professional environments, potentially leading to unhealthy behaviors and exposing organizations to discrimination and harassment risks if unchecked.\nAnother contributor was Jessica Bacon, CRCR, who presented on weight biases in the workplace.\nThis workshop casts a spotlight on the influence of body size on workplace inclusivity. The discussion centered around the impact of body size discrimination, its potential implications for BizStream, and the significance of addressing this issue.\nThese workshops are pivotal milestones in BizStream\u2019s ongoing journey towards creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace, embodying our commitment to continual growth and positive transformation.\nIncorporating pronouns in communications, email signatures, Slack profiles, and team member profiles on our website goes beyond mere adjustments; it\u2019s a meaningful step towards representation and respect for each individual\u2019s gender identity. This practice fosters a welcoming environment and acknowledges the importance of recognizing and validating diverse identities within our team.\nBeyond BizStream\u2019s internal initiatives, we actively engage with and support local endeavors. This includes our partnerships like Change the Code, a student-led non-profit organization aimed at improving gender balance within the STEM industry, and our participation in Holland Pride, a pivotal event organized by Out on the Lakeshore. By participating in these events, celebrating women in STEM and the LGBTQ\u002B community, we manifest our unwavering commitment to catalyzing broader societal changes.\nAdditional DEI efforts include commemorating Juneteenth as a company holiday, accompanied by educational initiatives, recognizing and celebrating the significance of Pride Month, and participating in\u00A0International Day of Pink, a worldwide anti-bullying and anti-homophobia event.\u00A0We hope these actions convey our unwavering determination to cultivate an inclusive workplace that genuinely embraces the diverse backgrounds and identities of all team members and their diverse family members.\nEmbracing DEI isn\u2019t just a checkbox for us; it\u2019s a mindset that influences every facet of our company culture. We cherish each individual\u2019s unique perspective and are committed to treating everyone with the same compassion and respect we expect for ourselves. By creating an equitable and inclusive workspace, we strive to foster an environment where every individual can flourish.\nThe journey isn\u2019t a one-time achievement; it\u2019s an ongoing commitment to fostering diversity, inclusivity, equity, and respect. We\u2019re dedicated to learning, growing, and continuously improving as we work towards creating a more just and harmonious world for everyone.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"118","pageTitle":"Our History","url":"https://bizstream.com/history/","text":"Our History\nWell, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm\u2019s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.\nMany may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.\nAs\u00A0we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream!\u00A0\nIn 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn\u2019t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting \u2026\nVisit the NoWaterBall site\nTo accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!\nThe GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream\u2019s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!\nIn 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!\nRemember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.\nIn 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!\nBizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn\u2019t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they\u2019ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.\nThis program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to\u00A0BizStream Academy\u00A0and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!\nIn 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer\u2019s loft with a firefighter\u2019s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!\nIn 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal\u2019s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream\u2019s unique company structure.\nRead the 40 Under Forty \u2013 2014 \u2013 Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue\nOur implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico\u2019s 1,000\u002B global partners!\nOver seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!\nIn 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by\u00A0Michigan Celebrates Small Business!\nThe theme for the year was \u2018Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs\u2019 and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.\nBizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico\u2019s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai\u00A0Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!\nIn 2018, we were recognized as a\u00A0National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For\u00AE\u00A0winner! We\u2019ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!\nIn 2019, it was Brian\u2019s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.\nRead the 40 Under 40 \u2013 Business Leaders \u2013 2019 \u2013 Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue\nWith the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.\nIn 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!\nIn 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!\nNow that we\u2019re officially 21, we\u2019ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We\u2019ve come a long way over the years \u2013 from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services \u2013 whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.\nIt\u2019s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!\nIn 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni\u2014Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!\nIn 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions\u2014laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"119","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt/","text":"Mark Schmidt\nOur motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.\nThe first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that\u2019s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU\u2019s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.\nAfter GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.\nWith a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That\u2019s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don\u2019t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That\u2019s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.\nAt BizStream, we\u2019ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it\u2019s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be clich\u00E9, but it\u2019s true \u2014 we work hard and we play hard.\nI\u2019ve found that if you\u2019re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, and I\u2019m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don\u2019t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don\u2019t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren\u2019t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.\nThe reason BizStream\u2019s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn\u2019t want to work at a typical job. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let\u2019s make it something we want to do.\nThis mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We\u2019ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).\nIn addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College\u2019s computer sciences department. It\u2019s really cool because I\u2019m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I\u2019m not at work, I\u2019m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I\u2019ve done a lot of home automation, and I\u2019m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.\nWork is such a big part of most everyone\u2019s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.\nThere\u2019s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: \u201CChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\u201D That\u2019s where it\u2019s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren\u2019t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"120","pageTitle":"Brian McKeiver","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/brian-mckeiver/","text":"Brian McKeiver\nI like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nI joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn\u2019t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.\nThat same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.\nI went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).\nI was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.\nI like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nWe have a group of like-minded people here. There\u2019s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I\u2019m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it.\u00A0When people think it can\u2019t be done, we\u2019ve done it.\nI love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It\u2019s what I\u2019d do even if BizStream didn\u2019t exist. What we do at BizStream isn\u2019t easy, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00A0It\u2019s challenging, sure, but I couldn\u2019t be in a job that wasn\u2019t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.\nIt also makes me happy that we\u2019ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the\u00A0BizStream Academy\u00A0\u2014 a program where we offer development training for students \u2014 and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.\nI work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work,\u00A0which is one of the great things about BizStream \u2014 the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I\u2019m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.\nWhen I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),\u00A0 and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy.\u00A0I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico\u2019s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world.\u00A0When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.\nAs a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department.

{"id":"159","pageTitle":"BIAGPTWBINFE","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/bizstream-is-a-great-place-to-work-but-its-not-for-everyone/","text":"BizStream Is a GREAT Place to Work, but It\u2019s NOT for Everyone\nWhen BizStream started in 2001 it was small and made up of mostly friends and family. We were all on the same page and everyone knew what BizStream was about. But as we grew and as we brought on more people, we slowly began to realize that maybe our vision wasn\u2019t being seen by everyone. The \u201CBizStream way\u201D was becoming blurred. As much as we hate to have a bunch of rules in place and things in writing, it became pretty clear that if we wanted to keep our unique culture and [kick-ass] work ethic, that we needed to lay it out in black and white for our people. Because, as much as we aren\u2019t about a bunch of rules, we are about complete transparency, setting our team up for success, and keeping BizStream an awesome place to work for hard-working people. As our team continues to grow we want to make sure we\u2019re bringing people on that are a great fit for BizStream, and on the flip side, that they can somewhat easily determine if this is a place that they want to be a part of before they even walk into an interview with us.\nIt became pretty apparent that we needed to do a few things:\nThe first thing our leadership team wanted to define was BizStream\u2019s Core Focus. We started by asking ourselves questions like, \u201CWhy do we get up in the morning? Why does BizStream exist?\u201D And after a fairly quick discussion, most of us came to a very similar reason. We finalized our Core Focus as:\nWe feel it really hits the nail on the head. We love technology, we love building cool things and we also know that the majority of our waking hours are spent at work. So, if we are spending that much time at work, we better enjoy it. We believe it is our team that makes us WANT to come to work versus the majority of the workforce, that DREADS coming to work. I\u2019ve said it in the past, \u201CI want to go to work every day and write code with my friends\u201D, that\u2019s why I started BizStream, and it\u2019s really important to me that we keep it that way. The last part of our core focus, \u201Chave a positive impact on others\u201D is because Brian\u00A0(co-founder) and I want to work with people that are not just here for themselves. It\u2019s a big world out there and we strongly feel one of the best things we can do as a human is to positively impact as many other people as possible. It also means doing as much in the community as we can. This is why many of us at BizStream are coaches, scoutmasters, youth group leaders, robotics team advisers, BizStream Academy mentors and so much more. Many of us especially love working with youth, education, and technology.\nNow it was time to define what we do, what we are the best at, how we are unique, and the kind of projects we excel at. \u00A0We\u2019ve always excelled in using software to find solutions to unique, complicated problems. It\u2019s what we love to do. Our team gets excited from digging into complex issues and discovering new ways to solve them with programming. One of the common phrases you\u2019ll hear around here is \u201CWe are experts in things we\u2019ve never done before\u201D. Of course, that only refers to the world of programming. I wouldn\u2019t ask our team members to land a 747 or do brain surgery. But when it comes to programming and complex integrations, \u201Cwe got this\u201D. After all that, we landed with this as our niche:\nWe enjoy working on the hard stuff. We love it when we hear that a different vendor told the client that \u201Cit\u2019s impossible, or too complex, or just too hard\u201D\u2026 hah! Bring it on. We aren\u2019t really into making yet another simple, static brochure site that has nothing complicated going on in it. However, if it is e-commerce, multilingual, multi-site, tapping into multiple 3rd-party APIs, pulling data from an ERP, CRM or 10 other systems \u2026 our ears are perking up, and we are already thinking about possible solutions to propose to the client. These are the types of projects that our processes and teams are optimized for. Honestly, we are overkill for the smaller, simpler problems that Wix or Square Space are much better suited for.\nOur niche not only explains what we specialize in, but it also highlights what we DON\u2019T do. We are very much the IMPLEMENTERS of a project. Already have a great design agency or marketing department, or you want to use one of our design resources? Great! We have worked with many scenarios where we leverage our internal resources as well as external resources that specialize in high-end design, graphic artistry, content writing, marketing strategies, and UX, and we know how to implement their concepts and bring them to life. We know enough to know how to implement a good marketing strategy, but we are not the ones that will come up with it from scratch.\nThe last step for us was to define our Core Values. While we\u2019ve always lived by these values, we never actually stopped to take the time to really think about them and put them down on paper. It was a great experience to think about each of our team members and clearly define which qualities and characteristics stood out. We pretty much laid out the model of what we wanted all future employees to look like. So, these are the Core Values that our team lives and breathes:\nUpdate October 2021 \u2013 I\u2019ve recently realized two of our core values, whatever it takes and work hard, play hard, have picked up some negative connotations within the industry, so I wanted to clarify what these 20-year-old core values really mean to Team BizStream.\nWhat it may mean to other companies: At some companies, whatever it takes means literally doing whatever it takes to accomplish a task, complete a project, or land a big sale. This may mean working long hours at the expense of time with your friends and family, sacrificing your mental health, or doing things you\u2019re morally uncomfortable doing.\nWhat it means to BizStream: At BizStream, however, whatever it takes means going above and beyond for the good of the team because we are stronger when we work together than we are working with only our own interests or our own projects in mind. We don\u2019t want anyone getting left behind. It\u2019s not just at the employee level either. Whatever it takes means the owners take care of our employees, their families, and our communities. Leadership will do whatever it takes to ensure our team members have what they need to succeed \u2013 extra help on a project, a last-minute mental health day, maybe even an advanced HSA payment when unexpected medical issues arise. When we do whatever it takes for each other, we are a stronger unit. Whatever it takes also means that our clients are well taken care of. To us, it\u2019s not always about the bottom line. Yes, we are a business; we need to make money, but giving a little extra here and there is ok too, especially if it is impactful to our client.\nWhat it may mean to other companies: Your boss expects a 60-hour workweek out of you while they frequently head out of the office early. You have an extremely stressful deadline, but your leadership team is nowhere to be found and leaves you feeling unsupported. YOU work hard, while THEY play hard. Does that sound familiar to you?\nWhat it means to BizStream: At BizStream, work hard, play hard doesn\u2019t mean working long hours. Actually, if our managers see one of their team members consistently putting in more than 45 hours a week, they will meet with that team member to understand why and make a plan to them get back to their standard 40-42 hours. We make it a point to monitor hours for many reasons \u2013 One, we want our people to spend their non-working time with their friends and family and hobbies. Two, we want to avoid burnout and unneeded stress.\nNevertheless, we expect our team to put in a SOLID, productive 40 hours (not a half-assed 40); that\u2019s what work hard means at BizStream. We don\u2019t want our people spending 60 hours at work where 20 of those hours are unproductive. At BizStream, we take on challenging projects with tight timelines. So when our team is on the clock, it is GO TIME. The owners and the leadership team live and breathe a strong work ethic, and we expect the same from the rest of our team. We like to get stuff done. When our whole team is working hard, we are unstoppable and can accomplish anything, including having a fun environment. Our play hard time is just as important to us (a quick foosball match, organized social hours, office parties \u0026 outings, etc.) because it allows our team to decompress and get to know each other on a personal level. I believe our team works better when they are confident that everyone is pulling their weight; It also makes our playtime that much sweeter \u2013 because the team knows we all crushed it to make our fun times happen. Because of this, I believe working hard and playing hard go hand in hand.\nNow back to the original post\u2026\nShout out to a local dev shop in Grand Rapids, MI Atomic Object. While we have Care as one of our main core value, one of our sub-points of Care is \u201CGive a shit\u201D, which is one of AO\u2019s values that we\u2019ve always admired. We tried and tried to word it differently, but the statement \u201CGive a shit\u201D is just so perfect and true. AO is another company with great Core Values.\nI want to make it clear that although we\u2019re all following the same core values, this doesn\u2019t mean we lose our individuality. There is a ton (some would argue too much) of individuality at BizStream. We all have different backgrounds and ideas. But with all of us following the core values, we know we are a team, and we truly care about each person on our team and the work that we deliver to our clients. Having core values allows us to take a step back and ask ourselves if what we\u2019re doing is in line with the BizStream Core Values and Focus. Essentially, for the greater good of the company. If it\u2019s not, we need to re-think what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it. We can have very strong yet healthy discussions and still come up with great solutions because we are not afraid to say our viewpoint or disagree with someone else\u2019s. It\u2019s all good, as long as it\u2019s done in a positive and constructive way.\nIt has been an amazing experience to be a part of BizStream as we have begun to solidify the concept of \u201Cthis is who we are!\u201D The values have always been there, back to when BizStream was made up of only two people. Now we are integrating core values into every aspect of BizStream and using them to take BizStream to the next level. It takes the right kind of person to not only survive but also thrive at BizStream. Defining these core values will\u00A0do just that to keep BizStream a great place to work.\nOkay, so, if you are reading this blog post, and you are interested in working at BizStream, here is the part where I am going to try to scare some of you off.\nIf you are the type that wants to come to work, punch in their 40 hours, and never think about work during your off time, that is great \u2026 but you probably won\u2019t fit in well at BizStream. There are plenty of jobs out there where you can do that, just not here. Part of BizStream\u2019s DNA is to do Whatever it Takes, Work Hard and Play Hard, Be a Team and Care. So, that means, after-hours or on the weekends, we might be hanging out together doing something cool, or working out together at the local CrossFit gym, helping someone out at their house, or occasionally staying a little late at the office to get something done. You\u2019ll also find a lot of us doing community work or volunteering to teach kids how to code. But we\u2019re doing that because we care and because \u2026 we give a shit.If you follow our social media, you\u2019ve probably noticed that we have a ton of fun. Because we DO Play Hard here. From parties (while most other companies are working) to having mini coolers all throughout the office stocked with microbrews, to team backpacking trips, and a ton more. We have a lot of fun. But the flip side to that is when we are working, we work really hard. If you are the type that likes to go to work, and kind of pretend like you are working, do half social media, news, online shopping, chatting, whatever other non-working stuff and half kinda pretend you are working \u2026 you are going to stand out like a sore thumb and BizStream is going to be very uncomfortable for you.\nWe do this job because we love it. Those of us that are programmers love programming, we talk about at work on the clock and off the clock. We are always looking for the next new thing. Is every project in the building the most exciting thing in the world to work on? No. But do we make the best of it, and try to balance the fun, cool technologies with the older, legacy stuff? Yes. And it\u2019s not just our programmers. This mindset carries on throughout our QA, PM, Marketing, Sales, and IT teams.\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time recently re-visiting why BizStream was started in the first place and how to keep it that way. BizStream was and will always be a place where awesome people come to do kick-ass work, celebrate their accomplishments, and help others along the way. Not everyone is into that style of work, and that\u2019s okay. They just aren\u2019t for us, and hopefully, now we (BizStream) and the person interested in the job can realize that much sooner, saving everyone time and frustrations. The team members who are a great fit for BizStream now have everything laid out for them; core focus, niche, and core values. They can apply any or all of those ideas in their day-to-day to help them be the best they can be at BizStream, which helps BizStream be the best it can be.\nIf all the stuff above didn\u2019t scare you but got you excited, you might want to visit our careers page.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on? Let\u2019s chat!\nStay up to date on what BizStream is doing and keep in the loop on the latest in marketing \u0026 technology."}

In this blog post, I will share some valuable insights I gained as an intern at BizStream. Whether you\u2019re about to start your internship or are planning to pursue one in the future, the tips I\u2019ll be covering can help you make the most of your experience.\nEvery company has a different culture, so it\u2019s important to know what sort of culture you may be getting involved in. One way you can get a glimpse of that culture is by taking a look at their social media posts. It\u2019s not uncommon for companies to post fun things they do, but that is often just a small glimpse into the company. Another effective approach to gaining insight into a company\u2019s culture and other important details is to review its website. By exploring a company\u2019s website, you can gain valuable information on its values, work environment, dress code, and more. It\u2019s important to note that neglecting to visit a company\u2019s website before an interview or expressing interest in an internship may send the message that you haven\u2019t done your research and lack a genuine interest in the organization. Another effective way to get a feel for the company\u2019s culture is to participate in company events whenever possible. I fell in love with BizStream\u2019s unique culture through everyday experiences and events like our annual golf outing and camping trip.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that not every company is the same. By learning about the company\u2019s culture, interns can navigate their roles and interactions with colleagues more effectively, ultimately leading to a more successful internship experience.\nInternships are a learning experience. Companies invest in interns to help them gain valuable knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields. This is the time for you to explore the working world and see how it relates to your education and career expectations. Your internship may exceed your expectations or fall short, but the focus should be on learning. Most of your learning will occur through everyday tasks, but don\u2019t be afraid to ask your colleagues for recommendations on additional resources such as books, videos, or articles to expand your knowledge.\nAt BizStream, we embrace our core value of Foster Growth in Others, so our team is always willing to lend a helping hand. So when I encountered a challenge or needed assistance, I spoke up and asked for help. This proved extremely helpful for me both during my internship and now as a web developer.\nDuring your internship, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to work alongside professionals who have been in your field for years. These individuals have a wealth of knowledge and experience you can learn from. Take the initiative to learn from them by asking questions about their experiences and career paths. You may be surprised at the valuable insights they can provide.\nBy learning about their experiences, you can gain insight into the history of your field and what changes have occurred over the years. This knowledge can help you better understand the industry and its trends, which can be valuable as you progress in your own career.\nFinally, your co-workers may have insights and advice that can help you have the most positive experience during your internship. For example, they may be able to offer guidance on how to navigate challenges or how to make the most of your time in the company. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask for their opinions and recommendations\u2014their input can be extremely valuable.\nIn my experience, internships are relatively low-pressure situations. Although you will have some responsibilities and general expectations to fulfill, you can still enjoy yourself by finding ways to have fun with the tasks at hand. If you are passionate about the field, focus on learning as much as possible and finding enjoyment in your work. Looking back on your internship, you will likely find that it provided you with more benefits than you would have received from treating it solely as a class required for your degree.\nIn 2016, I enrolled in the BizStream Academy coding bootcamp, which proved to be a game-changer for me. Thanks to the skills I acquired through the program, I later secured an internship with BizStream in 2022, eventually leading to a full-time position in 2023. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in coding and based in West Michigan. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to gain valuable skills and potentially open doors to exciting career opportunities!\nWhile each intern\u2019s experience may be different, these useful tips can help you make the most of your time as an intern by acquiring valuable skills, enjoying your work, and cultivating a strong work ethic. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that your internship may lead to a job opportunity (as mine did), so it\u2019s crucial to maintain a balance between having fun and demonstrating a strong work ethic. By following these tips and staying committed to your goals, you can maximize your internship experience and set yourself up for success in your future career. So, go ahead and embrace your internship experience with confidence and enthusiasm!\nIf you\u2019re interested in an internship with BizStream, check out our Careers page!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"161","pageTitle":"WWAADAIGFJD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-working-at-a-digital-agency-is-great-for-junior-developers/","text":"Why Working at a Digital Agency is Great for Junior Developers\nAs a self-taught developer who transitioned from a career in healthcare, I know firsthand how challenging it is to be new to the tech industry. However, working for a digital agency like BizStream has provided me with numerous advantages and opportunities to grow as a developer. Since starting as an intern in October 2022, I have progressed to a junior developer and learned so much from working alongside a diverse team of experts. In this blog post, I\u2019ll explore some of the many benefits of working for a digital agency such as BizStream and how it can help new developers like myself gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals.\nOne major advantage of working for a digital agency like BizStream is the opportunity to work with a diverse team of experts with a wide range of skill sets. This allows new developers to expand their knowledge and experience in different areas of digital development, including branding, web design, web development, digital strategy, consulting, CMS platform selection, and more. No two projects are the same, and it is incredibly convenient for new developers to have access to a variety of experts within the agency to ask questions and get quick, detailed answers. Having immediate access decreases the amount of time spent muddling through projects and ensures that the work being produced is of high quality. It also helps to streamline communication with clients, as there is no need to send a chain of emails back and forth between the agency and an outside team. As a result, the agency can respond to clients quickly and efficiently, delivering projects on time and within budget.\nFurthermore, working with an agency allows new developers to experience a coordinated approach to online strategy. At BizStream, for example, the entire team assigned to each project is privy to the consulting, design, and spin-up processes. By doing this, expectations are shared early on, and there is minimal room for deviation. This approach ensures that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goals and is aware of the different pieces that make up the whole. It also helps new developers gain a deeper understanding of the impact of their work and the importance of collaboration across different teams.\nIn addition to the above, digital agency can provide new developers with the opportunity to work on a variety of projects for different clients. As a result, junior developers are able to build a diverse portfolio and develop their skills in different areas. Working on various projects also allows new developers to learn from experienced developers who can provide mentorship and guidance. This can help new developers improve their skills and develop professionally. Since joining the team at BizStream, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work on a range of diverse projects, including developing a website for a non-profit hospital system, updating an ecommerce site, building a water sample data reporting site, and will soon be working on an agricultural product and education site. As a junior developer, I am overjoyed by my expanding portfolio and know it is something that I would have struggled to achieve on my own and on this scale.\nAnother benefit of working for an agency is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. At BizStream, for example, new developers are constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, such as headless CMS, serverless architecture, and AI/machine learning. With that being the case, we are able to stay ahead of the curve and develop skills that are in high demand in the industry.\nWorking for digital agency can also provide new developers with opportunities for career growth and advancement. For example, at BizStream, new developers can take on increasing levels of responsibility as they gain experience and prove themselves capable. They can also move into different areas of the agency, such as project management or business development, if they have an interest in those areas.\nFinally, working for an agency can give new developers a sense of community and belonging. At BizStream, there is a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, with regular team-building events and opportunities for socializing outside of work. This helps new developers feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves and can help them build lasting relationships with their colleagues.\nWorking for a digital agency like BizStream can provide new developers with a wide range of benefits, including exposure to a diverse team of experts, a coordinated approach to online strategy, the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, mentorship, guidance from experienced developers, the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, opportunities for career growth, and a sense of community and belonging. These benefits can help new developers gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals while enjoying their job.\nView our Careers page for current open positions to take the first step towards joining our dynamic team!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Members used to see associations as the exclusive, trusted source of information and connection.\nNow, information is everywhere online. And it\u2019s never been easier to access sources that appear authoritative (we\u2019re looking at you, ChatGPT), but ultimately lack depth.\nThe good news? There\u2019s opportunity. If you can tell a clear, convincing story for why your association is worth the cost\u2014and support that story with a modern website\u2014you can rise above the noise.\nOnce again, your association will be seen as the go-to source for insights, experience, and leadership no other online source can match.\nAssociations leverage multiple channels to tell their story (both on and offline). But how often do you audit those channels to ensure your message is consistent, clear, and relevant to your audience? When was the last time you spoke at length with customers to understand what motivates them?\nIt\u2019s likely you need to revisit two core elements that comprise your brand story.\nInterviewing members helps you understand the value they derive from your organization and what trends are influencing their behavior.\nIf you collect the right insights, you\u2019ll have what you need to craft a brand story that identifies what they truly want and how your association can help get them there. That enables you to craft a compelling narrative where your member is the hero, and you are the trusted guide. If they want to overcome their challenges and ultimately realize a better version of themselves, then they need what only you can provide.\nThrough your persona development work, identify places on your website that really matter to your members and ensure the value proposition is strong.\nFor example, an association that offers certifications should describe how earning accreditation can boost a member\u2019s career. Or, if you\u2019re an organization with a social-driven mission, make it clear how your members can participate and drive your mission forward.\nOnce you have a solid grasp of your audience, develop a brand guide. This guide will serve as the source of truth for all team members to share a story that resonates with members in a consistent and clear way\u2014no matter the channel.\nIt\u2019s time to carry the brand guide\u2019s core messaging across your website and communication channels.\nRemember, stories must always move the reader forward. How does that happen from a brand perspective? Three components must be present: great user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and information architecture (IA).\nStart with detailed user journey mapping. This will help you create a sitemap that informs your navigation, making it clear and easy for users to find the information they are looking for.\nSurfacing content that\u2019s meaningful is another integral part of keeping visitors engaged. Fortunately, an AI tool such as Algolia Recommends, makes this easy by leveraging live site and user data to enable advanced search capabilities.\nChange is inevitable. How quickly and easily your systems adapt makes all the difference in managing your association\u2019s story.\nMany organizations use rigid content management systems (CMS) that slow down content updates and require frequent developer involvement.\nModern CMS solutions\u2014whether headless, hybrid, or modular\u2014offer greater flexibility, faster workflows, and intuitive editing experiences for non-technical users. They also integrate seamlessly with your existing tools, from member management systems to marketing platforms.\nAt BizStream, one of our specialties is helping organizations choose and implement the right CMS solution to meet their unique needs\u2014helping build a digital ecosystem that\u2019s agile, scalable, and ready for whatever comes next.\nBut building a modern digital experience isn\u2019t just about technology\u2014it\u2019s about telling a story that sets your association apart. Partnering with an experienced team like BizStream ensures your website not only works better, but also tells your story in a way that resonates.\nReady to rediscover the story that captivates your members?

On April 24, join Rob Bean of BizStream and Kelly Jan of Recite Me as they share practical strategies to help associations move beyond compliance and build websites that are truly inclusive.\nDate: Thursday, April 24thTime: 10:00\u201311:00 AM Mountain Time\nFor mission-driven organizations, accessibility isn\u2019t just about compliance with a standard or mandate. It\u2019s about creating an inclusive experience for all visitors. Additionally, inclusivity should go beyond simply meeting the letter of a mandate and instead look for ways to provide better access to information and resources for members and other stakeholders.\nNew technology can broaden accessibility support online by automatically providing language translation for the content on your website, including documents posted online. Furthermore, these technologies can also provide the ability for the site to read the information aloud to the visitor which is important for non-English speakers or for those with reading comprehension difficulty.\nBut even as your association works to bring your website into compliance with Federal and State accessibility mandates, you\u2019re likely learning about emerging litigation and lawmaking from state, federal, and global agencies that will continue to affect you.\nHow can you keep up, stay in compliance, and truly meet the needs of your site users?In this practical webinar, you\u2019ll learn where to start\u2014and how to develop a sustainable approach to accessibility governance for your website.\nRob specializes in helping associations build better website experiences through a thoughtful application of strategy, creativity, and technology. He has generated great results for organizations such as CSU College of Business, Investments \u0026 Wealth Institute, the National Society of Black Engineers, The American Society for Non-Destructive Testing, and Western Research Institute.\nKelly specializes in fostering inclusivity across digital platforms. With a keen understanding of the importance of accessibility, she assists organizations nationwide in creating digital environments that embrace diversity.

{"id":"165","pageTitle":"BVDWLPSYT","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/breadth-vs-depth-which-learning-path-should-you-take/","text":"Breadth vs. Depth: Which Learning Path Should You Take?\nAs a developer, continuous learning is more or less part of the job. Because our field is relatively new compared to the majority of other professions out there, the landscape of software development is always changing. It seems like every day, there\u2019s a new language or framework or a new tool that claims to improve your efficiency to the point that you can become the elusive \u201C10x developer\u201D (read more about that in our blog post, Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status).\nDue to this, it can be really difficult to keep up with the times if you\u2019re not making a conscious effort to grow your skills and knowledge in this space. As of writing this, I have nearly 9 years of professional development experience. So, even though I\u2019m not exactly a seasoned veteran yet, I do feel I have a pretty good grasp on what has and hasn\u2019t paid off for me when it comes to the learning efforts I\u2019ve put in outside of work, and I hope to share some of those learnings with you.\nAn obvious place to focus your learning efforts would be the same tech you use daily at whatever company you work for. Staying within the scope of what you work with on a regular basis provides a great way to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the types of things you use and run into frequently. This is especially valuable when starting out as a developer or transitioning to a new stack.On the flip side, sticking to only learning things you are already familiar with can limit your growth as a developer. Deepening your knowledge in a particular area is beneficial, but eventually, you\u2019ll start to hit a threshold where the time you\u2019re investing in learning more and more about it is less and less helpful. You basically run into a situation where you\u2019re getting diminishing returns on your time investment.\nA less obvious but very beneficial path would be learning things that you don\u2019t use that often (or at all) at your work. This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but there are a handful of benefits to looking outside your norm when it comes to learning on your own time.First, learning outside the scope of your daily work can be a great source of new and fresh ideas for tackling different scenarios that might come up from time to time. Whether that be a new language or something like a new approach to automated deployments, the things you learn along the way can influence your approach to the problems you face at work, even if you never plan to use the exact same technologies.Secondly, depending on how variable your work environment is, there\u2019s also the possibility that the things you\u2019ve learned on the side might become directly applicable to a project you end up taking on at work. This comes down to random chance, unfortunately, if you don\u2019t get much say in how your organization works, but if you have the ability to share your thoughts and ideas to change the direction of technology adoption, then this is a great way to test out new stuff and potentially get your organization to move to something new. (Disclaimer: just because something is new doesn\u2019t make it better)\nAs mentioned earlier, I wanted to share some of my own experiences to shed some light on this topic. Below are some recent examples of how my learnings outside the typical BizStream stack have paid off for me.\nSince BizStream has primarily been a .NET shop since its inception, pretty much every project I\u2019ve been on in the past has been hosted in a Windows environment. Whether that be On-Prem with IIS or in Azure App Services, that\u2019s the world I\u2019ve been most familiar with over the past seven years, and it\u2019s what I would default to when hosting my personal projects that I had built outside of work.\nHowever, a little while ago, when I started on my journey with Vim (read my previous blog post, Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim), I realized that Docker runs so much better on Linux. I really started to enjoy working with Linux-based systems. This led me to want to start using Docker on all my personal projects and host them on a Linux VM running Ubuntu.\nAll the experience that I was gaining from changing up my hosting approach wasn\u2019t being directly used at BizStream for quite some time; it was really just me having fun trying something new.\nBut recently, with .NET Core becoming increasingly widely used (especially for us now that we\u2019re doing Xperience by Kentico projects), our ongoing efforts to provide headless CMS options, and Next.js being a top contender for those types of projects, there\u2019s been a lot more opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge I\u2019ve built up in this area.\nA recent example of all of this coming in handy was when we needed to help get a site deployed to a Linux VM that didn\u2019t have any prior CI/CD setup, just a Dockerfile in the root of the repo and a docker-compose.yml file on the server. Hopefully, you can see where this is going\u2026\nI was able to help out due to the knowledge I had built up on my personal time. This made it so we didn\u2019t have to re-platform them over to another hosting solution, which would\u2019ve been a much bigger lift when they just needed a deployment to fix some issues on their site. I even got to use my Vim skills when we needed to make some small tweaks to the docker-compose.yml file as part of our changes.\nFor the entirety of my professional development career, my work has been with high-level languages like C# and Javascript, and the lowest-level language I\u2019ve ever worked with was a C\u002B\u002B class back in college. This past December I decided I would attempt to see how far I could get in the Advent of Code challenge\u00A0with all my solutions being written in C.I unfortunately didn\u2019t get to devote as much time to this as I had hoped, but I still managed to solve 8 problems (the first 4 days worth) using nothing but C.It took me quite a while to wrap my head around solving many of those problems with the limitations that come with a low-level language. I didn\u2019t realize how much I relied on things like dynamic length lists, Linq, and simple things like having an integer array as a parameter to a function (well, the last one is accomplished with pointers in C, but that\u2019s a whole other fun topic). I also had to be very explicit in my memory allocation, which isn\u2019t usually something I need to think about when writing C# or Javascript code.While I haven\u2019t needed to write C code at BizStream since then (and most likely never will), I did at least gain the experience of needing to find new ways to solve what are typically simple problems. When I\u2019d come back to these high-level languages after writing a handful of C, it got me thinking about ways to make my code more efficient by being a bit more aware of the space complexity of my code.\nAlthough I\u2019ve spent the majority of this blog post discussing why I think focusing on the tech you don\u2019t normally use in your daily work is more beneficial to your overall growth as a developer, I want to make it abundantly clear that I think anything you do outside your typical 9\u20135 work is awesome, and strongly believe it will help you to grow faster than those who don\u2019t put in the extra effort. Being a developer and staying on top of the ever-changing landscape can feel daunting at times, but hopefully, you went into this field and stuck with it because you enjoy the learning process, and continuously strive to be a better developer today than you were yesterday.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Revenue streams like events, education, and training are no longer guaranteed. Online engagement is fragmented. And organizations are realizing that outdated strategies and legacy technology are limiting their growth.\nIf you\u2019re an association, nonprofit, or higher education institution, you may be asking:\nHow can we re-engage members and grow our reach?\nHow do we deliver clear, compelling value?\nWhat steps do we take to modernize and stay competitive?\nLeading organizations are answering these questions by embracing two powerful trends:\nTelling a better story (strategic branding)\nBuilding a better website (technology modernization)\nTogether, these two strategies help organizations clarify their value, connect with key audiences, and fuel sustainable growth.\nIf your team needs help with digital strategy or website development, connect with us. BizStream has helped organizations like yours achieve measurable success through smart branding and modern technology solutions.\nEven a beautifully designed website can underperform if your messaging doesn\u2019t resonate. At the core of every successful digital experience is a story\u2014and that story needs to be rooted in value.\nTo tell a compelling story, you must first understand your audiences: their goals, frustrations, and how they make decisions. With this insight, you can shape messaging that reflects your organization\u2019s purpose and draws members in.\nUnfortunately, many organizations bury their most valuable messages or speak in ways that don\u2019t connect. When your audience can\u2019t quickly understand your impact, they lose interest\u2014or never engage in the first place.\nYou know your mission. But do your members and prospects?Persona-driven research helps you uncover what matters most to your audience\u2014so you can better communicate how your organization supports their needs.\nOnce you understand your audience\u2019s journey, you can craft content that educates, inspires, and drives action. Use those insights to:\nPosition your organization as a thought leader\nBuild content that deepens member engagement\nDevelop messaging that speaks to prospects\u2019 real challenges\nReinforce your unique value and purpose\nBetter content builds long-term loyalty and boosts conversions by aligning with what your audience actually wants.\nToday\u2019s website isn\u2019t just a marketing tool\u2014it\u2019s your organization\u2019s digital hub. Whether your focus is engagement, events, or education, a modern website experience is central to how you deliver value.\nHere are a few key ways to improve your site\u2019s performance while solving complex problems and reducing operational overhead:\nMembers expect intuitive, seamless experiences. But disconnected systems and clunky workflows often stand in the way.By taking an integrative approach\u2014one that connects your technology stack and aligns digital touchpoints\u2014you can streamline the experience and make it easier for users to take meaningful action.\nStaying competitive requires technology that\u2019s flexible, scalable, and fast. Member-based organizations are increasingly adopting:\nCloud-based infrastructure\nAPI-first architectures\nModernized CMS platforms\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance personalization and insights\nModern systems allow your teams to move faster, reduce technical debt, and deliver better results.\nAll-in-one platforms often overpromise and underdeliver. Instead, many organizations are turning to Best-of-Breed solutions\u2014tools that specialize in doing one thing exceptionally well.\nWith an API-first, modular approach, you can:\nAdapt quickly to change\nLower licensing costs\nMinimize risk\nLaunch new features faster\nAt BizStream, we specialize in helping organizations architect smart, modern tech stacks that balance performance and sustainability.\nNeed guidance on how to start?

A well-structured site makes content easier to manage, improves SEO, and enhances user experience.\nThat\u2019s where taxonomies come in.\nTaxonomies help organize and tag content so users can find what they need faster. Whether you\u2019re organizing blog posts or product categories, taxonomies make it easier.\nWith Xperience by Kentico, taxonomies received a major upgrade.

But just as important is understanding your customers: their roles, their pains, their business priorities and goals, their part in decision making\u2014and their distinct buying journeys.\nWhen you are in tune with your customers and prospects, you have the means to help them get over the pain of change and adopt the new opportunities your solutions offer. The most common reason your prospects say no is that change is painful or difficult. When you have detailed personas, you can create messaging to demonstrate how your product or service benefits them, how they can leverage your solutions to improve their situations and positively impact their companies.\nPersonas let you get into that prospect\u2019s shoes and ask, \u201CIf I put on NEW shoes, do my feet feel better? Can I run faster with greater efficiency? Can I perform at a higher level?\u201DImproving sales by changing the way you talk to your customers might also require your team to overcome the pain of change. But when you take the time to develop personas for all your different potential buyers\u2014and then apply those insights to all the tactics in your marketing strategy\u2014you\u2019re already a step closer to winning more sales.\nBuilding messaging around specific buyer personas\u2014and creating content to support them through each stage of their journey with you\u2014is central to the success of any marketing effort. Most marketers know this basic principle, but surprisingly few organizations build and use personas and messaging consistently or revisit them as a resource once they\u2019ve been developed.\nDetailed personas for all your customers create a foundation for accomplishing several core goals:\nIf you aren\u2019t sure where to begin your customer research, we recommend starting with the most direct routes.\nReaching out to customers you know are happy\u2014and a few that perhaps are less satisfied\u2014will help you answer questions such as:\nWhat is their industry?\nWhat is their role within their company?\nWhat are their daily responsibilities?\nWhat are their priorities?\nWhat prevents them from meeting those responsibilities and goals?\nWho do they report to?\nWho must they consult to make a buying decision?\nWhy do they need a solution like yours and how badly do they need it?\nHow exactly can your solution\u2019s unique value help them reach their goals or meet their obligations?\nWhat benefits will they gain from using your solution?\nWhat objections or concerns are they likely to have about your solution?\nFor the most current insights into what\u2019s going on with customers, reach out to your sales team. They spend their days talking to customers and prospects, so they have a wealth of information that you can use to create persona messaging. They can also help you better understand the specific benefits and features that generate the \u201Caha\u201D moments on a sales call.\nYour sales team can also fill in details about how customers move through the buyer journey:\nAre your ideal customers aware that a problem or need exists?\nAre they aware of the causes of the problem?\nDo they know that a solution exists?\nAre they aware of your product or service and that it provides a solution to the problem or need?\nWhat questions do they have about your solution?\nWhat is their view of your solution compared to options from your competitors?\nAre they aware of your successes for other customers?\nDo they understand how to use your product or service?\nAre they interested in learning more? If so, which products or features interest them most?\nAre they willing to talk with you? If not, are they willing to read, listen to, or watch more information?\nYou can\u2019t please everyone. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need to. The key to marketing success isn\u2019t just connecting with an audience, it\u2019s connecting with the right audience\u2014at the right time.\nUsing the answers to these questions, you can create persona messaging and use it to keep customers at the center of your content strategy. Refer to your messaging regularly to verify that everything you create, from websites to white papers, communicates the benefits of your solution when applied to your customers\u2019 real needs.\nIn conjunction with your persona messaging, an understanding of your ideal customer\u2019s buying journey can help you create a successful marketing and content strategy that improves organic search ranking, converts website visitors into qualified leads, and converts leads into sales.\nThe most important takeaway in all of this is to keep the customer at the center of everything your marketing team creates.\nDeveloping personas and mapping content to your customers\u2019 buyer journeys does take time. If bandwidth is tight, partnering with an agency team can provide a dedicated force to complete your messaging tasks.\nLook for an agency that can also help you determine\u2014\nAre you ready to transform the way you connect with customers?

{"id":"179","pageTitle":"EK1SIWAASSR","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/enhance-kentico-13-search-index-with-azure-ai-search-semantic-ranker/","text":"Enhance Kentico 13 Search Index with Azure AI Search Semantic Ranker\nAs with any technology, search has really come a long way, especially cloud services and integrating those services with your web application. In light of that, we are going to explore adding a basic Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index and how that can dramatically improve your users\u2019 search experience. Let\u2019s jump right in!\nFirst, let\u2019s break down what our tech stack looks like.\nWe should also cover some prerequisites to make sure you know where our starting point is, as this article will not be covering the below items:\nIn order to use Semantic ranker, you will need to install newer .NET Core packages to work with the correct objects.We have a class library project, ProjectName.KenticoIntegration. In this project, we are going to install the Azure.Search.Documents package. Chances are you may already have it, but it may need to be updated. Make sure to update it in all of the projects using it.\nLet\u2019s dig into some code, shall we? There is going to be some refactoring needed, but you are mostly going to be adding to your existing code.When using Azure as a search index, generally, you are going to customize the index process in some way so that you can add your own flavor of content to the index. To provide some context, in our case, we have the following:\nWe are hooking into several different events with our own custom methods. We will dive into those one by one, as we will need to know what they are doing when creating the methods for configuring the index with a semantic configuration.\nYou\u2019ll notice later that we have similar processes, but the objects used are from different packages. In the search index customization module, we are utilizing the Microsoft.Azure.Search packages, whereas in the helper class, we\u2019re going to be utilizing the newer Azure.Search.Documents package to aid in creating the semantic ranker. The helper is required specifically to handle the newer Semantic ranker features we will be implementing.\nWhen Kentico has to create and update the index, these search index objects have to match, meaning they both have to have the same configuration; otherwise you will run into errors such as the following:\n\u201CCreating or updating index \u2018index-name\u2019 failed with the following error: This index has suggesters defined in it that cannot be removed. This error is caused by attempting to update an index without including all of its existing suggesters or by attempting to update an index that was created/updated with a new version of the API.\u201D\nNow, let\u2019s get into the actual inner workings of the index creation process.\nOne thing we can do to make our lives a little easier and avoid repetitive code is create a DefaultSuggester class that inherits Suggester (from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models library). We can reuse this across multiple methods, which you will see later. But, for context, here is the class now:\nIn this method, we are setting up the fields that will have our desired attributes\u2014in our case, that\u2019s several filterable and facetable fields for our search page that is already implemented.\nThe first thing we do is validate the incoming CreateFieldEventArgs parameter, specifically the SearchIndex.IndexCodeName to verify it is indeed the correct index. We then configure our fields with their appropriate values based on our needs:\nIn this method, we add our fields as necessary, formatting values that require formatting as well.\nAnd for context, here is our AddField method:\nThis custom method ties everything together.\nThe method calls two more private methods (AddSuggester and AddSemanticConfiguration), one to set up the suggesters and the other to set up the semantic configuration.\nFor reference, one of the important things you have to do is make sure to reference the .NET Framework package here. Note the \u201CAzureSearchModels\u201D alias, which we have aliased from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models package. More on that momentarily. Let\u2019s take a look at the AddSemanticConfiguration:\nNotice we are using the fluent interface design pattern for chaining purposes. As noted above, we are doing all of this with the older package so that things are compatible with Kentico\u2019s process, but we need to extend this with our new class to utilize the new packages and semantic options. We will explore that in a moment in the next section, but first let\u2019s review some of what\u2019s going on with the configuration method above.In our configuration, the semantic title field is associated with the Title field of the node. The content fields for the semantic configuration were just the fields on the node that had a majority of the content that would be matched with a semantic search. We also didn\u2019t have any fields in our case that made sense for the Keywords fields.Another thing to keep in mind with semantic search is how it tokenizes the input and the limit on those tokens. Approximately 20,000 characters will max out the search, meaning if you have fields that are extremely long in your configuration, it could possibly eat up all of the available tokens. This is an important detail, so organizing the fields is crucial to ensure the most relevant fields are included in the search.\nIn our SearchIndexHelper class, located in our KenticoIntegration project, we instantiate a couple of private properties and our constructor. Note that the SearchIndex and the SearchIndexClient (and other objects) are both from the Azure.Search.Documents package. We also alias the older package so we can pass in the legacy field to the WithField method.\nWe use our search admin key and service name that were retrieved from the key vault and passed in to create our client. After the constructor, there are our chaining methods.\nThis is the method that we will call from the customization module code to integrate the two classes, integrating the Kentico CMS with the newer .NET Core packages necessary to work with Semantic ranker.\nAnd that is the overall concept of implementing Semantic ranker with your Kentico 13 search index within Azure. With this type of configuration, search results on your website will have a layer of semantic association. The biggest challenge I ran into was integrating the .NET Framework packages of Kentico with the new .NET Core packages. The indexes have to match definitions across both packages, including the suggesters. Adding Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index is a powerful enhancement, even with minimal configuration. If you are using a free search service, you will have to weigh the costs of creating a new Basic plan search service. However, if you are already paying for the Basic plan, it might be a no-brainer to enhance the user experience within your Kentico sites search.Happy coding!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"181","pageTitle":"SGFCAAASIIXBK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/simple-guide-for-creating-an-azure-ai-search-index-in-xperience-by-kentico/","text":"Simple Guide for Creating an Azure AI Search Index in Xperience by Kentico\nXperience by Kentico is the latest modern content management system that Kentico has released. It immediately stands out with its sleek, modern interface, fast navigation, and powerful features. One key feature is the ability to integrate with Azure AI Search. This post outlines the steps to configure a project for Azure AI Search integration and set up the Azure AI Search module in the admin to build a search index using content types defined in Xperience.\nBelow is what will be used to implement this feature:\nThe initial steps focus on configuring the project to make Azure AI Search accessible within the Xperience admin interface. This involves installing the Azure Search package for Xperience by Kentico, setting it up in the Program.cs file, and ensuring it\u2019s recognized in the Xperience admin.\nThere are a few ways to install the package:\nSuccess! The Azure AI Search package for Xperience by Kentico is now installed on the project.\nNext, open the Program.cs file and call the IServiceCollection extension method AddKenticoAzureSearch, passing it the ConfigurationManager. The line of code should look like this:\nThe project can now be run. Upon accessing the Xperience admin interface, a new module under Development titled \u201CAzure AI Search\u201D should now be visible.\nWith the program configured to access the Azure AI Search module, the next step is connecting the Azure AI Search service to the application.\nThese steps involve:\nBy the end of this process, the Azure AI Search service will be fully connected and ready to handle search queries within the application.\nIf a 500 error occurs when accessing the \u2018Azure AI Search\u2019 module, it is likely due to missing settings from the search service. To resolve this, right-click the project in Visual Studio and select \u2018Manage User Secrets.\u2019 Then, paste the following keys:\nIMPORTANT: The names of the keys must match exactly what they are named above.\nTo retrieve the values for these keys, consult the following settings in the Azure AI Search service:\nNote: If a query key does not already exist, be sure to create one by clicking the \u201CAdd\u201D button, entering a name, and clicking \u201CDone.\u201D This should automatically generate a key to be copied.\nAfter rebuilding the project, returning to the admin, and accessing the module, the error should no longer appear.\nThe next step involves developing a strategy for building the search index, ensuring that the fields of the content types are properly mapped. For this example, the NewsDetail and Homepage content types from my \u201CAzure Search Test\u201D Xperience channel will be used.Begin by adding two files to your project: one for the search model and one for the search strategy. In this example, those files will be named XperienceAzureExampleModel and XperienceAzureExampleStrategy, respectively.The model will inherit from the BaseAzureSearchModel that the Xperience Azure Search package provides.\nThe strategy will inherit from BaseAzureSearchIndexingStrategy\u003CTSearchModel\u003E provided by the Xperience Azure Search package, with the model created earlier used as the TSearchModel. Next, implement the MapToAzureSearchModelOrNull method. This method checks whether the incoming IIndexEventItemModel parameter matches one of the content types intended for inclusion in the search index. If a match is found, the relevant fields from the content type will be mapped to the corresponding fields in the TSearchModel, and the model will be returned.\nAfter implementing the strategy, return to the Program.cs file and update the previous line of code that was implemented earlier to look like this:\nWith the search strategy now successfully implemented, the next step is to configure the search index in the Xperience admin, preparing it for the indexing process. This will ensure everything is ready for building the index and integrating your search functionality seamlessly.\nTo begin this final step, navigate back to the Azure AI Search module in the Xperience admin. Click the \u201CCreate Index\u201D button, then follow these steps: enter the Included Path, select the Included content types (matching those from the search strategy), specify the Index Name, choose the Indexed Languages, select the Channel Name, and finally, choose the indexing strategy implemented earlier from the Indexing Strategy dropdown. Be sure to save the path and then save the index.\nIn the Azure AI Search module, the index can now be rebuilt by clicking the \u201CRebuild\u201D icon.\nReturning to the Azure AI Search service, navigate to Search Management\u003E Indexes. The index should now appear, matching the name specified in Xperience.\nThe contents of the index should now display only the content types included in the search strategy that have corresponding pages within the Xperience channel.\nBy following these steps, a fully functional integration between Xperience by Kentico and Azure AI Search has been established. The project configuration, search strategy implementation, and search index setup in the Xperience admin now allow content types to be indexed and searched efficiently. This integration not only enhances the search capabilities of the application but also demonstrates the flexibility and power of Xperience when paired with Azure AI Search. With everything in place, the application is ready to handle and optimize search queries, providing users with fast and relevant search results.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"182","pageTitle":"BT1DHYPTRS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/breaking-the-10x-developer-hype-your-path-to-rockstar-status/","text":"Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the term \u201C10x software engineer\u201D thrown around\u2014this mythical creature who is supposedly ten times more productive than their peers, able to churn out code faster, solve problems quicker, and deliver results with superhuman efficiency. Companies drool over the idea of finding a \u201C10x engineer,\u201D the one developer who can carry an entire team on their back. But here\u2019s the reality: the idealization of a 10x engineer as the end goal is a myth.\nBeing a great engineer isn\u2019t about raw output or cranking out ten times the amount of code. It\u2019s about solving problems in the most effective way possible, making smart decisions, and guiding others with well-informed recommendations. The engineers who make the biggest impact aren\u2019t the ones who write the most code\u2014they\u2019re the ones who can navigate complexity, communicate clearly, and steer projects in the right direction. If you can talk the talk and walk the walk, you\u2019re the real 10x software engineer. You\u2019re worth your weight in gold.\nEngineering is, at its core, problem-solving. It\u2019s not just about knowing the latest JavaScript framework or the newest cloud service. It\u2019s about understanding the problem, evaluating the available tools, and applying them effectively. With the sheer number of tools and technologies available today, the ability to sift through the noise and choose the right one is what separates the good engineers from the great ones.\nForget the \u201C10x software engineer\u201D nonsense. The real 10x skill is versatility\u2014being able to move between different technologies and domains with ease. It\u2019s about having a deep understanding of core principles and applying them across various scenarios. And here\u2019s the kicker: you don\u2019t need to know every tool. You just need to know enough to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.\nLet\u2019s get specific:\nReact is the go-to for most developers, but Svelte might be the better choice for projects where performance and simplicity are key. My recommendation? Stick with React if you\u2019re building something that requires a robust ecosystem and community support. But don\u2019t sleep on Svelte if you need something lightweight and performant.\nNode.js is great for asynchronous, real-time applications, while .NET Core shines in enterprise environments with heavy computational tasks. If you\u2019re working on a web API that needs to scale quickly, Node.js is a solid choice. But if you\u2019re dealing with enterprise-level data processing, .NET Core might be the better fit. My recommendation? Use Node.js for quick, scalable web services and .NET Core when you need to integrate deeply with Microsoft ecosystems. And PLEASE use TypeScript.\nBoth AWS and Azure offer a wide range of services, but they excel in different areas. AWS is known for its breadth and maturity, making it a great choice for startups and companies looking for a wide range of tools. Azure, on the other hand, integrates seamlessly with Microsoft products, making it ideal for enterprises. My recommendation? Choose AWS if you\u2019re building something from scratch and need a variety of tools. Opt for Azure if you\u2019re in a Microsoft-centric environment.\nOAuth2 is powerful for complex, multi-user environments, while JWT is great for simple, stateless authentication. If you\u2019re building a multi-tenant SaaS platform, OAuth2 is the way to go. For simpler applications with a need for secure, stateless authentication, JWT gets the job done. My recommendation? Use OAuth2 for complex, enterprise-grade applications and JWT for leaner, straightforward authentication needs.\nFigma is excellent for collaborative, web-based design work, while Adobe XD offers powerful offline capabilities and tight integration with other Adobe tools. My recommendation? Go with Figma for real-time collaboration and XD if you\u2019re already embedded in the Adobe ecosystem.\nLet\u2019s be clear: The idea of a 10x software engineer is a myth. It\u2019s not about output\u2014it\u2019s about making smart decisions. The best engineers aren\u2019t just cranking out code; they\u2019re making strategic choices that drive the project forward. And the most critical of these choices? Making solid recommendations.\nHere\u2019s one truth: Making a recommendation is one of the most valuable things you can do as an engineer. When you suggest a solution, you\u2019re not just offering an opinion\u2014you\u2019re providing a roadmap. If you can make strong, well-informed recommendations and back them up with confidence, you become indispensable. You\u2019re not just an engineer; you\u2019re a strategist.\nHere\u2019s a harder truth: The people who call the shots often don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019re not the ones deep in the code, dealing with the complexities of the tech stack or understanding the nuances of what needs to be done. It\u2019s important to communicate clearly when what they\u2019re asking for might require more time or resources to do right. A good boss will appreciate your expertise and trust your judgment. If they don\u2019t, it might be worth considering whether you\u2019re in the right environment.\nYou\u2019re tasked with building a high-performance web application. The client wants something snappy and efficient. Do you default to Node.js/React because it\u2019s popular and Joe Blow at work said we should use it all the time? Do you recommend Svelte because you believe it\u2019s more performant in this use case? Here\u2019s my take: If performance is the #1 priority, we need to think beyond JavaScript metaframe-works and focus on the architecture. First and foremost, we need server-side rendering, and there\u2019s hardly a more performant stack than C# ASP.NET Core with all of its caching capabilities and optimized memory management. If you\u2019re using C# and opting into cloud hosting, you\u2019re looking at Elastic Beanstalk or AWS App Services. Client-side, we want something that is lightweight to reduce bloat. If you can, go with vanilla JavaScript (with TypeScript for development, of course). At each step, the priority is reduction, caching, and minimizing client-server interactions.\nYou\u2019re dealing with a backend that\u2019s starting to creak under heavy data loads. Do you recommend scaling out with more servers, or do you take the time to refactor and optimize the existing code? My recommendation: This depends on the budget. Scaling out is definitely a quicker fix, especially if you\u2019re hosting in Azure or AWS, but it could burn a hole in your pocket if you\u2019re not careful. Optimizing data caching is the fix, as opposed to a band aid solution like scaling out.\nYou\u2019re building an authentication system for a consumer-facing app. Do you go all-in on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for maximum security, or do you recommend a simpler, frictionless OAuth2 flow that won\u2019t scare away users? My recommendation: Consider your user base. For a consumer app, prioritize a smooth user experience by implementing a simple OAuth2 flow, with MFA as an optional feature for those who want extra security. This approach minimizes friction, making it easy for users to sign in while still offering additional protection when needed. In contrast, for enterprise apps handling sensitive data, mandatory MFA is essential despite adding complexity, as the higher stakes require robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access.\nHere\u2019s the thing, if you can make strong, well-informed recommendations, you\u2019re worth your weight in gold. The best engineers don\u2019t just code\u2014they guide. They look at the bigger picture, make strategic choices, and confidently steer projects in the right direction. That\u2019s the real 10x skill: not writing ten times more code, but making ten times more impactful decisions.\nWhen you\u2019re making those decisions, you need to be ready to answer some key questions that will determine the success of any project. Here are a few you should have answers to if you want to be a formidable opponent in the tech space:\nAre you going with the tried and true, or is this a time to experiment with something new? What are the project\u2019s priorities: speed, budget maintenance, reliability, security, or something in between?\nAWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem, or somewhere else entirely? What\u2019s the cost, and what\u2019s the support like?\nBreak down the problem into smaller parts. Identify the risks involved for the task at hand. For example:\nBeing able to answer these questions confidently\u2014and making sure the people who call the shots understand the implications\u2014sets you apart as an engineer who\u2019s not just competent but invaluable.\nThe true power of a software engineer lies not in the quantity of their output but in the quality of their decisions. Specialize in solving complex problems, have a passion for what you do, and learn from your losses\u2014those \u201CL\u2019s\u201D are what make you better. Be versatile, be confident, use failure as a learning opportunity, and most importantly, be someone who makes strong, informed recommendations. That\u2019s how you become invaluable in an industry where change is the only constant. You\u2019re not just an engineer\u2014you\u2019re a problem solver, a guide, and a rockstar.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"183","pageTitle":"F.T.MAMWNB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/from-bak-to-bacpac-managing-azure-migrations-with-non-standard-backups/","text":"From .bak to .bacpac: Managing Azure Migrations with Non-Standard Backups\nWhen it comes to cloud migrations, not every scenario plays by the book. Our recent migration of a Kentico project to Azure was supposed to be straightforward\u2014until we were handed a .bak file instead of the expected .bacpac. This blog post unpacks the unique challenges we faced and provides a detailed walkthrough of our solution.\nNote: You might wonder why we didn\u2019t simply restore the database directly on our Azure server using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). It\u2019s important to understand that Azure SQL Server does not support restoring from a .bak file directly. Instead, Azure requires the use of .bacpac files for database imports. This distinction is crucial for planning migrations and requires alternative strategies when traditional backups are not feasible.\nBefore diving into the complexities of migration, it\u2019s crucial to understand the environment we\u2019re dealing with. One of the first hurdles we encountered involved identifying the SQL Server version of the .bak file provided, as mismatched versions between the source and target can complicate restorations.Typically, this information isn\u2019t accessible without restoring the database, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, there\u2019s a more efficient approach: using a SQL query to extract this information directly from the .bak file. By running the following SQL command, we can peek into the .bak file to retrieve essential details about the SQL Server environment without the need for a full restore:\nReplace \u2018C:\\PathToYourBackup\\YourBackupFile.bak\u2019 with the actual path to your .bak file. This query provides a snapshot of the database\u2019s metadata, including the version, which is instrumental in planning a smooth migration.\nOnce you have determined the SQL Server version of your .bak file, you may encounter scenarios where it is incompatible with all your available SQL Server versions. If this happens, consider the following options:\nIf your .bak file is compatible with your target SQL Server version, the next step is to restore the database. This process can seem daunting, but with the right commands and a careful approach, it can be executed smoothly. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you restore your database from a .bak file:\nThis process will transfer the data from the .bak file back into a live SQL Server environment, effectively recreating the original database structure and contents on your target server.\nDue to the substantial size of certain tables within our database, a direct export to a .bacpac file was not feasible, as it would routinely cause timeouts. To circumvent this issue, we opted to individually extract these large tables using the Bulk Copy Program (bcp). This method allows us to offload the data efficiently and handle it separately, which is crucial for managing the database size during migration.\nImportant: Before proceeding with the BCP process, ensure that any foreign key constraints related to these large tables have been properly handled. Refer to the \u201CHandling Foreign Key Constraints During Large Table Exports\u201D section further in this article for detailed instructions on how to drop and reapply these constraints to avoid complications during the migration process.\nFor example, to export a large table, you can use the following bcp command in an administrative command shell:\nNote: if Windows authentication isn\u2019t an option for connecting to SQL Server, use:\nReplace dbo.YourTableName with the name of your large table, \u003CYourFilePath\u003E\\\u003CFileName\u003E.dat with the path where you want to store the exported data, YourDatabaseName with the name of your database, and YourSQLServerInstance with your SQL Server instance name. By executing this command, the specified table\u2019s data is exported into a .dat file, effectively reducing the load and complexity involved in the main database export process. This technique not only simplifies the handling of large datasets but also ensures that all parts of the database are backed up with integrity and are ready for a smooth transition.\nWhen dealing with large tables that have foreign key constraints, there\u2019s an additional step to consider. Since foreign keys enforce relationships between tables, they can complicate the export process, especially when using bcp or excluding these tables from the .bacpac file. Here\u2019s how to manage this:\nIn our case, we were fortunate that our large tables didn\u2019t have any foreign key constraints, simplifying the process. However, this may not be the case for others, so it\u2019s important to prepare for this scenario.\nAfter handling the large tables with the bcp command, the next step in our migration process involves exporting the remainder of the database into a .bacpac file. This file format is ideal for Azure migrations but requires a careful approach when dealing with oversized data. Here\u2019s how to efficiently exclude the large tables during the export:\nBy strategically excluding large tables during the .bacpac export, we ensure the file remains manageable and tailored for Azure migration. This approach minimizes potential timeouts and errors associated with large database sizes, streamlining the migration process to Azure.\nOnce the .bacpac file has been successfully exported without the oversized tables, the next phase involves setting up your Azure SQL Database and integrating the large tables you managed separately. This two-step process ensures that all components of your original database are accurately recreated in the Azure environment. Here\u2019s how to complete this integration effectively:\nTo deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:\nTo deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:\nBy carefully setting up the Azure SQL Database and methodically integrating the large tables, you can ensure a complete and functional migration that mirrors your original database environment. This meticulous approach not only secures data integrity but also enhances the overall performance and scalability of your database in the cloud.\nIn conclusion, migrating a project to Azure involves more than just transferring data; it requires strategic planning and careful execution, especially when dealing with large databases. By employing methods such as using bcp for large tables and efficiently managing .bacpac imports, we can overcome the limitations posed by traditional migration methods. The steps outlined in this guide not only simplify the process but also ensure that every component of the database is accurately recreated in the Azure environment, maintaining integrity and performance. As cloud technologies continue to evolve, so too do our approaches to optimizing these migrations, enabling businesses to leverage the full potential of cloud computing.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"184","pageTitle":"UPBWCRIXBK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/using-page-builder-with-custom-routing-in-xperience-by-kentico/","text":"Using Page Builder With Custom Routing in Xperience by Kentico\nRecently, I was working on a project that I needed to implement status code pages that had page builder enabled on them. Since these were status code pages, I needed custom routing and could not use Content Tree routing provided by Xperience by Kentico. Once I enabled page builder for this content type and added editable areas to the view, I quickly realized I was missing something.\nWhen I ran the project and hit my newly created status code pages, I received the following error:\nWhen using custom routing, Xperience does not have context into which content tree page is connected to the custom route URL. Therefore, it cannot provide the page builder widgets associated with the page you are trying to reach.\nTo provide a little insight into the data behind the scenes: each web page item has a widget field where the page builder configuration is stored in. This can be found in the CMS_ContentItemCommonData database table, in the ContentItemCommonDataPageBuilderWidgets and ContentItemCommonDataPageTemplateConfiguration columns.\nIf Xperience doesn\u2019t know which web page is associated with the request, then it cannot render the corresponding widgets.\nWith the information from above in mind, we can infer that we need two things. We need to retrieve the web page item associated with the request, and the page context, or in other words, the data associated with that page (page builder widgets).\nWe will use the ContentItemQueryBuilder and GetWebPageResult to retrieve the web page item. In order to grab the correct web page item, we need to limit the results by the WebPageItemId. We can do this by getting the page context using the IWebPageDataContextRetriever. The code below shows how we can build the query to retrieve the page.\nWe are limiting the result to only the web page item whose WebPageItemID matches the page context WebPageItemID.\nThe final step in retrieving the web page item is the execution of the query using GetWebPageResult. If you want to read more about Xperience\u2019s Content item API and retrieving pages, you can reference their documentation here.\nFinally, we need to pass the context of the web page item to Xperience. This can be accomplished by using the IWebPageDataContextInitializer interface, which provides an Initialize method that takes a RoutedWebPage item as an argument. We can construct the RoutedWebPage object from the page data that we retrieved.\nTo wrap it up, integrating page builder with custom routing in Xperience may require some extra steps, but the process is straightforward once you understand the underlying mechanics. By manually retrieving the page data and initializing the context, you can get your custom-routed pages working seamlessly with the page builder. This approach not only resolves the context issue but also keeps your custom-routed pages flexible and fully integrated with Xperience\u2019s powerful content management features.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"186","pageTitle":"XBKCQU","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-content-querying-updates/","text":"Xperience by Kentico Content Querying Updates\nWith the release of Xperience by Kentico, the platform has experienced significant transformations aimed at enhancing flexibility and performance. This version introduces a range of new features and improvements, marking a clear shift from previous iterations. An aspect of these changes is the updates to the API, which now adopts a modular and service-oriented architecture. These updates are designed to provide developers with more efficient and powerful tools for managing content and integrating with third-party systems. The new API structure emphasizes flexibility, allowing for more precise queries and streamlined data operations, which improves developer experience and application performance.\nThe first notable change to Xperience by Kentico\u2019s API from previous iterations is the removal of the concept of a TreeNode. Previously, TreeNode was central to representing and managing the hierarchical structure of pages within the CMS, allowing developers to manipulate page data directly through a tree-like structure. The removal of this concept marks a significant shift in how content hierarchies are handled within the platform. The tree structure, while powerful, imposed certain limitations on scalability and performance, particularly as websites grew in complexity and size. By moving away from a tree-based model, Kentico aims to provide a more flexible and modular approach to content management that can better support modern web development needs.\nIn place of TreeNode, Xperience by Kentico now utilizes new APIs that separate content retrieval into two sets of objects: one for querying web page-specific content from a given channel called IWebPageFieldsSource and one for querying re-usable content from the new Content Hub called IContentItemFieldsSource. These interfaces make it easier and more efficient to retrieve and manage content.\nThe ContentItemQueryBuilder class is at the core of this new querying system. It allows developers to build detailed queries tailored to specific content types and retrieval needs. Paired with the IContentQueryExecutor, the API supports complex filtering, sorting, and data manipulation, making it easier to develop dynamic, content-rich applications. This new API structure enhances the developer experience by improving the ability to handle complex content scenarios with ease.Shown below is a depiction of the overall structure of a content item query.\nBelow are some examples of the new content item querying in action. We will walk through how to build and execute your queries efficiently, and some different query options you have at your disposal.\nTo start, you can build a simple query that retrieves all items of a specific content type. This is useful when you need to fetch a complete list of content items for display or processing.\nThen, you can apply subquery configuration and global parameters like sorting to the content items being queried.\nIf you need to filter content items based on tags within a specific taxonomy, this approach allows you to target content items that are associated with certain tags, making it easier to manage and display tagged content.\nAfter your query is built, it is time to execute the query. This is where IContentItemQueryExecutor comes in. Assuming that the IContentItemQueryExecutor is injected like so:\nWhen querying content items, you can execute the query and map the results to a model to handle the retrieved data efficiently. Here are two approaches using the IContentItemQueryExecutor.\nThis method maps the query results directly to a specified model:\nAlternatively, you can pass in a custom model binder to handle the mapping. This provides flexibility if you need custom mapping logic or additional processing during the binding.\nWhen you need to retrieve both web page-related data and content item-related data, the Xperience by Kentico API provides methods to execute these queries and map the results to your models. This is useful for scenarios where you want to handle data that includes both the content of a web page and additional metadata or settings associated with it.\nThe GetMappedWebPageResult\u003CTModel\u003E method is used to execute a query and map the results to a specified model type. It is similar to the GetMappedResult\u003CTModel\u003E function but also allows access to web page-related database columns.\nAlternatively, the GetWebPageResult method allows you to pass in a custom model binder. This provides flexibility for custom mapping logic, enabling you to process and transform the retrieved data as needed.\nBy using these methods, you can efficiently execute queries and handle the results, whether you\u2019re working with content item data, web page data, or both. The choice between using GetMappedResult/GetMappedWebPageResult and their counterparts with a model binder depends on your need for standard or custom mapping logic.\nThe updates to Xperience by Kentico represent a significant evolution in how developers can query and structure content within the platform. The shift from the traditional TreeNode structure to a more modular and flexible architecture, combined with the new querying capabilities, makes Xperience by Kentico a capable solution for modern web development needs.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"187","pageTitle":"TPOECIPM","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/the-power-of-effective-communication-in-project-management/","text":"The Power of Effective Communication in Project Management\n\u201CGenius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.\u201D \u2013 F. Scott Fitzgerald\nProject management and communications are inseparably linked.\nIn the world of project management, success is often determined by the effectiveness of communication. Picture this: you\u2019re leading a team on a complex project, juggling deadlines and client expectations. Suddenly, a critical team member is unsure about their role, and a key stakeholder feels out of the loop. The entire project starts to unravel. What could have prevented this chaos? The answer is clear communication.\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll explore how effective communication can significantly impact project management and share some real-world examples and practical tips for enhancing communication within your team.\nImagine you\u2019re building a house. The architect, builders, electricians, and plumbers must work together seamlessly. If the architect envisions a modern masterpiece while the builder thinks rustic cottage, the result will be a disaster. In project management, clear communication ensures that everyone involved is aligned with the project\u2019s goals and expectations.\nEffective communication fosters a collaborative environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and feedback.\nProjects always face unexpected challenges and changes. Consider the previous example of building a house, and imagine the project runs into geological issues. A project cannot be built successfully on a poor foundation (in this example, quite literally). If the project manager encouraged open communication, it would allow the team to quickly identify the problem and develop a new plan. This example illustrates the importance of communication in managing risks and changes.\nEffective communication is not just about internal team dynamics; it also involves engaging with stakeholders.\nI wouldn\u2019t mow my lawn with a pair of scissors, and I wouldn\u2019t cut my toast with a chainsaw. There always needs to be intentionality when choosing the right tool for the job. Similarly, utilizing the right communication tools can make or break a project. For instance, a remote team working across different time zones might rely on Slack for instant messaging, Zoom for video calls, and Asana for task management. Choosing the right tools for your team\u2019s needs ensures seamless communication.\nCreate an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns. Encourage open dialogue by actively listening and valuing input from all team members. During a change management project I was involved with, a simple suggestion box led to a wealth of new ideas and improvements, proving that sometimes the quietest voices have the most impactful contributions.\nRegular meetings help keep the team aligned and provide an opportunity to address any issues or questions. However, be mindful not to over-schedule meetings. Jeff Bezos famously adopted the \u201Ctwo pizza rule\u201D: never have a meeting where two pizzas wouldn\u2019t feed the group. Ensure each meeting has a clear purpose and agenda to avoid unnecessary gatherings.\nWhen communicating, aim to be as clear and concise as possible. Avoid jargon and complex language that may confuse team members or stakeholders. This is particularly important within the technology industry, where audience comprehension of complex concepts may be wildly varied, even within expert teams. This can also help avoid making assumptions.\nConstructive feedback is an essential component of effective communication. Provide regular feedback to team members, acknowledging their strengths and offering guidance on areas for improvement. This also means sharing and celebrating wins publicly, particularly on projects that operate within sprints, to keep up the team morale and momentum.\nEffective communication is the cornerstone of successful project management. By prioritizing clear and open communication, project managers can align goals, foster collaboration, manage risks, and engage stakeholders more effectively. As a result, projects are more likely to be completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved.Embrace the power of communication in your project management efforts, and watch as your team\u2019s productivity and success soar to new heights. Apply this wisdom to your projects, and success will surely follow.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"188","pageTitle":"CRCYATFTS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/communication-roles-changing-your-approach-to-fit-the-situation/","text":"Communication Roles: Changing Your Approach to Fit the Situation\nEffective communication is the backbone of successful project management. Nothing can build or break confidence more than the way we communicate, both with our clients and with our teams. Understanding and mastering various communication roles and knowing when to use which strategy, can enhance team collaboration and impact overall confidence. Here, we explore five key communication roles: the Expert, the Owner, the Guide, the Consultant, and the Facilitator.\nThe Expert role is crucial for moving projects forward with informed decisions. In this role, you provide your professional opinion backed by solid reasoning.\nFor example, if asked, \u201CWhy would you choose to build this website using NextJS?\u201D a succinct response might be:\u201CWe chose NextJS for its ability to provide server-side rendering, which improves page load times and enhances SEO. Additionally, its ease of integration with various APIs and extensive community support makes it a reliable choice for our web development needs.\u201DAs an Expert, your goal is to present well-founded, singular opinions that help drive the project in the right direction.\nThe Owner role is about providing clear, analytical updates without delving into storytelling. This style is particularly effective for status reports. Here\u2019s how to structure your communication as an Owner:\nState your objective: \u201COur objective is to complete the client\u2019s website redesign.\u201D\nProvide the current state: \u201CWe are currently on track to finish on time and have 70% of the designs completed.\u201D\nName the next steps or timetable: \u201CThe next milestone is the final design approval, which is scheduled for next Friday.\u201DBy focusing on these elements, you ensure that your communication is concise and informative, keeping everyone aligned on progress and next steps. This is a no-fluff approach. Leave the \u201Cwhy\u201D out of it.\nThe Guide role involves setting context and telling stories to provide clarity and direction. This is especially useful when dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks. For instance:\nState the situation: \u201CWe need to estimate these user stories before the sprint kickoff on Friday.\u201D\nState the complication: \u201CThere are still some unknowns on several user stories.\u201D\nResolution: \u201CCan the Business Analyst please work with the dev team and possibly the client to resolve these unknowns so we can complete the estimation?\u201D\nBy framing the situation this way, you help your team understand the broader context and the importance of resolving specific issues, thereby guiding them toward effective solutions. Where the Owner role avoids the use of \u201CWhy\u201D, the guide uses \u201CWhy\u201D or context to help explain the difficulties and nuance of a tough situation.\nIdeally, this is used outside of stand-ups, which are intended to be short and concise.\nThe Consultant role is about empowering others to take action, making it ideal for client interactions. When presenting options, avoid solving the problem outright. For example:State the situation: \u201COur sprint kickoff is at the end of the week, and we need to share our total estimate with the client.\u201DState the complication: \u201CThe estimated effort is higher than we estimated during the sales process.\u201D\nOption 1: \u201CWe can look for a less complicated solution.\u201D\nOption 2: \u201CWe could consider cutting out some less important features.\u201D\nOption 3: \u201CWe could look for additional budget if everything is needed and no changes are possible.\u201D\nIf asked, you can then provide your recommended resolution. This approach empowers clients and team members to weigh their options and make informed decisions. It leverages the expertise of all parties but gives room for personal opinions and overall collaboration.\nThe Facilitator role is essential for gaining buy-in from the wider team, especially when dealing with less appealing tasks. Consider this scenario:Situation: \u201CWe need to maintain legacy services for several of our clients.\u201DComplication: \u201CThese services run on an old server that we need to decommission, but moving them requires updating those existing services.\u201DAsk a question: \u201CHow do you think we should handle this situation?\u201DBy posing a question, you invite input and collaboration, which can be particularly effective in overcoming resistance and ensuring team commitment to necessary but less exciting tasks. This is also helpful when your role is identifying issues, but you personally lack the expertise on how to resolve the problem. It is similar to the consultative approach but is more hands-off in providing a solution.\nMastering these five communication roles\u2014Expert, Owner, Guide, Consultant, and Facilitator\u2014can greatly enhance the effectiveness of your communication within the scope of a project. Each role serves a specific purpose and, when used appropriately, can lead to better project outcomes, stronger team collaboration, and more satisfied stakeholders. Try some of these strategies out the next time you find yourself in a situation that requires a nuanced approach to communication.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"203","pageTitle":"BizStream Has a New Look","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/bizstream-has-a-new-look/","text":"BizStream Has a New Look\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since our founding. Our previous brand no longer fits our capabilities or our future ambitions. To better align our brand experience with the direction our agency is headed, a full rebrand was necessary.\nSince our inception, we\u2019ve always been a hardworking, knowledgeable technical development agency. We\u2019re now more than that. We\u2019ve brought design services in-house, our development team is continuously growing in number and expertise, and our product offering is more robust than it\u2019s ever been. The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.\nGenerally speaking, we wanted a brand that exuded more fun and excitement while also being professional. So, after reviewing our previous brand materials and a brand assessment by our leadership team, we dialed in on five key attributes we wanted our brand to be: Dynamic, Smart, Friendly, Vibrant, and Clean.\nFor inspiration, we looked at branding from all over, across all types of media. Making sure to look at other creative digital agencies; how they expressed their brand on their website, on social media, and in their marketing materials. We used all of this inspiration as a reference as we crafted our new brand\u2019s look and feel.\nOur previous logo\u2019s heart was in the right place, but the execution wasn\u2019t right for us anymore. For example, we liked the idea of the \u201CB\u201D and \u201CS\u201D combo in the icon, but the previous icon was visually busy, and the thin negative spaces didn\u2019t reproduce well at small sizes.\nAs we reworked the icon, we came upon a happy accident of a yin-yang shape in the middle, which was a fitting visual expression of our new design \u002B development service offering.\nThe font used in the previous wordmark was too thin when paired with the icon, and the serifs didn\u2019t fit stylistically very well. The weight of the new wordmark balances much better with the new icon, is much cleaner, and is more aesthetically aligned with our brand attributes.\nOur previous color palette used shades of the primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), which did not give our brand much uniqueness or individual style. In addition, during our review of the previous brand, we determined that almost all of the colors from the palette were used on every individual marketing item. This hurt the information hierarchy and made many of the items more visually complex than necessary.\nThe new color palette has more focus on creating a unique look and feel with color. Plus, it has a greater range of values to make more dynamic compositions. As well as vibrant secondary colors that can help add visual flair when needed.\nThe fonts used with our previous brand felt too industrial and clunky, especially when used in large headlines. The lines and curves of our new fonts have a more casual and friendly feel. Our new fonts also have a wider range of weights which allow for more design flexibility when creating branded items.\nThe last essential item needed for the rebrand was the development of graphic elements. Graphic elements are visual items or treatments that tie the brand together across various media. Similar to the logo, but much more varied, they create a visual connection from one brand experience to the next. Common graphic elements include: icons, illustrations, patterns, specific image cropping, etc.\nRedesigning every aspect of our brand helps visually establish the next chapter of our agency. We could have updated just some aspects of the brand and marketing materials, but it wouldn\u2019t have felt right for what we wanted to do. We want current and future clients to get a better feel for who we are and what we do simply by being exposed to our brand. A full rebrand was the only way to achieve that goal. We\u2019re the same great digital partner we\u2019ve always been, now with an updated look and a wider service offering.\nNot only did we design and implement our own rebrand. We also do this for our clients! If you\u2019d like us to help with your rebrand project, contact us.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

For more than 100 years, Trustmark has helped people and businesses thrive.\nKentico Xperience Site of the Month\nTrustmark needed to consolidate its existing business unit websites into one central, dynamic site. Previously, the business unit-specific sites (Voluntary Benefits, Health Benefits, Small Business Benefits, and HealthFitness) catered to different markets and business sizes.

Trustmark\u2019s goal was to ensure that the next iteration of the One Brand site provided consistent branding across all of its business units.\nWhile Trustmark had partnered with Bizstream on several Kentico projects in the past, this was by far the largest and most complex one to date. BizStream was able to translate the function and design requirements into manageable agile development sprints. The Trustmark Marketing and Web Development teams worked closely with the Bizstream team to refine the requirements and update components when needed. The modular nature of Kentico Page Builder allowed us to roll out features in sprints that enabled our internal stakeholders to develop content quickly and see immediate results.

{"id":"205","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/team/mark-schmidt","text":"Mark Schmidt\nOur motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.\nThe first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that\u2019s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU\u2019s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.\nAfter GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.\nWith a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That\u2019s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don\u2019t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That\u2019s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.\nAt BizStream, we\u2019ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it\u2019s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be clich\u00E9, but it\u2019s true \u2014 we work hard and we play hard.\nI\u2019ve found that if you\u2019re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, and I\u2019m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don\u2019t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don\u2019t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren\u2019t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.\nThe reason BizStream\u2019s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn\u2019t want to work at a typical job. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let\u2019s make it something we want to do.\nThis mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We\u2019ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).\nIn addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College\u2019s computer sciences department. It\u2019s really cool because I\u2019m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I\u2019m not at work, I\u2019m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I\u2019ve done a lot of home automation, and I\u2019m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.\nWork is such a big part of most everyone\u2019s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.\nThere\u2019s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: \u201CChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\u201D That\u2019s where it\u2019s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren\u2019t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nI joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn\u2019t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.\nThat same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.\nI went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).\nI was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.\nI like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nWe have a group of like-minded people here.

I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It\u2019s what I\u2019d do even if BizStream didn\u2019t exist. What we do at BizStream isn\u2019t easy, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00A0It\u2019s challenging, sure, but I couldn\u2019t be in a job that wasn\u2019t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.\nIt also makes me happy that we\u2019ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the\u00A0BizStream Academy\u00A0\u2014 a program where we offer development training for students \u2014 and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.\nI work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work,\u00A0which is one of the great things about BizStream \u2014 the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I\u2019m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.\nWhen I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),\u00A0 and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy.\u00A0I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico\u2019s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world.\u00A0When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.\nAs a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn\u2019t realize it, but I was learning what \u201Cwhatever it takes\u201D really means.\nI was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I\u2019ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world.

It provides guidance on how your brand should be presented across all channels, ensuring that your branding is consistent and aligned with your company\u2019s mission and goals. A well-crafted brand guide can help you maintain brand consistency, build brand recognition, and establish a unique identity in the market.\nA style guide, on the other hand, focuses on the visual aspects of your brand, including the use of colors, typography, imagery, and other design elements. It provides clear guidelines on how to use these elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing brand image. A style guide can help your team understand how to use your brand\u2019s visual elements consistently, reducing the risk of confusion or misrepresentation.\nAlthough brand guides and style guides can exist on their own, they\u2019re even more effective when combined together. Incorporating style guide sections within the overall brand guide creates a more robust, single source of assets and guidelines. Having well-documented brand and style guidelines creates a strong and consistent brand identity that resonates with your audience and helps you stand out from your competitors. By providing clear guidance on how to represent your brand, these combined guides save time and resources by streamlining the branding process and ensuring that all team members are aligned.\nDiscover how BizStream collaborated closely with the Woodpreneur team to establish a cohesive brand identity across various channels such as their brand, website, podcast, merchandise, and beyond.\nIt\u2019s not necessary to update your brand colors every year to keep up with the latest design trends, but incorporating a modern color palette can certainly have its advantages. Using contemporary color schemes can help your brand appear fresh, relevant, and appealing to a younger audience.In addition to colors, having a modern logo design can also make a significant impact on your brand image. A well-designed logo with a contemporary look can signal to your audience that your brand is up-to-date and keeping pace with the latest design trends. This can help you to stand out from your competitors and attract new customers.However, it\u2019s important to strike a balance between modernity and timelessness. A brand\u2019s visual identity should be distinctive and recognizable, not simply a reflection of current trends. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to work with a skilled designer who can create a visually compelling and timeless logo that also incorporates modern design elements.Incorporating modern design elements into your brand can enhance its appeal and help you connect with your audience. By striking a balance between modernity and timelessness, you can create a visual identity that represents your brand\u2019s values and resonates with your customers for years to come.\nSee how we brought new life to our outdated brand through a comprehensive rebrand that reflects our qualities of being Dynamic, Smart, Friendly, Vibrant, and Clean.\nConsistency is key when it comes to branding across all your digital and non-digital platforms.

{"id":"216","pageTitle":"WEDSLV","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-every-developer-should-learn-vim","text":"Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim\nNote: when I\u2019m referring to Vim in this blog post, I\u2019m referring to Vim Motions, not Vim the editor. Vim Motions can be enabled in most integrated development environments (IDEs) and would allow you to gain the benefits of Vim Motions without having to change your IDE. Learning the motions alone is hard enough, so don\u2019t try to learn a new editor simultaneously (unless, of course, you really want to).\nYup, that\u2019s me. You\u2019re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation\u2026\nIt all started just a few months ago when I randomly came across an old recording of a live stream by @realGeorgeHotz where he was writing a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) program, and I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly he was writing code and moving through his editor. At that point in time, I had no clue he was using Vim, but it made me realize that I\u2019m pretty slow in comparison, and I\u2019d love to be at that level of speed someday when writing code.\nThe exact timeline is a bit hazy, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than a week later that I started getting videos by @ThePrimeagen\u00A0recommended to me on YouTube, who also seemed to just effortlessly fly through his code and editor. At this point, I knew something was up and came to the realization that these guys knew something I didn\u2019t. After just a few more days of casual viewing, I finally stumbled across a video where @ThePrimeagen started raving about Vim and how effortless and fast text editing becomes once you take the time to learn it.\nThat was the secret sauce I couldn\u2019t put my finger on, and I was immediately torn. Do I learn Vim, or do I avoid it like the plague? I\u2019ve previously had coworkers on both sides of the Vim discussion; those who used it and swore by it and those who thought there was no way doing everything via your keyboard could possibly compete with the speed and efficiency of using a mouse in an editor, myself included. I went back to the original SLAM video I had watched, and sure enough, George was absolutely using Vim. It was at this moment that I realized I only had one path forward; to buckle down and get ready for the journey of learning Vim.\nAs much as I wish I could say, \u201CAfter an hour or so, you\u2019ll be up to speed and cruising along at the same pace as with a mouse, and after a full day, you\u2019ll be flying around your editor like @ThePrimeagen and @realGeorgeHotz,\u201D that\u2019s about as far from reality as you can get.\nLearning Vim is a process, and that process takes weeks of dedicated time (or months of dabbling) just to get up to the same speed as with a mouse. It\u2019s probably one of the steepest learning curves of anything I\u2019ve ever learned, but the payoff of learning it is extremely valuable, in my opinion.\nThe main reason for the extremely slow process of learning Vim is down to the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to go through just to move the cursor where you want it, copy text, paste text, etc., and it takes an extremely long time for those common actions to feel remotely close to muscle memory. I\u2019ve been on this learning journey for nearly four months as of writing this, and to this day, I\u2019m still having to recite the actions I want to take in my head as I\u2019m performing them.\n\u201CAlright, down four lines, (4j), yank the line (yy), up 16 lines (16k), select the current line (V), paste over it (p).\u201D\nI look forward to the day when all of that becomes second nature because that\u2019s when I\u2019ll really start to fly with Vim.\nAnother challenge of learning Vim (which also happens to draw some parallels to learning development) is the seemingly endless methods of accomplishing whatever it is you\u2019re attempting to do.\nLet\u2019s say you want to change the parameters of the TryParse method in the example below with your cursor starting at the beginning of the line:\nIf you\u2019re new to Vim and don\u2019t know many of the advanced motions yet, your initial thought would probably be to repeatedly press \u2018w\u2019 until you\u2019re at the start of the word \u2018role\u2019, enter visual mode with \u2018v\u2019, repeatedly press \u2018e\u2019 until you\u2019re at the end of the word \u2018roleId\u2019, press \u2018d\u2019 to delete what\u2019s currently selected, then press \u2018i\u2019 to enter insert mode and start typing the replacement.\nIf that sounds like a lot, that\u2019s because it is\u2026 and that approach is guaranteed to be slower than just using your mouse to make the same selection, press backspace, and then start typing the replacement. But when you\u2019re first starting out, that\u2019s all you know, so that\u2019s really your only option as you don\u2019t yet know a better way to approach it. (which is totally okay! You need to learn the basics before you start learning the more advanced stuff. You must learn to crawl before you can walk.)\nWith my current knowledge of Vim, if I were trying to do the same, I would first press \u2018f\u2019, followed by \u2018(\u2018, which would find the first \u2018(\u2018 in the line. I\u2019d then press \u2018;\u2019 to go to the next instance of that character, this time landing on the opening parenthesis of the TryParse method call. I\u2019d then use \u2018ci(\u2018 to \u201Cchange inside the parentheses\u201D. This removes the text within the parenthesis I\u2019m currently on (or in between) and puts me into insert mode immediately.\nThat approach is much better and is just as fast, if not faster, than trying to do the same with clicking and dragging with my mouse. In this specific case, I could likely be even faster by finding the \u2018,\u2019 character as that\u2019s faster than finding the first \u2018(\u2018 and having to navigate to the next one. So, with that improved approach, the full combination of keys would end up being \u2018f,ci(\u2018, which takes no time at all to execute.\nThe best advice I can give with regard to the difference in approaches above is to try not to get tripped up on finding the absolute optimal approach, especially when you\u2019re first learning. Be okay with a non-optimal approach that takes more time because you have to learn the basics no matter what. As time goes on and you get more comfortable with Vim, you can start looking into alternative approaches to performing certain actions. I find myself constantly doing things a certain way, then all of a sudden coming to the realization that there\u2019s a better way to do whatever it was I just did. I\u2019ll quickly undo my edits (using the \u2018u\u2019 key) and try the alternative approach I just thought of. If it feels better, I make a mental note to try and use that approach in the future when trying to accomplish that same thing again or something similar to it.\nIf you\u2019d like to know where I learned most of what I know up until now, I heavily leaned on this playlist on YouTube by @ThePrimeagen.\nI know there\u2019s been a few nuggets of information that point to some of the benefits of Vim in the section above, but I\u2019d like to do a deeper dive into some of them and also share some additional benefits I haven\u2019t covered yet.\nThis benefit has already been touched on above, but I still believe it\u2019s worth calling out in this section since it is definitely the main benefit of learning Vim. Anything that can make you a faster developer should be a no-brainer. As previously mentioned, you will be much slower when you first start. This is the most painful part of learning Vim, but once you\u2019re equally as fast with Vim as you are with a mouse, you will have crossed the threshold of gaining all the additional benefits outlined below with the additional upside of having the ability to continually get faster and faster as time goes on.\nThis may seem like a strange benefit, but switching between your keyboard and mouse less frequently can have a large impact on reducing your risk of developing an RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). Every time you have to move your hand from your keyboard to your mouse, you\u2019re putting strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The more times in a day you\u2019re performing this action, the higher your risk for RSI\u2019s.\nIf you\u2019re still using your existing IDE when learning Vim, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll still be using your mouse to navigate within your IDE. But reducing the risk of RSI\u2019s can be further enhanced by switching to a Vim-based editor (see \u201CAdoption of \u2018better\u2019 IDE\u2019s\u201D below)\nThis might be a bit more of a niche benefit, but this was definitely a big one for me. As someone who works on a Windows machine at work and has a macOS machine at home for personal projects, I would constantly get tripped up on Ctrl vs. Command when copying/pasting and all the differences in cursor movement between the two operating systems (Ctrl \u002B arrows in Windows are the same as Option \u002B arrows in macOS when moving the cursor in text files).\nAll this mental overhead went away once I was using Vim on both machines. Need to copy text? Just use \u2018y\u2019. Need to paste? Just use \u2018p\u2019. Need to undo? Just use \u2018u\u2019. Need to move the cursor word by word? Just use \u2018w\u2019.\nYou could make the argument that I just traded the mental overhead of switching between systems for the overhead of using Vim, but the beauty of Vim is that once it\u2019s learned, the mental overhead disappears. If I had stuck with my old approach, the mental overhead would still exist every time I switch systems until the end of time.\nAnother small but still impactful benefit that fits within the portability benefit is the ability to edit things like config files directly on servers that you\u2019re accessing via SSH. With Vim, you can quickly navigate and edit files when working in a GUI-less environment.\nThis section is extremely subjective since the best IDE for you is always going to be the one you\u2019re most comfortable using, but there\u2019s no harm in stepping outside your comfort zone and seeing what else might be available to you.\nIf I had to guess, most developers reading this are using VS Code as it has more or less become the industry standard for web development due to its extensibility afforded by their extension ecosystem. I, too, still use VS Code when writing code on Windows machines, as the Vim extension does a great job of giving me 90% of what I\u2019m looking for. The remaining 10% is down to limitations I\u2019ve found when it comes to navigating the IDE itself (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible to fix most, if not all, of the limitations I\u2019ve experienced, but I haven\u2019t taken the time to figure out how yet).\nIf you\u2019re someone who loves tinkering and wants to really dive deep into making an IDE that\u2019s tailored to your specific wants and desires, I\u2019d recommend looking into NeoVim. I\u2019d also recommend holding off until you\u2019ve got the basics of Vim down before doing so. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be trying to learn two things simultaneously, adding additional complexity.\nI ended up making my own NeoVim configuration based on a handful of tutorials I watched on the topic, and I\u2019ve found I much prefer working in my custom IDE than I do working in VS Code, but it could also be down to some additional tooling that I use that isn\u2019t available on Windows. My current setup on my personal macOS machine consists of using my custom NeoVim editor in conjunction with tmux, which is a terminal multiplexer. This allows me to easily switch between multiple instances of NeoVim, all individually configured for the needs of each project. This makes it super easy to jump between projects and pick up wherever I had last left off and also allows each project to be set up exactly how I like it. I even have some tmux plugins set up to handle saving the state of my sessions so that after a system reboot, all my sessions are exactly how they were before the restart.\nIt\u2019s also super easy to \u201Cpackage up\u201D your configuration, so it\u2019s super fast and easy to get spun up on a new machine. In my case, my tmux and NeoVim configuration files are in a repository on my GitHub, so whenever I set up a new machine, I just install NeoVim and tmux, clone my repo, create symlinks to the root of my user for the tmux and NeoVim configuration files and directories, and I\u2019m good to go. Everything is set up exactly how I previously had it, and it took less than a few minutes. It also allows me to make updates on any of my machines, push those changes to my repo, and then pull those changes on any other machines. Because of the symlinks, those changes are applied to my system as soon as I perform a pull operation.\nThe biggest benefit of NeoVim and tmux, in my opinion, is that I\u2019m able to navigate every aspect of my editor via my keyboard. This makes my development experience a dream, as all my coding can take place without ever needing to move my hands off my keyboard. It also makes it really enjoyable to work on just my laptop when I\u2019m on the go, as I don\u2019t need to constantly reach for the trackpad when navigating my IDE.\nMy hope is that this blog post has at least made you consider trying out Vim at some point, even if you\u2019ve previously sworn off the idea of ever giving it a chance. I was in that position not too long ago, and I can tell you from experience that as long as you stick with it and give it a fair chance, you might be surprised at how beneficial it is to learn Vim. While the path to mastering Vim may seem daunting, the endless possibilities it offers in terms of speed, health benefits, and adaptability make it a skill worth acquiring.

{"id":"230","pageTitle":"GRTFFSACAT","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/generating-realistic-test-files-for-secure-and-comprehensive-application-testing/","text":"Generating Realistic Test Files for Secure and Comprehensive Application Testing\nIn software development, generating test files is essential for various scenarios, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Creating realistic test data that mimics production data allows developers to thoroughly test and debug their applications in a controlled environment while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.\nI have been working on the YouthCenter application by BizStream for a while. YouthCenter is a comprehensive juvenile case management system used by organizations such as juvenile probation, courts, and detention centers. Recently, I needed to implement a feature to facilitate file migration within the application. Using live production data was not an option due to the risk of exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data protected under regulations like HIPAA. Instead, I generated a variety of documents, including Word files, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, and images. This approach allowed me to test the application effectively without compromising real data, providing a reliable testing ground that closely resembled real-world usage.\nOne of the main advantages of using generated test files is the ability to create realistic data sets that closely mimic real-world scenarios without exposing sensitive information. This ensures comprehensive testing of various application functionalities, such as file processing, uploads, and migrations, under conditions that reflect actual usage. It helps identify and fix potential issues that may only surface with large and varied data sets. Moreover, generating diverse file types and structures ensures that the application can handle different data formats and edge cases effectively. This method also supports performance testing by simulating high data loads, helping optimize the application\u2019s performance and scalability. Ultimately, it enhances the reliability and robustness of the application, ensuring it performs well in production environments.\nFor the example below, the file generator will generate as many files as the user needs. File names and the content of the files are all generated. My personal preference is Bacon Ipsum, but the generation call can be modified to call any Ipsum service you would like.\nTo effectively generate various types of files for testing purposes, our code is organized into several key components:\nThis modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.\nThe base class, FileGenerator, provides common functionality for all file generators, such as generating random text and images. It also defines an abstract method Generate that each specific file generator must implement. This file requires the RestSharp package to make HTTP requests and Bogus for generating random data.\nThe FileGenerator class is an abstract base class that provides methods for generating random text and images. It includes an abstract method, Generate, that each derived class must implement. The GetBaconIpsumTextAsync method fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API using RestSharp, while the GetRandomImage method generates a random image with specified dimensions. The GetRandomFileName method uses the Bogus library to generate random file names.\nFile Path: Generators/FileGenerator.cs\nThis modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.\nThe DocxGenerator class is responsible for generating Word documents. It uses the DocX library to create and manipulate Word documents. The class inherits from FileGenerator and implements the Generate method, which creates a new Word document, inserts random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API, and saves the document to the specified path.File Path: Generators/DocxGenerator.cs\nThe XlsxGenerator class handles generating Excel spreadsheets using the ClosedXML library. It follows the same pattern as the DocxGenerator class, fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API and populating the Excel sheet with random words. The class ensures that the generated file is saved correctly to the specified path.\nFile Path: Generators/XlsxGenerator.cs\nThe CsvGenerator class generates CSV files by fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, splitting it into words, and organizing it into a grid format. This class ensures the generated CSV files contain varied and realistic data, making them suitable for testing. I did not do any handling for commas in the Ipsum data returned, so data in the CSV files could potentially be misaligned. This was acceptable for my testing purposes, but can be handled within this generator if needed.\nFile Path: Generators/CsvGenerator.cs\nThe TxtGenerator class creates plain text files filled with random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API. This class ensures the generated text files are populated with realistic content, aiding in comprehensive testing.\nFile Path: Generators/TxtGenerator.cs\nThe PdfGenerator class handles generating PDF files using the PdfSharp library. It fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, breaks it into lines that fit within the page width, and adds new pages as needed to accommodate the text. This class ensures that the generated PDFs are filled with realistic, multi-page content.\nFile Path: Generators/PdfGenerator.cs\nThe FolderPathGenerator class is responsible for generating random folder paths and ensuring they exist. This utility class helps manage the organization of generated files by creating new directories and keeping track of existing ones. This class ensures that each file generated can be placed in a randomly chosen folder, either new or pre-existing.\nFile Path: Utilities/FolderPathGenerator.cs\nThe ImageGenerator class is responsible for generating image files. It uses the .NET System.Drawing library to create images with random colors. This generator is useful for creating test image files that can be used to simulate image uploads and processing in applications. The images generated by this code may not be anything stunning (solid canvas in a random RGB color), but the files have proper formatting to be able to be opened in an image viewing application.File Path: Generators/ImageGenerator.cs\nThe main program of the application serves as the entry point and coordinates the entire file generation process. It begins by setting the root path for file generation to the user\u2019s desktop and prompts the user for the number of files to generate. The program then initializes an array of file generators, each capable of creating a specific type of file, such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images.\nIn a loop that runs for the specified number of files, the program randomly decides whether to create a new folder or use an existing one for each file. It selects a random file generator from the array and generates a file with a random name and appropriate extension in the chosen directory. The program ensures asynchronous operations complete before proceeding, providing an efficient and organized way to generate a diverse set of test files. This setup simulates real-world file handling scenarios, enhancing the robustness and comprehensiveness of application testing.File Path: Program.cs\nCreating an application to generate various types of test files (such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images) ensures that developers can produce realistic and diverse data sets without using sensitive production data. This process is particularly useful for testing features like file processing, uploads, and migrations, allowing for comprehensive testing while maintaining data privacy and security. The application is organized into key components: a base file generator class, specific file generators for each file type, and utility classes. The main program coordinates the file generation process by prompting the user for the number of files to generate and leveraging these file generators to create content. By dynamically deciding whether to create new directories or use existing ones, the program effectively simulates real-world file organization. This setup enhances testing reliability, helping developers identify and fix potential issues, ultimately improving the application\u2019s robustness and performance in production environments.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"231","pageTitle":"TBIP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/the-bizstream-internship-program/","text":"The BizStream Internship Program\nAre you interested in applying for an internship at BizStream, or are you looking for inspiration to develop your own successful program?\nRegardless of your needs, I think you\u2019ll find some valuable insights here to help you either take part in or run your own internship program. Today, I\u2019m excited to share the ins and outs of the internship process here at BizStream.\nMy goal is to give you a peek into the inner workings of our tried and true process for hiring and working alongside interns. If you\u2019re considering applying for one of our internship positions, I hope to provide all the preparation you need to make that decision with confidence. We\u2019ve learned a lot over the years, and I hope our experiences can help you avoid some of the pitfalls we\u2019ve encountered.\nIt\u2019s very important that we discuss what an intern is and is not at BizStream.\nAn intern is not:\nAn intern is:\nThere are a lot of internships out there. We get it. It can be overwhelming to sift through thousands of opportunities only to find a job listing at a \u201Crespectable company\u201D where you\u2019ll be stuck doing grunt work for the next 90 days. You end up walking out, having learned nothing except how to efficiently place orders at Starbucks. Been there. No thanks.\nAt BizStream, we believe it\u2019s our responsibility to lead and foster growth in the next generation\u2014the future builders of cool things that make a worldly impact. That\u2019s why landing an internship here is so challenging. We have incredibly high standards and expectations. But don\u2019t let that discourage you. You\u2019ve read this far, so why not keep going?\nThe first thing we ask is for anyone interested in applying for our internship program to go to bizstream.com/careers/internships. From that page, scroll to the bottom and see if there is an open position for an internship within your line of profession. As of writing this, we have one developer internship slot currently open. If you select \u201CLearn More\u201D you will be taken to a detail page describing the internship position. If you want to apply, simply select \u201CApply to Position\u201D.\nWe also have an \u201CInternship Availability\u201D graphic on that page which can help those seeking a specific date/time for their internship to know if we have any availability.\nOnce the internship form has been submitted and the candidate has uploaded the typical requests (resume, portfolio link, LinkedIn) via our form, our team gathers the applications and does a first-round vetting.\nThis first round of vetting is to check for things like:\nIf a potential candidate passes the initial vetting phase, we move on to the phone interview, typically a 30-minute conversation. The goal is to get the individual relaxed and talking about their passions. We want to know what they hope to gain from this internship and assess whether BizStream is the right place for them to achieve those goals.\nNote: It is crucial that expectations are set and as clear and concise as possible. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the duration, timeline, compensation, and any other school-related requirements (if any).\nIf the candidate makes it past the phone interview, that\u2019s when the real fun begins. Specific to our development interns, our team has crafted a unique and engaging set of tests using coderpad.io to give us a baseline of the applicant\u2019s skill set. This forms the foundation for how we craft their experience at BizStream. Not to worry, though! The whole test takes roughly 2\u20134 hours, depending on experience level.\nI mentioned above that our internships are a notch above the rest. We don\u2019t hire on grunts. We hire passionate individuals who want to gain a high level of experience from industry professionals. I know it sounds cliche, but you would not believe how many places get this wrong.\nBefore I get into the details, it\u2019s important to understand that no two internships are identical. We offer marketing, design, and development internship positions, and each intern comes with a certain level of experience, which dictates how far down the path they will travel.\nOn day one, our interns get a crash course in the \u201CLife at BizStream\u201D\u00A0 and a team lunch to get to know their team members. We then assign each intern a mentor for the duration of their internship. Our goal is to ensure our interns are never forgotten and feel fully integrated into our teams. They attend all of our team standups, are reviewed by their peers as an operating member of the team, and are required to show up within our designated work times.\nWe curate an internship experience to be unique to the individual. For example, our most recent intern was a developer on Team Tangerine. Her first 30 days included a lot of reading from some of our favorite books (Add links to starting books), as well as solutioning, architecting, and building out her own personal project.\nIf the individual crushes their personal project, their mentor may decide to transition them into working on a BizStream internal project. These projects are designed to bring significant ROI to the greater BizStream team. For a developer internship, it could be an application that automates building out SOWs, a better tracking system for our daily goals, or even a potential product we plan to ship. For marketing, maybe it\u2019s a re-design of one of our existing websites or updating content in our space to bring it up to brand. Regardless, it\u2019s a tremendous opportunity.\nCertain interns may even get a chance to move into billable client work. This is where the rubber meets the road in terms of skill set and actual application; dealing with real-world requirements and deadlines.\nAt the end of the 90 days, we review the intern\u2019s time with us via 360 feedback. Our team spends at least an hour doing a deep dive into their work output and overall experience. And let\u2019s not forget, we send them off with a fun social hour/mixer.\nWe have spent years crafting our internship process into what we believe is a valuable opportunity for anyone who is trying to break into our industry. It\u2019s challenging and at times can be a bit of a push out of their comfort zone. However, our unique approach to how we so intricately weave these candidates into our BizStream family is what makes BizStream such a unique place to work.\nWe offer internships in many fields, including web development, creative design, and marketing.

{"id":"232","pageTitle":"TUEASFIH","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/transforming-user-engagement-advanced-search-functionality-in-healthcare/","text":"Transforming User Engagement: Advanced Search Functionality in Healthcare\nRobust search functionality on a healthcare website ensures patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals can access the necessary information quickly. In an industry where timely access to accurate information can significantly impact outcomes, an intuitive search tool enhances user experience and builds trust in your website as a reliable resource.\nThe primary audience includes patients searching for symptoms, treatments, and healthcare services; caregivers seeking guidance on supporting loved ones; and healthcare professionals needing quick access to medical resources and research. Specific searches might include finding nearby specialists, managing chronic conditions, or accessing clinical guidelines. Efficient search functionality ensures these users find the precise information they need, improving their overall experience.\nHere are some key points to consider when developing robust search functionality:\nEnsuring the search functionality is user-friendly involves clear design and intuitive navigation. Best practices include placing the search bar in a prominent location, offering auto-suggestions to guide users, and providing filters to refine results. Consider the readability and accessibility of the search interface, making sure it caters to users of all ages and technical abilities.\nWith the increasing use of mobile devices, optimizing search functionality for mobile is essential. A mobile-friendly search tool should be responsive, load quickly, and have touch-friendly elements. Voice search capabilities can also be a significant advantage, allowing users to search hands-free, which is particularly useful in healthcare settings.\nImplementing multi-faceted searching allows users to filter results based on various criteria such as location, specialty, condition, and treatment type. This helps users narrow down their search results to the most relevant information quickly. Offering a range of filters and sorting options ensures that users can customize their search experience to meet their specific needs.\nSemantic search capabilities enhance the search experience by understanding the context and intent behind a user\u2019s query rather than just matching keywords. This leads to more accurate and relevant search results, as the search tool can interpret natural language queries and recognize synonyms, related terms, and the context of medical terminology. For example, a search for \u201Cheart attack\u201D would also return results for \u201Cmyocardial infarction,\u201D ensuring comprehensive information retrieval.\nProviding multi-language search capabilities is essential for catering to a diverse audience. It ensures that non-English speaking users can access information in their preferred language, enhancing inclusivity and accessibility. This is particularly important in healthcare, where understanding medical information accurately can significantly impact health outcomes. Implementing multi-language search capabilities can also improve the user experience for international patients or caregivers seeking information about medical conditions and treatments.\nA well-organized data and content structure is fundamental to an effective search tool. Information should be categorized and tagged appropriately to ensure search queries return accurate results. Using standardized medical terminology and ensuring consistency across all content helps improve search accuracy and relevance.\nIntegrating search analytics and reporting capabilities allows website administrators to monitor and analyze user search behavior. This data provides insights into what users are looking for, which search terms are most popular, and where users might be encountering difficulties. These insights can inform content creation, website improvements, and overall user experience enhancements. For instance, if a significant number of users search for information on a specific condition, it might indicate a need for more comprehensive content on that topic.\nDeciding between a custom-built search tool and an out-of-the-box solution depends on your specific needs and resources. Custom tools offer tailored functionalities and can integrate seamlessly with your existing systems but may require more time and investment. Out-of-the-box solutions are quicker to implement and can be cost-effective, though they might lack some customization options.\nAn efficient search functionality helps patients connect to the information and services they need faster, enhancing their overall experience. Quick access to relevant health information, appointment scheduling, and specialist directories means patients spend less time searching and more time addressing their health concerns, leading to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Implementing these advanced search capabilities can significantly enhance the usability and effectiveness of a healthcare website, ensuring that users can connect with the information and resources they need more easily and efficiently. This leads to better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and a stronger reputation for the healthcare provider.\nBizStream recently took on the challenge of enhancing Prevea Health\u2019s website, focusing on improving its search functionality. This project underscores the importance of robust search capabilities on healthcare websites, ensuring users can quickly access vital information.\nBy building a custom search tool using Microsoft Azure AI Search, BizStream aimed to refine provider and location search capabilities, optimize mobile search experiences, and boost overall search speed and accuracy.\nLeveraging Azure Search indexes and integrating with the Prevea Mobile App, BizStream delivered a streamlined, fast user experience. Key achievements included:\nThese enhancements also significantly improved content management, reduced duplicated content, and provided a robust framework for Prevea Health\u2019s internal teams to manage. The collaboration between BizStream and Prevea Health ensured a modernized, efficient website that better serves its users.For more details, visit the Prevea Health project page.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"233","pageTitle":"XBKABOFA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-a-breath-of-fresh-air/","text":"Xperience by Kentico: A Breath of Fresh Air\nOver the last few months, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of starting to get my feet wet with Kentico\u2019s latest DXP offering, Xperience by Kentico. And when I say it\u2019s been a pleasure to work with, I really mean it. The sheer speed of everything (and not just the administration application), combined with an excellent developer experience and an active, growing community surrounding it, makes Xperience by Kentico a breath of fresh air for content administrators and developers alike.\nOne of the first things you\u2019re likely to notice when working with a site that\u2019s been built using Xperience, is the incredible speed at which you can navigate and manage your site(s). If you\u2019ve worked with Kentico sites in the past, I can assure you that Xperience\u2019s administration interface is a massive leap forward.\nOutside of using the administrative application itself, there\u2019s still so much more to love. One of the great aspects of this new platform is the rate at which new features are being added to the product. There\u2019s monthly \u201Crefreshes\u201D, as they\u2019re called, and each one is packed full of new features for both content administrators and developers.\nSpeaking of developers, one of the biggest speed improvements is found in the act of building and running the site. Gone are the days of waiting 30\u002B seconds for a heavy CMS administration site to spin up and initialize in order to validate that your changes are working as expected. Since Xperience has been built using .NET Core and React, it takes only a few seconds to go from dotnet watch to interacting with your site.\nSticking with the topic of developers, there\u2019s so many aspects of the new Xperience platform that give it an excellent developer experience.\nOne of the things I\u2019ve come to appreciate the most about Xperience is the plethora of things that can be accomplished via the .NET CLI. From the usage of dotnet templates for spinning up a new site, to using the kentico-xperience-dbmanager for spinning up databases, and a handful of flags that can be used with dotnet run in order to update the database version and execute Kentico CI and CD commands. There\u2019s even CLI commands to generate code based on the content types, forms, reusable field schemas, and module classes that are built within the DXP to be used by your presentation site\u2019s code.\nDue to all the application management that can be done from the CLI, it makes building, configuring, and extending the CI/CD configuration for your solution extremely easy and straightforward. Combine that with the fact that everything is based on .NET Core now, making it so the underlying build agent can be Linux, and you\u2019ve got yourself a recipe for incredibly fast builds and releases.\nOne of the powerful things we\u2019ve been able to implement on our projects (which is a bit of a copy of what\u2019s been done on the Kentico Community Portal site), which is the idea of spinning up a SQL Server instance, restoring a database backup, running Kentico CI Restore to get the database in sync with the latest changes, then running Kentico CD Store in order to serialize whatever files are needed on the destination machine in order to run the Kentico CD Restore command post-deployment to sync up any object or content changes that need to exist \uD83E\uDD2F. That may sound like a lot, and you might need to re-read that a few times to follow everything that\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s been a powerful way to generate the CD files as part of the build process, rather than needing developers to continuously commit those files to the repository, which will be changing for each deployment, and are more or less duplicates of many of the CI files that are already present in the repository.\nYou may be wondering though, \u201Cdoesn\u2019t all that drastically slow down your CI/CD builds?\u201D. If we were still using Windows build agents, then yes, because I was seeing build times in the 10-12 minute range when including these database and serialization steps. But when building on Linux agents, it\u2019s able to build the solution, run all the steps above, and publish the results as an artifact in just 2.5 minutes on average. That\u2019s about a 2x-3x speed improvement over just building .NET Framework solutions back in the day.\nThe points above obviously already hit on some of the benefits of being on modern tech like .NET Core, but the conversation doesn\u2019t end there. If you\u2019ve worked on a Kentico site recently, you likely know that whenever you needed to make any customizations to the administration interface, you were required to do so by building out your UI and backend logic using Web Forms. Compare that to Xperience, where your customizations are all built using React, a modern and widely adopted Javascript framework.\nOne of the biggest benefits of being on a modern tech stack like .NET Core and React, is the fact that more developers are familiar with these technologies and will be better equipped to build and maintain sites that are built using them. I would also wager that it\u2019s easier to find new developers with React experience than it is finding ones with Web Forms experience, so easier hiring can also be a great potential downstream effect of moving to a platform like Xperience.\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked on a brand new platform that didn\u2019t have great documentation or had a small number of people building with it, you know the pain of feeling stuck with nowhere to go. Thankfully, the Xperience community and platform are mature enough to provide you with everything you need to build out excellent digital experiences without the dreadful feeling of being alone.\nThe first place you can turn to would be the extremely thorough documentation about the platform. Nearly everything you would need to know about using the administration interface as a content administrator, or building out websites or email channels and all the components that go along with each, can be found within the Xperience Documentation site.\nIf you happen to strike out with finding what you need in the documentation, the next best place to look would be the Kentico Community Portal. This is a great resource due to the information that can be found within the blog posts, as well as the Q\u0026A section of the site. If you can\u2019t find an existing question that matches whatever it is you\u2019re running into, you can create an account and ask away!\nIn the unlikely event that both options above don\u2019t pan out, you can always join the Kentico Xperience Community Slack Organization. The members of this Slack Organization are quick to provide their thoughts and ideas when questions are asked in their respective channels.\nAs you can hopefully deduce from the points above, there\u2019s a lot to love about the Xperience platform. Regardless of if you\u2019ve worked on Kentico projects in the past, I would highly recommend giving Xperience a closer look if you haven\u2019t already. As someone who has helped develop a couple different types of projects in recent months, I\u2019ve been able to do a deep dive into Xperience, and I\u2019m incredibly excited to continue building projects with it for years to come.\nCheck out this video to hear BizStream team members share their experiences and insights on using Xperience by Kentico.\nWant more info about how we can help you with your Kentico project?

Developers are typically pulled away from writing their business logic and what matters most to deal with the complexity of the cloud. To help simplify cloud app complexity, Microsoft has introduced .NET Aspire. It includes a curated set of components that make sense to use in your C# projects. .NET Aspire makes it easy to discover, acquire, and configure essential dependencies for cloud-native apps from the very beginning of your project.

{"id":"235","pageTitle":"FTFC2","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/five-takeaways-from-config-2024/","text":"Five Takeaways from Config 2024\nI had the amazing opportunity to attend Figma\u2019s annual conference, Config, in San Francisco, CA. It was great to be among thousands of fellow designers, developers, and other creative folks. Figma puts on quite a show; from the physical signage inside and outside the conference hall, to the amazing motion graphics between sessions. Everything was on brand and super cool! Check it out\u2026\nFigma has unveiled a major redesign of their app\u2019s UI, code named: UI3. The goal of UI3 is to enhance Figma by focusing on key improvements: it prioritizes user ideas over the UI, balances the interface for both new and professional users, adapts to modern design practices with reusable components and generative AI, and lays the groundwork for future tools like Figma Slides while integrating design and code through Dev Mode and Figma AI.\nLearn more about Figma UI3\nPeople have been creating slide presentations in Figma for many years. However, it wasn\u2019t a native aspect of the tool. So, features like \u201Cpresenter notes\u201D and easy reordering of slides weren\u2019t available. That\u2019s no longer the case because Figma Slides were announced at Config 2024! Figma Slides is a user-friendly presentation tool for all team members, making it easy to create and collaborate on slide decks for design reviews, startup pitches, class projects, and conference talks. It supports real-time collaboration, ensuring decks are always up-to-date without the need to save or share multiple versions. Plus, shared asset libraries can be used in your presentations!\nLearn more about Figma Slides\nIn a nod to artificial intelligence\u2019s growing influence, Figma introduced AI-powered design assistance tools under the banner of Figma AI. These tools allow for visual search, automatic layer renaming, relevant content generation, instant background removal, copy rewriting, and translation.\nLearn more about Figma AI\nFigma announced updates to Dev Mode and Code Connect. Dev Mode now has statuses, which show the current handoff state of designs, including designer notes and changes. The statuses include \u201CReady for dev,\u201D \u201CChanged,\u201D, and \u201CCompleted.\u201D Code Connect bridges your component codebase to Figma, integrating your design system component code directly into Dev Mode. It allows you to preview example components that reflect your production framework, displaying real-world code snippets.\nLearn more about Dev Mode and Code Connect\nChanging an existing design with many objects within it to Auto Layout would often lead to shifts in the design and require some rework to function as intended. But now, when you use the Suggest Auto Layout feature, Figma analyzes which objects in a frame or component should be placed within an auto layout frame. It then adds the necessary auto layout frames to make the entire design responsive. These frames are created simultaneously, aiming to preserve the original placement of your designs. Awesome!\nLearn more about Suggest Auto Layout\nConfig 2024 has once again demonstrated Figma\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in design. From more powerful layout tools and interactive components to AI-driven assistance, these updates are set to enhance productivity, creativity, and collaboration for design teams around the globe. As we integrate these new features into our workflows, we look forward to a more efficient, innovative, and enjoyable design process for ourselves and our clients.\nOne more thing\u2026 Read more about Everything that Happened at Config\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Picture this: we gather for our company-wide Monday Pulse meeting every Monday. It\u2019s our weekly ritual where we look back at the past week, figure out where we\u2019re at, and peer into the future to see where we\u2019re heading. It\u2019s like our Monday morning GPS, helping us zero in on what matters most for the week ahead.\nIf you haven\u2019t caught on yet, BizStream does things a little differently than your average company. One of those things is that we\u2019re pretty big on our core values, which include \u201CWhatever It Takes,\u201D \u201CWork Hard, Play Hard,\u201D \u201CWe Are a Team,\u201D \u201CBe Fearless,\u201D \u201CFoster Growth in Others,\u201D \u201CCare,\u201D and \u201CBe Positive.\u201D Picture this: we gather for our company-wide Monday Pulse meeting every Monday. It\u2019s our weekly ritual where we look back at the past week, figure out where we\u2019re at, and peer into the future to see where we\u2019re heading. It\u2019s like our Monday morning GPS, helping us zero in on what matters most for the week ahead.\nHere\u2019s the twist: once every few weeks, we take a slight detour from the routine and dive deep into one of our core values. We\u2019re not just talking about it for the sake of it; we make it a bit personal. We throw a curveball and select a random team member to delve into that core value. It\u2019s like we\u2019re peeling back the curtain on our values to see what it means to others. This helps solidify and grant perspective you might not always have if it was just a bunch of words bantered about on company letterhead or plastered to the break room wall.\nSo, guess what? Yours truly got the opportunity to shed light on \u201CFostering Growth in Others\u201D recently. Now, usually, I\u2019m all in for these sessions, but this one felt a bit different.\nEvery year, during our annual reviews, we\u2019re handed the scorecard and asked to rate ourselves against our core values. It\u2019s a bit like holding up a mirror, a chance to see if we\u2019re still in sync with the company and its values. Now, when it comes to \u201CFostering Growth,\u201D I\u2019ve found myself in a bit of a loop, marking myself down or feeling like I\u2019m grappling with it. Why? Well, BizStream attracts extremely smart and intelligent people, and here I am, just the IT guy who is self-made and has no extraordinary degree or training. How on earth can I fan the flames of growth in a sea of already brilliant minds?\nI pondered this for a week. How do I articulate this core value when I\u2019m not entirely sure if I\u2019m playing the game right? Luckily, I had some time to mull it over (props to whoever gave me the heads-up).\nI wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, so I did a little etymology and looked up the word foster.\u00A0 Here is what it said:\nWell, that is interesting \u2013 nowhere did it shout \u201Cknowledge.\u201D Surprising, right? Until then, I had this idea that I needed to be this knowledge wizard, dropping wisdom bombs left and right. But nope, it\u2019s more about being the spark, igniting that curiosity to dig deeper.\nThis newfound perspective got me excited. How can I be that spark? How can I light a fire under folks to grow their ideas? Then, I stumbled upon a gem from Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Treasure Island. He said, \u201CDon\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.\u201D Bingo! Fostering growth is all about planting that seed, that spark, and letting it grow.\nI don\u2019t have to be the Einstein of the room. I just need to pass along that contagious energy to learn something new. Even if they don\u2019t pick up exactly what I\u2019m into, it\u2019s the act of learning itself that matters. So, armed with this fresh perspective, I threw it all into a presentation. I had no clue how it would land, but I wanted to share it, to pass on that spark, and hope it\u2019d make someone want to dig deeper.\nI think it landed where I wanted it to, and everyone understood where I was coming from.\nI hope this little journey sparks something in you \u2013 a spark to dive deeper and share your own fire. Because at the end of the day, fostering growth is about passing on that spark, embracing the excitement of learning, and seeing where it takes you.

However, for some clients, working through a full brand redesign may not be the right business decision for their marketing or business goals. For these clients, we suggest a brand refinement instead.\nBrand refinement is a strategic decision that builds on the clients\u2019 existing brand, no matter how much or how little of the brand may exist. The primary goal of a brand refinement is to fix or improve the parts of the brand that need updating while maintaining the brand recognition and brand equity that already exists with the current brand.\nA brand refinement follows the same process as a full brand redesign. The main difference is that the amount of the brand that is modified or updated at each step is more streamlined.\nThe branding process includes working through each of the following steps:\nAny project we work on requires some research and discovery. During this step, we take time to get to know and understand your business, your competitors, your customers\u2019 needs, and what makes your business unique. We will also discuss how you use your brand in various media and the issues you are having.\nFor brand refinement we will:\nFor the messaging platform, we will examine how you talk about your company and how you differentiate yourself in the marketing materials you produce. We will also work on developing your brand story and determining the key messages that best support it.\nFor brand refinement we will:\nDuring the brand identity step, we will examine your brand\u2019s core visuals, including your logo, color palette, and typography to the graphic elements and photographic imagery you use. Think of these as the \u201Cparts and pieces\u201D of your brand. This step is very exciting as the first visual aspects of the brand start to take shape.\nFor brand refinement we will:\nThe visual brand experience is how the \u201Cparts and pieces\u201D of your brand identity are uniquely put together for your brand. The visual brand experience step is all about developing the custom layouts, design elements, and photography treatments for all of your marketing materials and customer touchpoints. We like to call these custom treatments and layouts your \u201Cbrand expressions.\u201D\nThis is one of the most fun parts of any brand project. During this step, there is a lot of visual exploration, trying out different combinations of colors, fonts, graphic elements, and imagery to see which treatments are the most compelling and effective.\nFor brand refinement we will:\nOnce decisions have been made for your messaging, brand identity, and brand expressions, these choices need to be documented for use going forward. The brand consistency step is all about defining your brand standards to ensure consistency and maintain the integrity of your brand. This often takes the form of a brand guide that can be used internally or externally with any vendor who will need to work with your brand.\nFor brand refinement we will:\nUltimately, the strategy behind any brand update should be guided by a clear vision for the future of your brand and a deep understanding of your customers and your business goals. By taking a thoughtful and strategic approach to refining your brand, you can position yourself for long-term success and ensure that your brand remains relevant and impactful for years to come.\nWe\u2019d love to help you with your next branding project.

From their humble beginnings to their current status as a thriving retail hub, they have become a cherished staple in the region. However, over these years of growth and expansion their logo, messaging, and overall brand experience hasn\u2019t quite grown along with them. Countryside Greenhouse partnered with BizStream, a local branding and website agency, to help them refresh their brand and redesign their website to match.\nFor many years, Countryside Greenhouse has worked with BizStream for their website needs. Early in 2023, Countryside Greenhouse came to BizStream knowing they wanted to update their website. What portions needed to be updated, and how much they needed to be updated was all discussed. During these talks the subject of the Countryside Greenhouse brand also came up. BizStream presented the idea that if we strengthened and improved the brand, redesigning and updating the Countryside Greenhouse website would be much easier, and better. Plus, the brand improvements would help with Countryside Greenhouse\u2019s outward marketing needs as well.\nBizStream led the Countryside Greenhouse team through a series of brand exercises in order to hone in on brand attributes that fit with where they wanted the brand to go, brand pillars that help set them apart from their competitors, and who their target audience segments are. These steps helped set the stage for the BizStream design team to start exploring where the visuals of the brand would go and create alignment for everyone involved.\nAfter exploring some various directions for the Countryside Greenhouse logo, it was decided that some updates definitely needed to be made, but the logo should also feel somewhat familiar to longtime customers. So the symbol of the three flowers was retained, but simplified and cleaned up, to better fit with the rest of the brand.To liven things up, more colors were added to the color palette, more stylized brand fonts were chosen, and brand graphic elements (flower and leaf outlines) were introduced to the brand. All of these brand assets give the Countryside Greenhouse marketing team more options as they put together billboards and social posts.\nThe brand updates were used to inform the website redesign as well. Adding in more of the new brand colors, brand graphics, and updated brand fonts helps give the whole site a more friendly and inviting feel. These improvements, in combination with the simplified navigation, and overhauled gift card purchasing process, has made the user experience of the Countryside Greenhouse website much better and more inline with what Countryside Greenhouse customers would expect from a brand of their kind.\nFlowers and plants make people happy. They are used to add color to drab spaces, and bring life and vibrancy to mundane yards and landscapes. The reinvigorated Countryside Greenhouse brand and digital presence aim to do the same\u2014bring a little joy into customers\u2019 lives, and put a smile on their faces. Experience the magic of Countryside Greenhouse today and discover why they\u2019re the premier destination for all your gardening, landscaping, and potting essentials.\nBizStream crafted a new brand identity and visual experience that better suits who Countryside Greenhouse is as a company and resonates more strongly with their target audience.\nReady to amp up your digital presence?

{"id":"248","pageTitle":"HTI.8BSCWKX","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-integrate-net-8-blazor-server-components-with-kentico-xperience/","text":"How to Integrate .NET 8 Blazor Server Components with Kentico Xperience\nThis past November, Microsoft released the highly anticipated\u00A0.NET 8. But what makes this release so significant? To understand this, we must first look back. Up to and including .NET 7, Blazor offered two hosting models for building web applications.\nBlazor Server, which renders the content on the server and relies on a socket connection to handle any UI interactions. Those interactions are sent back to the server over the socket to be handled by the server. This allows the server to have a quick initial load but because of the socket, it is prone to errors if there are any network or latency issues.\nBlazer Web Assembly (WASM) has a better browser experience because the application is packaged up and runs directly in the browser but at the cost of a large initial load. It also requires a separate web API to handle any backend interactions.\n.NET 8 still uses these hosting models but has introduced new rendering modes that give you much more flexibility on how you can display your components. With the new Interactive Auto rendering mode, you can start with Interactive Blazor Server SSR\u00A0and then be handed off to the Blazor WASM bundle once that finishes downloading. This allows you to get the best of both worlds.\nYes, there are many other improvements, but these are the ones I\u2019m excited about.\nOne thing I love about the Blazor Razor Components is that you can easily use them on established sites. In my example, I\u2019m going to add a new Component to Kentico\u2019s Dancing Goat Sample site.\nKentico added support for .NET 8 with the release of Kentico 13 refresh 11 however, the installer still uses .NET 6 for Dancing Goat. This is an easy change. Just update the TargetFramework in the DancingGoat.csproj file to use .NET 8 instead of 6.\nEdit the Startup.cs to add the Blazor Services\nThis step is just a preference to keep my components organized and differentiate them from other ViewComponents that already exist on the site.\nFor my example, I\u2019ve chosen to create a component to display the list of cafes on the Cafe Section page.\nCreate a new file in the Blazor components folder named CafesComponent.razor.\nWe are going to convert the list of cafes in the View/Cafes/Index.cshtml file into our new component. Copy the code from the source Dancing Goat view into our new component; it should be about lines 6 through 30. We\u2019ll also create a new parameter so we can pass the cafes to the component. Our final output should look like the one below.\n@cafe.Contact.Phone\n@cafe.Note\nNow that we have our new component created, we can implement it in the Cafes section View. To do that, we simply delete the code that we copied from the .cshtml file and call our CafesComponent.\nNow, it\u2019s ready to build and run.\nIncorporating a bit of Blazor into your Kentico Xperience 13 site is an excellent way to explore the new technology without committing to a complete site overhaul. This gradual approach allows you to experiment with Blazor\u2019s features, such as its component-based architecture and reusable UI elements, making it easier to add interactive features to your application.\nBy integrating Blazor alongside your existing MVC framework, you can see how it improves the overall functionality and performance of your site. This method provides valuable insights into how Blazor fits into your development workflow, helping you decide if further integration is right for your project.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"249","pageTitle":"3UKMF","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-under-utilized-kentico-marketing-features/","text":"3 Under-utilized Kentico Marketing Features\nAt Bizstream, we build a lot of websites, many of which are on the CMS platform Kentico. We\u2019ve helped many clients use some of Kentico\u2019s best features. Page builder widgets for example, make content creation extremely easy for marketers. Widgets let content admins drag and drop, copy and paste, and rearrange content with only a few clicks.\nOn the flip side, we see a lot of great features that are often underutilized in Kentico. Some of these features might not be useful for every company, but many would do well to add them to their marketing arsenal. We\u2019re going to be looking at three:\nUsing these tools, marketing teams can greatly expand their understanding of their customers and create more targeted and relevant content.\nA/B testing is when you display two types of marketing content to different audiences to see which performs better. For instance, a website may be performing an A/B test for the image used on a specific featured item.\nA/B testing is one of the most under-utilized features in marketing. Instead of spending time arguing internally whether a page should feature an image or a video, creating an A/B test and seeing which one performs the best can give you fast and accurate results. You may find one beats the other by a landslide, or you may find there is hardly any difference at all.\nFirst, A/B testing needs to be set up in order for content admins to be able to use it. Once enabled, content admins need only to go to the page they would like to create an A/B test on and select \u201CCreate an A/B Test\u201D. This will open a modal that will then allow the content admin to configure, start, and evaluate the A/B test.\nFirst, just as we all learned in science class, you can only test one variable at a time. If you create an A/B test with several different elements between the two pages, you won\u2019t know why one performed better than the other. As you can see in the image above, the only difference between the two tests is that one has an image, and one has a video.\nA/B tests should have a limited duration. Get the answers you are looking for, then choose the better performing test. If you\u2019ve had 5000 site visitors since beginning the test and 70% chose option A and 30% chose option B, that is plenty of data to know which to go with. Keeping an A/B test running for too long can hurt SEO.\nWhile you should only have one primary difference between any given A/B test, you can (and should) have multiple A/B tests going at any given time. Once you know which option is performing better or if there is no significant difference, iterate on the last test to continue improving your content. This will allow you to continue learning from your customers about what content they like and don\u2019t like.\nFor many companies and organizations, they don\u2019t have a single type of audience coming to their website. Different audience types viewing your site may not overlap in user behavior, interests, attributes, and characteristics. As a marketer, you want to show content relevant to the customers viewing the site, not content that is irrelevant to them.\nThis creates a challenge for marketers since it seems like your choices are either to show multiple types of content (which means showing things to users who don\u2019t want to see it) or only show generic content that could be for everyone but that isn\u2019t as helpful for anyone.\nThis is where personas prove their worth. Personas allow marketers to easily segment users by their behavior and attributes and then tailor content to those users based on the persona they fall into.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you have a company that sells running shoes. One audience type is for someone who is simply looking for a new pair of shoes. Let\u2019s call that audience \u201CNew Buyers\u201D. Another known customer is someone who is looking for races that you have listed on the site. This audience is called \u201CRacers\u201D. Finally, there are some customers that are raving fans of your brand and often buy merchandise and specialized shoes that have a limited amount made. Let\u2019s call this audience \u201CLoyalty Customers\u201D.\nIn Kentico, content admins can define these personas by assigning \u201Cpoints\u201D to a user who matches certain attributes and behaviors. Personas are then set at a threshold and once a user meets that threshold, they are added to that group. For example, let\u2019s set up the following point values and thresholds for our three user groups.\n\u2013 Opens a product page \u2013 66 points\n\u2013 Comes from selecting an advertisement \u2013 80 points\n\u2013 Selects an events detail page \u2013 34 points\n\u2013 Submits a form to keep updated on racing events \u2013 75 points\n\u2013 Registers for an event \u2013 100 points\n\u2013 Selects a limited shoe product \u2013 51 points\n\u2013 Purchases a limited limited shoe product \u2013 100 points\nLet\u2019s say a user comes to the site and does the following:\nThis user would receive 146 points for being a new buyer and 109 points for the Racer\u2019s audience. Since the user is further past the New Buyer threshold as a percentage, Kentico will place them in that persona.\nContent admins can then use this knowledge to create specific content to that persona type through their site, email blasts, and campaigns, giving users content that is specific and relevant to them.\nKentico offers campaigns to track and measure traffic to your site using cookies. This helps content admins see which marketing strategies are most successful and which aren\u2019t working. Similar to tracking personas, campaigns let admins define conversions by their actions on your site.\nCampaigns can be used to promote a new product or simply to attract more users to your site. Once a campaign is running, content admins can see the number of visitors who came through it and how many were ultimately converted.\nOkay, it is not Kentico-specific, but I need to call this one out as a bonus item. You may be saying to yourself, GA4 is not an under-utilized feature, every site has GA4 these days. Maybe, but how well do your marketers actually use it? Do they know what they are tracking? More importantly, do they know what the data they are tracking means? More importantly still, are they listening to what the data is telling them? If you answered no to any of these questions, I would argue that you are not using Google Analytics to its full potential.\nKentico, like many CMSs, has many great features. Some may take more time getting used to or figuring out how to use them, but the ROI can make it well worth the time. A/B testing, personas, and campaigns are all powerful tools for elevating your marketing and website game to the next level.\nReady to elevate your marketing efforts on your Kentico website?

That\u2019s a terrible statistic, and as someone who has spent years managing projects, it\u2019s not one I want to be associated with.\nIn the dynamic world of web development, aligning project execution with business objectives is crucial. Working at an agency, ensuring that projects are not only completed to the client\u2019s expectations but also profitable requires a vigilant approach. This blog post outlines a systematic method to evaluate your web development projects, focusing on financial alignment, project execution, client interaction, and team feedback. Truth be told, there are several factors that need to be considered to know if a project is on track or off track. As we look across our project, we ask ourselves a series of questions to help us make that call.\nIt\u2019s essential to ensure that invoicing schedules and project timelines are in harmony. Evaluate if adjustments are needed to reflect the project\u2019s progress. For example, if we have completed 25% of the project milestones, we should have expended about 25% of the budget. If that is not the case, we need to understand why that might be and if we need to take measures to get those items in alignment.\nSimilarly, we regularly review the progress of the team by looking at several variables. Are the budgeted hours enough to complete the remaining backlog, considering not just development hours, but QA effort, our project ceremonies, and final testing and launch effort? What are the complex items, and what assumptions did we log when estimating that effort to the actual implementation? Are those assumptions holding, or were any new things uncovered along the way that we need to re-review and confirm with the client, potentially updating our estimate?\nWe have long considered our estimates to be just that, estimates. The work we do is very complex, and to hit a guess dead on is rarely ever going to happen. So, while we do concern ourselves with things going over-estimate, we are not worried if it is within a few hours. We would also expect to see some things going under-estimate and balance out. If we see trends going one way or the other, we look to course correct as we go forward. Along those same lines, we review the sprint run rate. Is the team putting in a consistent effort from sprint to sprint (in other words, do we know what our velocity is)? As the project gets close to completion, is the time trending downward? Epics should be completed, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is well underway, and we are focused on final optimization, which means we should not necessarily be full steam ahead if all prior work was done as expected.\nEvery sprint has a set of goals we need to accomplish, mostly around completing and delivering features. However, some goals are higher-level, like making final decisions on future scope or directions, or possibly completing User Acceptance Testing. Are we (our team and our client) succeeding in meeting our goals, or are we falling short? If we are falling short and cannot make up that effort, what timeline and cost changes need to be made?\nSpeaking of user acceptance testing, is our client able to test and provide feedback on the functionality delivered at the end of each sprint? This interaction is crucial for both project success and client satisfaction. When the client is testing as we deliver, the cycle of feedback is quick and efficient. We know if what we have delivered has met their expectations. Likewise, if something was missed, or we find a higher than normal rate of bugs or issues reported by the client, that may indicate a need for improved quality assurance processes. A lack of testing will create bottlenecks in team velocity down the road or a potentially problematic UAT experience where a larger team is identifying issues or gaps in requirements that create a start/stop situation while things get fixed that could have been identified much earlier in the project life cycle.\nMaybe a less specific way to tell if our project is on track or not is to gauge everyone\u2019s perception of the project completion percentage. We ask them, \u201CBased on what you know and what you are aware of, how far along do you think we are on this project, and why?\u201D Variations in estimates can be a valuable discussion point and may help us determine if a change is needed in how we are running the project.\nManaging the health and profitability of web development projects is not a one-time effort but an ongoing journey of continuous review and improvement. By regularly employing the evaluation methods outlined in this article\u2014focusing on financial alignment, meticulous execution, dynamic client interaction, and cohesive team feedback\u2014you can navigate the complexities of web development with greater confidence and efficiency. Remember, the goal is not just to cross the finish line but to do so in a way that maximizes client satisfaction, team morale, and business success.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"258","pageTitle":"HTCGDFUAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-copy-google-drive-files-using-apps-script/","text":"How to Copy Google Drive Files Using Apps Script\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, automating repetitive tasks is key to enhancing productivity and efficiency. One common task many of us face is the need to create copies of a Google Drive file, such as a Google Sheet, and share them with specific users or teams. Whether you\u2019re managing project templates, generating reports, or distributing resources, the manual process can be time-consuming. Fortunately, with Google Apps Script, a powerful scripting platform developed by Google, we can automate these tasks seamlessly. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll walk through the process of creating a Google Apps Script that copies a Google Drive file, sets specific permissions, and shares it with designated users or groups. We\u2019ll cover everything from setting up your script project to deploying it as a web application that can be called from any web app, making your document management process a breeze.\nNavigate to Apps Script and create a new project by clicking on \u201CNew Project.\u201D This is your workspace where the magic of automating Google operations begins. Rename your project at the top of the page to give a basic description of its purpose. As a final step to prepare your workspace, delete the default myFunction() declaration so that you have a clean slate.\nIf you plan on setting specific permissions on your copied file, it is best to enable the \u201CDrive API\u201D service within your project. Enabling it allows your script to communicate with the Google Drive API and adds additional functionality and methods for automating file management in Google Drive. To enable the service, follow these simple steps:\nChoose a Google Sheet (or any Google Drive file) as your template. For this tutorial, I will be using a Google Sheet. This file should be set up with any structure or data that you want as the starting point for all the copies that will be created. Note the file\u2019s ID from its URL, which uniquely identifies it on Google Drive. If you aren\u2019t sure how to get the ID, open the file. The ID is the value in the URL between the /d/ and /edit. Copy this value for the next step.\nNow that our template file is ready, it\u2019s time to create the main function for making a copy. I will be providing code snippets, but please reference the Apps Script documentation if you run into any issues or want to explore other methods and options for manipulating files.\nThis is self-explanatory, but we need to declare the function first. Give it a useful name, or use the name from this example. I am also passing in a parameter for projectName. Since we are making copies and placing them in the same folder, we want a way to name the new files differently. For my use case, I am using a project name for each file copy.\nDefine the IDs of your template file and the destination folder at the beginning of your function. The ID for the folder can be found similarly to the file ID. Open the folder in Google Drive and copy the value after /folders/. After defining the IDs, define the file and folder by referencing them via their IDs.\nName your file by setting a name variable. If you plan on using a parameter for a unique name, make sure you use it in this step. Use the template and parent folder references to make a copy of the template, placing it into the desired folder and renaming it dynamically.\nIf you need to set permissions on your file for specific email addresses, then add the general code structure below and update the emails array. In this example, I am setting edit permissions for the specified email addresses by setting their role to \u201Cwriter.\u201D I am also setting sendNotificationEmail to \u201Cfalse,\u201D which prevents emails from being sent to users, letting them know that a new file has been shared with them. If you prefer having these emails sent, set the value to \u201Ctrue\u201D.\nIf your file needs broader access, like domain-wide editing rights, this can be set with a single line of code. In this example, I am setting edit access for all domain users within my organization\u2019s Google Workspace.\nIf you want your function to return a value, such as the URL of the newly copied file, reference the code below. The copied Google Sheet had some unnecessary text at the end of the URL, which I removed before returning the value.\nBelow your main copy function, we need to add a doPost function to expose the main function as a web app. Apps Script requires the function to be named this way so that the function is callable via HTTP POST requests. Remember to pass the projectName parameter (or whichever parameter you decide to use).\nBefore deploying your script, test it within Apps Script to ensure it functions as expected. At the top of the code editor, make sure your main copy function is selected in the function drop-down, and then click \u201CRun.\u201D If everything is set up correctly, the function should complete, and your template file will be copied. Remember to delete extra file copies as you test. Use the debugger or log statements to troubleshoot any issues you may run into.\nUse an API client like Postman or Thunder Client to test your web app.\nTest the API call and make sure the file is copied as you expect.\nNow that we have a functioning web app, it can be integrated further into an application, script, or other program. For my use case, I integrated it into a Vue application using Axios. Here is a basic example of what that code looks like:\nThroughout this tutorial, we\u2019ve explored the powerful capabilities of Google Apps Script to automate the process of copying a Google Drive file, such as a Google Sheet, and configuring how it is shared. By breaking down the process into manageable steps, we\u2019ve demonstrated how easily you can streamline your document management tasks. This automation not only saves valuable time but also minimizes the risk of human error, ensuring consistency and efficiency in how resources are distributed within your team or organization. As you\u2019ve seen, Google Apps Script opens up an endless world of possibilities for automating workflows across Google\u2019s many applications and services. I encourage you to experiment further with Apps Script, exploring its extensive documentation and community resources to discover new ways to automate your workflows and make your daily tasks more efficient.

{"id":"260","pageTitle":"WEDSLV","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-every-developer-should-learn-vim/","text":"Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim\nNote: when I\u2019m referring to Vim in this blog post, I\u2019m referring to Vim Motions, not Vim the editor. Vim Motions can be enabled in most integrated development environments (IDEs) and would allow you to gain the benefits of Vim Motions without having to change your IDE. Learning the motions alone is hard enough, so don\u2019t try to learn a new editor simultaneously (unless, of course, you really want to).\nYup, that\u2019s me. You\u2019re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation\u2026\nIt all started just a few months ago when I randomly came across an old recording of a live stream by @realGeorgeHotz where he was writing a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) program, and I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly he was writing code and moving through his editor. At that point in time, I had no clue he was using Vim, but it made me realize that I\u2019m pretty slow in comparison, and I\u2019d love to be at that level of speed someday when writing code.\nThe exact timeline is a bit hazy, but it couldn\u2019t have been more than a week later that I started getting videos by @ThePrimeagen\u00A0recommended to me on YouTube, who also seemed to just effortlessly fly through his code and editor. At this point, I knew something was up and came to the realization that these guys knew something I didn\u2019t. After just a few more days of casual viewing, I finally stumbled across a video where @ThePrimeagen started raving about Vim and how effortless and fast text editing becomes once you take the time to learn it.\nThat was the secret sauce I couldn\u2019t put my finger on, and I was immediately torn. Do I learn Vim, or do I avoid it like the plague? I\u2019ve previously had coworkers on both sides of the Vim discussion; those who used it and swore by it and those who thought there was no way doing everything via your keyboard could possibly compete with the speed and efficiency of using a mouse in an editor, myself included. I went back to the original SLAM video I had watched, and sure enough, George was absolutely using Vim. It was at this moment that I realized I only had one path forward; to buckle down and get ready for the journey of learning Vim.\nAs much as I wish I could say, \u201CAfter an hour or so, you\u2019ll be up to speed and cruising along at the same pace as with a mouse, and after a full day, you\u2019ll be flying around your editor like @ThePrimeagen and @realGeorgeHotz,\u201D that\u2019s about as far from reality as you can get.\nLearning Vim is a process, and that process takes weeks of dedicated time (or months of dabbling) just to get up to the same speed as with a mouse. It\u2019s probably one of the steepest learning curves of anything I\u2019ve ever learned, but the payoff of learning it is extremely valuable, in my opinion.\nThe main reason for the extremely slow process of learning Vim is down to the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to go through just to move the cursor where you want it, copy text, paste text, etc., and it takes an extremely long time for those common actions to feel remotely close to muscle memory. I\u2019ve been on this learning journey for nearly four months as of writing this, and to this day, I\u2019m still having to recite the actions I want to take in my head as I\u2019m performing them.\n\u201CAlright, down four lines, (4j), yank the line (yy), up 16 lines (16k), select the current line (V), paste over it (p).\u201D\nI look forward to the day when all of that becomes second nature because that\u2019s when I\u2019ll really start to fly with Vim.\nAnother challenge of learning Vim (which also happens to draw some parallels to learning development) is the seemingly endless methods of accomplishing whatever it is you\u2019re attempting to do.\nLet\u2019s say you want to change the parameters of the TryParse method in the example below with your cursor starting at the beginning of the line:\nIf you\u2019re new to Vim and don\u2019t know many of the advanced motions yet, your initial thought would probably be to repeatedly press \u2018w\u2019 until you\u2019re at the start of the word \u2018role\u2019, enter visual mode with \u2018v\u2019, repeatedly press \u2018e\u2019 until you\u2019re at the end of the word \u2018roleId\u2019, press \u2018d\u2019 to delete what\u2019s currently selected, then press \u2018i\u2019 to enter insert mode and start typing the replacement.\nIf that sounds like a lot, that\u2019s because it is\u2026 and that approach is guaranteed to be slower than just using your mouse to make the same selection, press backspace, and then start typing the replacement. But when you\u2019re first starting out, that\u2019s all you know, so that\u2019s really your only option as you don\u2019t yet know a better way to approach it. (which is totally okay! You need to learn the basics before you start learning the more advanced stuff. You must learn to crawl before you can walk.)\nWith my current knowledge of Vim, if I were trying to do the same, I would first press \u2018f\u2019, followed by \u2018(\u2018, which would find the first \u2018(\u2018 in the line. I\u2019d then press \u2018;\u2019 to go to the next instance of that character, this time landing on the opening parenthesis of the TryParse method call. I\u2019d then use \u2018ci(\u2018 to \u201Cchange inside the parentheses\u201D. This removes the text within the parenthesis I\u2019m currently on (or in between) and puts me into insert mode immediately.\nThat approach is much better and is just as fast, if not faster, than trying to do the same with clicking and dragging with my mouse. In this specific case, I could likely be even faster by finding the \u2018,\u2019 character as that\u2019s faster than finding the first \u2018(\u2018 and having to navigate to the next one. So, with that improved approach, the full combination of keys would end up being \u2018f,ci(\u2018, which takes no time at all to execute.\nThe best advice I can give with regard to the difference in approaches above is to try not to get tripped up on finding the absolute optimal approach, especially when you\u2019re first learning. Be okay with a non-optimal approach that takes more time because you have to learn the basics no matter what. As time goes on and you get more comfortable with Vim, you can start looking into alternative approaches to performing certain actions. I find myself constantly doing things a certain way, then all of a sudden coming to the realization that there\u2019s a better way to do whatever it was I just did. I\u2019ll quickly undo my edits (using the \u2018u\u2019 key) and try the alternative approach I just thought of. If it feels better, I make a mental note to try and use that approach in the future when trying to accomplish that same thing again or something similar to it.\nIf you\u2019d like to know where I learned most of what I know up until now, I heavily leaned on this playlist on YouTube by @ThePrimeagen.\nI know there\u2019s been a few nuggets of information that point to some of the benefits of Vim in the section above, but I\u2019d like to do a deeper dive into some of them and also share some additional benefits I haven\u2019t covered yet.\nThis benefit has already been touched on above, but I still believe it\u2019s worth calling out in this section since it is definitely the main benefit of learning Vim. Anything that can make you a faster developer should be a no-brainer. As previously mentioned, you will be much slower when you first start. This is the most painful part of learning Vim, but once you\u2019re equally as fast with Vim as you are with a mouse, you will have crossed the threshold of gaining all the additional benefits outlined below with the additional upside of having the ability to continually get faster and faster as time goes on.\nThis may seem like a strange benefit, but switching between your keyboard and mouse less frequently can have a large impact on reducing your risk of developing an RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). Every time you have to move your hand from your keyboard to your mouse, you\u2019re putting strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The more times in a day you\u2019re performing this action, the higher your risk for RSI\u2019s.\nIf you\u2019re still using your existing IDE when learning Vim, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll still be using your mouse to navigate within your IDE. But reducing the risk of RSI\u2019s can be further enhanced by switching to a Vim-based editor (see \u201CAdoption of \u2018better\u2019 IDE\u2019s\u201D below)\nThis might be a bit more of a niche benefit, but this was definitely a big one for me. As someone who works on a Windows machine at work and has a macOS machine at home for personal projects, I would constantly get tripped up on Ctrl vs. Command when copying/pasting and all the differences in cursor movement between the two operating systems (Ctrl \u002B arrows in Windows are the same as Option \u002B arrows in macOS when moving the cursor in text files).\nAll this mental overhead went away once I was using Vim on both machines. Need to copy text? Just use \u2018y\u2019. Need to paste? Just use \u2018p\u2019. Need to undo? Just use \u2018u\u2019. Need to move the cursor word by word? Just use \u2018w\u2019.\nYou could make the argument that I just traded the mental overhead of switching between systems for the overhead of using Vim, but the beauty of Vim is that once it\u2019s learned, the mental overhead disappears. If I had stuck with my old approach, the mental overhead would still exist every time I switch systems until the end of time.\nAnother small but still impactful benefit that fits within the portability benefit is the ability to edit things like config files directly on servers that you\u2019re accessing via SSH. With Vim, you can quickly navigate and edit files when working in a GUI-less environment.\nThis section is extremely subjective since the best IDE for you is always going to be the one you\u2019re most comfortable using, but there\u2019s no harm in stepping outside your comfort zone and seeing what else might be available to you.\nIf I had to guess, most developers reading this are using VS Code as it has more or less become the industry standard for web development due to its extensibility afforded by their extension ecosystem. I, too, still use VS Code when writing code on Windows machines, as the Vim extension does a great job of giving me 90% of what I\u2019m looking for. The remaining 10% is down to limitations I\u2019ve found when it comes to navigating the IDE itself (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible to fix most, if not all, of the limitations I\u2019ve experienced, but I haven\u2019t taken the time to figure out how yet).\nIf you\u2019re someone who loves tinkering and wants to really dive deep into making an IDE that\u2019s tailored to your specific wants and desires, I\u2019d recommend looking into NeoVim. I\u2019d also recommend holding off until you\u2019ve got the basics of Vim down before doing so. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be trying to learn two things simultaneously, adding additional complexity.\nI ended up making my own NeoVim configuration based on a handful of tutorials I watched on the topic, and I\u2019ve found I much prefer working in my custom IDE than I do working in VS Code, but it could also be down to some additional tooling that I use that isn\u2019t available on Windows. My current setup on my personal macOS machine consists of using my custom NeoVim editor in conjunction with tmux, which is a terminal multiplexer. This allows me to easily switch between multiple instances of NeoVim, all individually configured for the needs of each project. This makes it super easy to jump between projects and pick up wherever I had last left off and also allows each project to be set up exactly how I like it. I even have some tmux plugins set up to handle saving the state of my sessions so that after a system reboot, all my sessions are exactly how they were before the restart.\nIt\u2019s also super easy to \u201Cpackage up\u201D your configuration, so it\u2019s super fast and easy to get spun up on a new machine. In my case, my tmux and NeoVim configuration files are in a repository on my GitHub, so whenever I set up a new machine, I just install NeoVim and tmux, clone my repo, create symlinks to the root of my user for the tmux and NeoVim configuration files and directories, and I\u2019m good to go. Everything is set up exactly how I previously had it, and it took less than a few minutes. It also allows me to make updates on any of my machines, push those changes to my repo, and then pull those changes on any other machines. Because of the symlinks, those changes are applied to my system as soon as I perform a pull operation.\nThe biggest benefit of NeoVim and tmux, in my opinion, is that I\u2019m able to navigate every aspect of my editor via my keyboard. This makes my development experience a dream, as all my coding can take place without ever needing to move my hands off my keyboard. It also makes it really enjoyable to work on just my laptop when I\u2019m on the go, as I don\u2019t need to constantly reach for the trackpad when navigating my IDE.\nMy hope is that this blog post has at least made you consider trying out Vim at some point, even if you\u2019ve previously sworn off the idea of ever giving it a chance. I was in that position not too long ago, and I can tell you from experience that as long as you stick with it and give it a fair chance, you might be surprised at how beneficial it is to learn Vim. While the path to mastering Vim may seem daunting, the endless possibilities it offers in terms of speed, health benefits, and adaptability make it a skill worth acquiring.

{"id":"262","pageTitle":"TCIGTKCP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/the-complete-idiots-guide-to-kentico-content-personalization/","text":"The Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide To Kentico Content Personalization\nIt\u2019s 2002, I\u2019m in the second semester of my freshman year of college, and I have a problem. I\u2019m a vocal performance major, but a few months into the school year now, I\u2019m starting to realize that my options with that degree were, shall we say, limited at best. So I have a choice in front of me; stick with trying to make a career out of singing and doing private lessons or switch my major.\nIf I wanted to stay in the music world and not make a hard left turn into something like physics or Spanish (both things I considered in high school), the option that sounded the best to me was becoming a composer/songwriter. Becoming a school teacher was not at all appealing, and other options were either too esoteric (ethnomusicology) or not something I was interested in (music production/engineering).\nSo, I decided to try my hand at writing music rather than just performing. I picked up a copy of The Complete Idiot\u2019s Guide to Songwriting and set to work, seeing if there was anything there before making the decision to change my major. I found the book super helpful with its basic introduction to concepts that I was vaguely familiar with but had never really put into practice myself. After working through a bunch of the content, I, ultimately ended up going into music education, which I did for a couple of years before bouncing around and, eventually, finding a home in the world of web development.\nSomeday, I might literally write the book on Online Marketing inside Kentico. For this post, however, let\u2019s focus on the core principle of the \u201CIdiot\u2019s Guide\u201D books, which is a basic introduction with no real assumptions on what you may or may not already know.\nThe term \u201CContent Personalization\u201D seems relatively self-explanatory, but in true \u201CIdiot\u2019s Guide\u201D fashion, let\u2019s start with the assumption that you\u2019re digging into this concept for the first time.When you visit a website, there are basically three ways that site can determine what to show you.\nEveryone who visits the site sees the same content all the time. These sites are often simple and meant to convey the same information to whoever decides to visit. That doesn\u2019t mean the content never updates, just that there\u2019s nothing extra going on behind the scenes to \u201Cdecide\u201D what content comes up when you visit the site. Some examples of sites with static content would be most blog sites or basic brochure sites telling users about your company / service / etc.\nWhat a user sees when they visit a site with conditional content depends on external factors such as time of day or year, what sales or promotions are currently happening, or what events are being promoted. What content is displayed relies on those external factors, not what user is visiting the site. Some examples of sites with conditional content are a business site that displays whether or not the business is currently open or a weather site that shows the current conditions and forecasts.\nWhat you see when you visit the site depends on who you are. You might see content targeted specifically for you based on your age, job title, industry, family status, purchase history, or any number of other factors. The site uses various methods of collecting information about you to try to show you content that is the most relevant to you. Some examples of sites with personalized content are most ecommerce sites or social media sites.\nAlright, so we know what content personalization is, but why do it? There are some obvious benefits to personalizing content for your users.If you can show users products that are related to something they purchased in the past, they are much more likely to buy that item versus the user having to start from scratch every time they want something from you. You\u2019re also exposing them to products they may not have even thought of or realized you carried.Personalizing content provides a better experience for your users. Nothing is more frustrating than reading a couple of great articles on a site and coming back later for more good content only to see a bunch of stuff that is not at all interesting to you. By showing users content based on what they have viewed previously, what industry they are in, etc., you are providing the most relevant content possible and increasing your user\u2019s satisfaction and engagement with your site.By personalizing content, you incentivize users to provide you with more information that can then be used in other marketing efforts. Let\u2019s say I, as a user, am told that I can get more personalized results on content, product recommendations, applicable sales / promotions, etc., if I give you some basic information about myself. Often, that takes the form of registering for an account. I\u2019m much more willing to provide my information if I feel like I am getting something in return for that data. We\u2019ve all bought something small or signed up for a newsletter after reading a good article, only to find out the emails you get afterward are not interesting or relevant to you. Taking some time to examine and segment your subscribers helps you provide content they are interested in, drives sales, and limits unsubscribes or, worse yet, the dreaded \u201Cspam\u201D button.\n\u201COkay! Fine! I get it. Content personalization is great, I\u2019m not an idiot. But how do I do it?\u201DFirst of all, you saw the title of this post, so don\u2019t get cranky with me now. Second of all\u2026 I\u2019m glad you asked!Kentico offers several ways to personalize your content for users. For this post, we\u2019ll do a higher-level review of two of the options since each piece of the full puzzle really deserves its own post to do it justice.\nWidget personalization is the most common and, arguably, the most useful version of personalization available to you and the one we will focus on primarily for this post. Your developers can enable widget personalization within the page builder feature of Kentico. Widget personalization allows you to do just that, personalize the content of a widget based on certain conditions. Those conditions can be whatever you need them to be so long as your developers can access that information about the person visiting your site (in Kentico, we call this visitor a \u201Ccontact\u201D). Two of the most common personalization conditions are by Persona or Contact Group.Once the feature is enabled by your developers and the conditions developed, you can access the options by clicking on the person icon on the top right corner of your widget.\nDepending on the type of condition you are using, you may be able to select more than one option. In our example here, I can select a single Persona to display the content to or multiple contact groups. This allows me a lot of control over how I decide to personalize the content for my users.\nYou can see, for conditions with more than one option I can also name my variant.Once I\u2019ve made my selection, and clicked \u201CAdd variant,\u201D this creates a version of the widget that will only be displayed to contacts who meet the conditions I set.\nImportant note!\nThe Original variant of your widget will always exist and will be displayed to users who don\u2019t meet any conditions. This means you can\u2019t hide a widget altogether if a contact doesn\u2019t meet any of the conditions you set on the variants.\nIf I want to make a change to what I selected, I can hover over the variant I want to change and choose to edit or delete it.\nIf you have more than one variant besides Original, you may run into a situation where a user meets the conditions for multiple variants. Kentico handles this by allowing you to order the variants however you like, with the Original variant always remaining at the bottom as a fallback. When a user visits your site, Kentico runs through the variants from top to bottom and displays the first one it encounters that have conditions that contact matches. You can reorder the options by clicking on the dot grid on the left of each variant and dragging it into the order you want.\nThe best part is, once you have all your different variants set up, you can copy and paste that widget wherever you want, and all your variants will come with it. Then, even if you want to completely change the content in each variant, you have them all set and ready to go.\nSometimes, you may have a need to customize a page to a higher degree than you are able to accomplish with widgets alone. Maybe you\u2019ve learned through A/B testing that one group of your users likes to read through the content of a page before committing to filling out a conversion form, while another group prefers to get right to the form rather than scroll through the page. Maybe you want to apply a whole new theme to the page or make some other larger change based on who is looking at the page.\nYour developers have full access to write conditions within the code that can make any number of changes based on the properties of the contact viewing the page. Those changes can be anything from the layout or color changes mentioned above to pulling in entirely different sets of data based on whatever you can work out between you and your developers.\nYou will want to think carefully about the degree and level of changes you make at this level. There is a balance between enhancing the user\u2019s experience and creating confusion for both your editors and your users. Visiting a page one day, updating your industry on a form, and then going back to that same page only for it to look completely different can be a disorienting experience. Similarly, your editors will have to be extra careful when creating content to ensure it works across all versions of a page and have quick and reliable ways to test that content with each variation. The general rule of thumb is to keep changes as minimal and as meaningful as possible.\nWhatever your needs are for content personalization, there is likely a solution within Kentico that will work for you. Just remember to take it one change at a time and measure the performance of each bit of personalization before you move on to the next. Also, make sure you don\u2019t drive your content team crazy, generating 16 unique versions of each callout, CTA tile, and paragraph on every page.\nNeed a hand with Kentico Content Personalization?

{"id":"263","pageTitle":"Pair Programming Unplugged","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/pair-programming-unplugged/","text":"Pair Programming Unplugged\nIn the world of software development, working together is the secret sauce that makes everything better. This way of teaming up isn\u2019t just about getting the job done; give it a shot, and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s like having a brainstorming session and a code check all rolled into one. Every line of code you write together is a mini-lesson in making cool stuff and solving puzzles. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to make sure what you\u2019re building doesn\u2019t just work but shines.\nPaired programming is a fast track to learning and professional growth, benefiting junior developers by enhancing their confidence through hands-on experience and immediate feedback. This past spring, I tackled phase 1 of a massive project and felt overwhelmed daily. Only six months into my career, I was faced with new technologies and extensive CMS customization. The challenge seemed impossible, but thanks to paired programming, I saw exponential growth in my skill set and confidence.\nThink about paired programming, like teaming up for a two-player video game. You and a buddy sit down, facing the same screen, tackling the same challenges, but with twice the brainpower. You\u2019re joining forces, the experienced player shares hidden strategies and power-ups with the enthusiastic newcomer. This gaming journey reflects the core of paired programming. The senior developer, armed with their arsenal of skills, and the junior, equipped with new ideas, team up to combine experience and innovation. This partnership not only boosts the junior\u2019s skills but also refreshes the senior\u2019s tactics, leading to an innovative solution that could be the next breakthrough in the tech arena.\nWhile on that big project, I found myself in a similar scenario. I was pairing up with multiple senior developers and peers. I was the newcomer, and they were the experienced players, sharing hidden strategies and power-ups. This dynamic transformed my understanding of software development. Several weeks into the project, I reached a turning point. I began taking on tasks independently, seeking assistance only when blocked. This was my level-up moment in the coding quest.\nThe immediate feedback and hands-on experience were like guardrails, ensuring I stayed on the right path while allowing me the freedom to explore and learn. This safety net was crucial in helping me gain confidence and significantly deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming.\nThis experience, akin to a gaming journey, reflects the core of paired programming. The partnership between the senior developer, armed with their arsenal of skills, and me, a junior developer with new ideas, boosted my skills and refreshed their tactics. Together, we combined experience and innovation, embodying the essence of paired programming where collaboration leads to breakthrough solutions.\nPaired programming is more than just coding together\u2014it\u2019s about supercharging the entire software development process. This collaborative journey brings a multitude of benefits, from enhancing code quality to fostering a vibrant team spirit.\nPair programming transforms the daunting task of debugging into a collaborative puzzle-solving adventure. I recall when I was lost in the depths of an old codebase, far from the familiar terrain of my usual tech stack. Each file seemed a mirror image of the next, devoid of unique identifiers, and I was at a standstill, unable to pinpoint the source of a persistent bug.\nEnter my pair programming partner, who introduced me to the Vue.js devtool extension for Google Chrome. This tool became the compass that guided us through the tangled code, allowing us to identify the precise Vue component in need of attention. With this newfound clarity, my confidence surged, and the process accelerated significantly.\nThis experience was a turning point, highlighting the power of pair programming not just in squashing bugs but in expanding my debugging toolkit. It underscored the importance of leveraging specific tools tailored to the task at hand, a lesson that has since encouraged me to explore and inquire about the array of tools available. Through this mutual learning journey, we not only ensure a more secure and efficient codebase but also foster a culture of continuous growth and curiosity among developers.\nPair programming isn\u2019t just about writing code\u2014it\u2019s about scrutinizing and refining every line in real-time. I remember several times in the last year when this collaborative approach directly impacted the quality of our codebase. One time in particular, I was initially set on building a new feature from scratch, but I encountered small blockers along the way. Fortunately, my pair programming partner\u2014a seasoned developer with a deep understanding of the codebase\u2014suggested a different approach.\nInstead of reinventing the wheel, we decided to refine and update the existing codebase to accommodate the new feature. This decision not only streamlined the development process but also resulted in a significant improvement in the overall code quality. Working side by side, I gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of the existing codebase, asking questions and receiving immediate answers that drastically enhanced my understanding.\nThis collaborative endeavor not only delivered the desired feature but also raised the standard of excellence within our team. By leveraging each other\u2019s expertise and insights, we not only achieved our immediate goals but also set a precedent for continuous improvement and excellence in our coding practices.\nPaired programming goes beyond writing code\u2014it\u2019s a masterclass in communication. I recently worked on a task where effective communication played a pivotal role in navigating a challenge. The task involved updating a feature for an existing project, but the acceptance criteria provided by the client was incomplete.\nFortunately, my pair programming partner, who had a longstanding relationship with the client, possessed a keen understanding of their communication style. Drawing from years of experience and a sharp memory of past meetings, he filled in the missing pieces of information, providing crucial context for the task at hand. Additionally, his deep understanding of the codebase guided me in the right direction, ensuring we stayed on track.\nThis experience underscored the importance of clear and open communication. It encouraged me to actively seek clarification and ask questions when uncertainty arose, fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration. By leveraging each other\u2019s strengths and insights, we not only overcame challenges but also strengthened our bond as a team, paving the way for greater productivity and success.\nThe prospect of coding with someone might seem intimidating at first, but paired programming is designed to turn these challenges into opportunities for growth. Through structured rotation and fostering an environment of open communication, teams learn to navigate these hurdles, enhancing their cohesion and agility.\nThe rise of remote work hasn\u2019t diminished the effectiveness of paired programming. Thanks to modern tools like Google Meet and Slack Huddle, teams can seamlessly collaborate regardless of physical distance. As someone who participates in remote pair programming sessions almost weekly, I\u2019ve experienced firsthand how these tools facilitate effective collaboration.\nPlatforms like Google Meet and Slack Huddle provide essential features like screen sharing, allowing us to easily navigate through code files together. However, remote collaboration does come with its challenges. In an office setting, we might point at the screen to reference a specific line of code, but in a remote environment, we rely on line numbers and identifiers to communicate effectively. Despite these challenges, my pair programming partner and I have adapted our communication methods to overcome these hurdles. This shift in communication has streamlined our remote collaboration process, ensuring that we can work together effectively regardless of our physical location.\nPair programming is more than a method; it\u2019s a journey of growth, fostering not only technical excellence but also personal development, effective communication, and a strong, collaborative team culture.

{"id":"264","pageTitle":"CNASSIKUWS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/composing-navigation-and-site-structure-in-kontent-ai-using-web-spotlight/","text":"Composing Navigation and Site Structure in Kontent.ai using Web Spotlight\nNavigating through the world of headless CMS can be complex, especially when content is entirely detached from the website\u2019s implementation. Traditional concepts of visualizing and structuring navigation become abstract for content editors without a direct view of the site they are building. However, Kontent.ai\u2019s Web Spotlight serves as a bridge between conventional and headless CMS approaches, offering a way to bring content and implementation closer together.\nWeb Spotlight provides a visual representation of your site, creating a more tactile experience for content editors. It facilitates easy webpage creation, content updates, and component rearrangement without the need for developers. It also offers device-specific previews to ensure your pages look great before they go live.\nIn an article by fellow Kontent.ai MVP Andy Thompson, various strategies for leveraging Web Spotlight in Kontent.ai are discussed. This blog post aims to consolidate some of those strategies, focusing on configuring Web Spotlight to model both the pages and navigation of your website.\nOne significant advantage of separating site structure and navigation is the freedom it provides in visually constructing menus. Using Web Spotlight, we can create both navigation and site structure, and these ideas can be extended for more intricate scenarios with additional content models. For instance, having separate models for header and footer navigation or channel-specific sitemaps.\nThe provided code snippets demonstrate the implementation using Next.js, but the concepts are applicable across different frameworks. One popular option is to utilize Web Spotlight to create a sitemap that mirrors the site\u2019s hierarchical structure. This sitemap then becomes a powerful tool for routing and link retrieval. The code below includes a function that recursively traverses all subpages of a page, yielding paths to the leaves of the tree.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a mechanism for defining routes, retrieving paths for static generation, and obtaining specific page data in the getStaticProps function. For simplifying data fetching, the post introduces SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) in the context of fetching navigation data. SWR will initially return the \u201Cstale\u201D data and also send a fetch request to retrieve the data normally. Then, once that request completes, you get the new data. This ensures that the navigation is always up-to-date and responsive to changes.\nThe following content models will need to be created:\nFirst, we will retrieve our sitemap with all of its linked items. Next, we need to find all the possible paths of our sitemap. Finally, we can find all the unique subpaths and create a map with keys as the URL slug and values as the page. The MAXIMUM_DEPTH constant is used to limit how far traversal will go. Both the Delivery API request and traversal will be limited to this value. Doing so ensures that we do not leave ourselves open the opportunity of infinite recursion. In particular, this pops up when a Page content item is reused in the navigation, causing a nesting loop.\nTo define routes, we can retrieve all the paths and return them from getStaticPaths. Then, in getStaticProps we get the specific page data we need for static generation.\nFor links, we can simply find a matching ID to a linked page and return the path.\nThe navigation is as simple as querying the Delivery API for your data and rendering it as needed.\nWeb Spotlight by Kontent.ai simplifies the challenge of separating content and website design. It provides flexibility in creating visually appealing menus and site structures. The code examples, showcased with Next.js, illustrate the ease of mapping out site hierarchy for efficient routing. Web Spotlight is a valuable tool for modern web development, allowing developers to break free from traditional CMS constraints.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"265","pageTitle":"EV3CAAPI","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/exploring-vue-3s-composition-api-and-performance-improvements/","text":"Exploring Vue 3\u2019s Composition API and Performance Improvements\nVue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration, making it a popular choice for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. As Vue.js moved from version 2 to version 3, several key enhancements and structural changes were introduced, changing the way developers approach front-end development.\nOne of the fundamental shifts lies in the architecture, where Vue 3 boasts improvements in performance, reactivity, and overall efficiency. Notably, the introduction of the Composition API gives developers a more modular and organized approach to building components, contrasting with Vue 2\u2019s Options API. These changes, along with improvements in TypeScript support, faster rendering, and enhanced tree-shaking for smaller bundle sizes, collectively make Vue 3 a compelling choice for developers seeking a modern and optimized front-end development experience.\nVue 3 brings about significant architectural changes, taking a large shift from its predecessor, Vue 2. The underlying architecture enhancements in Vue 3 have been re-crafted to deliver improved performance, higher reactivity, and increased overall efficiency. With a streamlined reactivity system based on the Proxy object, Vue 3 ensures more precise and fine-grained tracking of state changes, resulting in faster and more responsive applications.\nThe revamped Virtual DOM in Vue 3 contributes to improved rendering performance, minimizing unnecessary updates and enhancing the efficiency of UI updates. Additionally, the modular design of Vue 3, powered by the Composition API, enables developers to organize and reuse code more efficiently, promoting a scalable and maintainable codebase. These architectural refinements not only elevate the development experience but also position Vue 3 as a framework that excels in delivering high-performance, reactive, and efficient web applications.\nThe Composition API in Vue 3 represents a paradigm shift in how developers structure and organize their components compared to the Options API in Vue 2. Unlike the Options API, which separates concerns into distinct sections like \u201Cdata,\u201D \u201Ccomputed,\u201D and \u201Cmethods,\u201D the Composition API encourages a more composable and function-based approach. In Vue 2, data properties, computed properties, and methods are declared within an object, leading to potential verbosity and reduced modularity as the component grows. In contrast, the Composition API enables developers to use functions to create reusable logic and share stateful behavior across components more effectively. Let\u2019s consider a simple example:\nVue 2 Options API:\nVue 3 Composition API:\nIn this example, the Composition API introduces the \u201Cref\u201D function for reactive state and the \u201Ccomputed\u201D function for computed properties. This modular and function-centric approach simplifies code organization, promotes reusability, and enhances the overall maintainability of Vue components.The \u201C\u003Cscript setup\u003E\u201D syntax in Vue 3 further consolidates a component\u2019s state, props, and methods. It aims to streamline component composition, reducing boilerplate and improving code readability. Here\u2019s a quick example:\nThis concise syntax not only enhances the clarity of the code but also promotes a more ergonomic and efficient way of composing Vue components.\nVue 3 introduces several optimizations that significantly enhance rendering speed, facilitate tree-shaking, and result in smaller bundle sizes compared to Vue 2. The revamped Virtual DOM in Vue 3 is designed for improved rendering performance, reducing unnecessary updates and enhancing the efficiency of UI updates. This results in faster and more responsive applications, contributing to a smoother user experience. Moreover, Vue 3 incorporates enhanced tree-shaking capabilities, allowing for more efficient removal of unused code during the build process. This optimization translates to smaller bundle sizes, facilitating quicker loading times for web applications. The combination of these improvements positions Vue 3 as a powerful choice for developers seeking not only a more performant and reactive framework but also one that excels in minimizing the overall footprint of their applications.\nVue 3 also features enhanced TypeScript (TS) support, providing a more seamless integration with static typing. The improvements include better type inference for reactive properties, improved autocompletion, and overall stronger tooling support. This makes Vue 3 an ideal choice for developers who prefer TypeScript, ensuring a more robust development experience and improved code quality.\nMigrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3 can be approached through strategies like \u201Cone-step migration,\u201D where the entire codebase is upgraded to Vue 3 at once\u2014for smaller projects; or \u201Cincremental adoption,\u201D where developers can choose to migrate specific components or modules to Vue 3 while keeping the rest of the application in Vue 2\u2014for larger projects. Vue\u2019s official migration guide offers detailed steps and tools to facilitate a smooth transition based on project requirements.\nIn conclusion, the evolution from Vue 2 to Vue 3 brings forth a series of substantial improvements, ranging from architectural enhancements and the introduction of the Composition API to optimizations in rendering speed and reduced bundle sizes. Vue 3\u2019s improved TypeScript support further elevates its developer-friendly features.\nAs developers explore migration strategies tailored to their project needs, such as one-step migration or incremental adoption, Vue\u2019s commitment to facilitating a smooth transition ensures that the community can readily embrace the benefits of Vue 3 while building upon the success of Vue 2. This forward-looking framework not only addresses the challenges of modern web development but also empowers developers to create more performant, scalable, and maintainable applications.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"267","pageTitle":"CTRSTHMJDWRN","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-much-javascript-do-we-really-need/","text":"Choosing the Right Software Tools: How Much JavaScript Do We Really Need?\nSelecting the right software tools, languages, and frameworks is crucial for any software development project, especially when you are on a tight budget. In this blog post, we\u2019ll look into JavaScript specifically, which will be required to some degree with any website project. We\u2019ll explore when to choose between vanilla JavaScript, using Custom Web Elements, and JavaScript frameworks for web development.\nVanilla JavaScript refers to plain JavaScript without the use of any libraries or frameworks. At the time of writing, there is even a joke website for it here. Using Vanilla JavaScript is a great choice for/when:\nThe last few projects I have worked on personally at BizStream have had more focus on back-end functionality, which we have built as a team with C#. Also, there has not been much complexity needed on the front-end, so we decided to forego a JavaScript framework and improve our vanilla chops instead. For these simpler sites, it has been a good decision.\nCustom Web Elements (also known as Web Components) are a part of modern web development that allows you to create your own reusable HTML elements with encapsulated functionality and styling. They are an excellent choice when:\nI am a big fan of Custom Elements. One of their greatest features is that they can be used in all evergreen browsers, and you can use vanilla JavaScript to build them. In the same projects I mentioned above, there were cases where vanilla JavaScript was more cumbersome and complex to write. In these cases, we wrote Custom Web Elements with vanilla JavaScript to help us write simpler and more maintainable code. These complex cases included features like Paging for search results, custom tab controls, and carousels.\nRecently, the term \u201CHTML Web Components\u201D has been changing to refer to Custom Elements without utilizing the Shadow DOM. This is the way we have been using them at BizStream. This method also works extremely well when implementing custom Kentico Sections and Widgets that require JavaScript to function. There is a great article with other references about this emerging trend here.\nJavaScript frameworks provide pre-built structures and libraries to simplify web development. They shine in the following situations:\nThere have been several projects here at BizStream where we have chosen to use a JavaScript framework. All of these cases involved highly complex interactions, usually spanning across multiple pages containing complex state management.\nOne more thing to mention are Meta-frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby.js, SvelteKit, and Nuxt.js. They provide an additional layer of abstraction and simplification in web development. These frameworks offer the following benefits:\nMeta-frameworks can be a great choice when working with Kontent.ai or any headless CMS since they are not tied to a specific programming language or website architecture. So far at BizStream, we have used Kontent.ai with Gatsby.js and, more recently, Next.js.\nThere are other things to consider when choosing how to implement the front-end architecture of a website. If the site is eventually going to be maintained by the client, their environment has a heavy reliance on Microsoft IIS, and they mostly have C# developers, then building the site with ASP.NET should be considered before writing the site entirely in one of the meta-frameworks mentioned above. But, if they know JavaScript and/or Node development well, then writing with mostly JavaScript is probably the best.Another thing to think about is the project budget and the learning curve of using a larger framework or meta-framework. If no one has experience with Next.js and the budget is tight, it might pose too high of a risk to implement the site with it. On the other hand, if the budget allows the investment, frameworks, and meta-frameworks can be a joy to learn and work in.\nAt the end of the day, choosing the right software tools, languages, and approaches depends on the specific requirements of your web development project. JavaScript offers a wide range of possibilities, from simple, lightweight solutions with vanilla JavaScript and Web Components to complex, feature-rich applications with the help of JavaScript frameworks and meta-frameworks. You might not always want to reach for a framework or meta-framework when starting a new project, but they should not be disregarded either. To make the best decision, really learn what the options are, carefully consider the project\u2019s scale, complexity, and goals, and choose the approach that aligns with the development needs.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"270","pageTitle":"IBIUCCDE","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/integrating-branding-into-ux-ui/","text":"Integrating Branding into UX/UI: Crafting Cohesive Digital Experiences\nA brand serves as a company\u2019s fingerprint in the marketplace, setting it apart from competitors through a blend of differentiation, uniqueness, and identity. It encompasses various elements, including a company\u2019s name, logo, design, tone of voice, and essentially any feature that identifies the company to its consumers amidst a sea of alternatives. A strong brand is often steeped in a consistency that fosters recognition and trust, contributing substantially to a company\u2019s valuation and consumer allegiance.\nConcurrently, User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are pivotal facets in the digital realm that significantly influence a user\u2019s interaction with digital platforms, like websites and applications. UX refers to the overall feel and satisfaction a user derives from using a product, while UI is about the layout and visual elements that guide the user through the product. Their importance cannot be overstated as they can profoundly affect consumer satisfaction, brand perception, and, consequently, the company\u2019s bottom line.Transitioning to the interplay between branding and UX/UI, a synergistic blend of these components can lead to an emotional connection between a consumer and a company\u2019s brand. The aesthetics and interactiveness of UX/UI, when harmoniously integrated with the brand\u2019s essence, create a digital atmosphere that resonates with the consumer on a profound level. This harmonization not only elevates user engagement but infuses a sense of brand loyalty that can significantly augment the retention rate. As the digital sphere continues to be a primary point of interaction between companies and consumers, the fusion of branding with UX/UI is not a mere enhancement but an imperative strategy for companies aiming to thrive in the modern marketplace.\nCentral to the seamless integration of branding with UX/UI is an unwavering commitment to consistency, which forms the bedrock of a memorable digital identity. Each design facet, from the carefully chosen color palettes to the distinctive typography and the intuitive layout, should serve a dual purpose\u2014ensuring functionality while resonating with the brand\u2019s core identity. Take, for instance, a brand embodying the themes of \u201Cyouth\u201D and \u201Cvibrancy\u201D; the strategic choice of bright, contrasting colors, dynamic layouts, and bold typefaces is imperative. These elements, when harmoniously intertwined, serve as a continuous reinforcement of the brand ethos as users navigate through the digital platform. For example, the Google Store website showcases design consistency through its intuitive layout, harmonizing colors and fonts, and seamless navigation, making the shopping experience both pleasant and user-friendly.\nMoreover, such a meticulous design approach transcends mere aesthetics; it creates a resonant narrative that underscores the brand\u2019s identity, making every user interaction a brand-affirming experience. This strategic alignment between branding and UX/UI not only enriches the user experience but also morphs the digital platform into a potent conduit for brand communication. Ultimately, this consistency in design, reflecting the brand\u2019s core values, fosters a trustworthy and engaging platform that resonates with the target audience.\nCreating an emotional connection through UX/UI design is a profound tactic to foster brand perception and engagement, aiming to transcend a mere transactional user relationship. Utilizing design elements like colors and shapes can evoke a spectrum of emotions; for instance, a tranquil blue, often used in finance apps like PayPal, evokes trust and calmness, while an exciting red may stir urgency, often used in sales promotions. Beyond color, storytelling within design also forms a compelling pathway to engage emotions. Airbnb, for instance, masterfully employs storytelling in its UX/UI design, crafting a narrative through visuals and user journeys that echo the experiences and stories of hosts and travelers, making the platform more relatable and inspiring. Adobe\u2019s website skillfully creates an emotional connection, using vibrant imagery and interactive elements that evoke a sense of creativity and inspiration in its users.\nIncorporating human-centric imagery and micro-interactions further humanizes the user experience, adding a layer of empathy and engagement. Platforms like Slack create a playful, human-like environment with friendly illustrations and conversational micro-interactions, softening the formal corporate communication landscape. On a similar note, providing emotional feedback mechanisms, like Facebook\u2019s \u2018Reactions\u2019 feature, enables a personalized user interaction, allowing users to express emotions and engage on a deeper level. Through these nuanced design strategies, brands can foster a rich emotional connection, making the user experience more engaging, memorable, and aligned with the brand\u2019s core values and personality.\nTypography, which some mistakenly deem as a mere afterthought, actually wields significant power in translating a brand\u2019s essence. The subtleties in font choices can capture the intricacies of brand identity. Whether it\u2019s the refined elegance of a serif font chosen for a high-end luxury brand or the sleek simplicity of a sans-serif that resonates with a cutting-edge tech startup, the language of fonts speaks volumes. By thoughtfully and consistently applying specific fonts across all digital interfaces and marketing materials, businesses can underscore their brand\u2019s personality and promises.\nFigma\u2019s website effectively utilizes typography in its UX/UI design, employing clean, readable fonts that not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also improve the overall user experience by facilitating easy navigation and readability.\nMicrointeractions present another rich opportunity for embedding brand identity into UX/UI. These are the small, nuanced animations or design reactions that respond to user activity. The beauty of microinteractions lies in their ability to surprise and delight. A whimsical loading animation crafted in the brand\u2019s theme or cleverly written, brand-consistent error messages that bring out a brand\u2019s quirky personality not only enhance functionality but also turn routine interactions into memorable moments.\nThe Apple website enhances its UX/UI design with subtle yet impactful microinteractions, like animated buttons and responsive menus, that not only delight users but also provide intuitive feedback for a more engaging browsing experience.\nNavigating the diverse world of mobile UX/UI further adds layers of complexity to this branding challenge. With the myriad of screen sizes, resolutions, and operating systems, maintaining brand consistency can sometimes feel like navigating a maze. However, with advanced responsive design techniques and a laser-focused commitment to preserving brand aesthetics and feel across platforms, businesses can rise to this challenge, ensuring their brand feels at home regardless of the device.\nPayPal\u2019s mobile experience excels in UX/UI design by seamlessly incorporating its distinctive brand elements into a streamlined, user-friendly interface, which not only simplifies transactions but also reinforces brand identity, ensuring a secure and visually cohesive experience for its users.\nThe modern digital era is reshaping how branding is perceived and executed, blending traditional branding channels with digital platforms, thereby presenting businesses with a more intricate challenge. This evolving scenario underlines the crucial role of professional designers, who hold the key to successfully navigating this complex realm. With their rich experience, keen aesthetic eye, and deep understanding of user behavior across digital platforms, professional designers are adept at meticulously integrating branding into UX/UI design to significantly elevate user engagement and satisfaction. Their expertise ensures a seamless melding of brand identity with user-centric design, creating a coherent and engaging user experience. Furthermore, their adeptness in utilizing advanced design tools and staying updated with evolving design trends is invaluable. By fostering a well-crafted digital presence, professional designers help cultivate a form of brand loyalty that transcends beyond mere pixels, embedding the brand deeply into the hearts and minds of consumers. This not only creates a lasting impression but fosters a community of loyal customers, significantly bolstering the brand\u2019s market positioning and recall value. It is instrumental to weave the brand\u2019s essence intricately through the digital user experience, bridging the gap between functional expectations and profound brand loyalty.\nReady to amp up your digital presence?

They are all competing in a big area. A brand\u2019s identity is very important in this competition. It helps the brand stand out, connect with people, and make a good and lasting impression.\nBut when the market or the business changes, the brand\u2019s identity might not fit anymore. That\u2019s when a brand might think about rebranding, which is like starting over. Rebranding can include changing the brand\u2019s name, logo, look, message, and sometimes even its business strategy. This is especially true for businesses that have gone through big changes like mergers or are targeting new customers.\nHowever, not all brands need such a big change. There\u2019s a more delicate option called brand refinement. This is about making small adjustments to the brand without changing its core identity. It keeps the brand up-to-date with small changes in business strategy or customer preferences, making sure the brand stays relevant and appealing.\nRebranding and brand refinement are two ends of a spectrum, each with its own set of advantages and implications. A full rebranding is like a new dawn, a fresh start from a clean slate, which could be indispensable for brands facing substantial changes in their market dynamics. However, it is a hefty investment not just in financial terms but also in time and resources.\nOn the flip side, brand refinement is akin to a skilled potter molding and shaping the clay, making minor yet impactful tweaks to the existing design. It\u2019s about maintaining the brand\u2019s core identity while fine-tuning certain aspects to ensure resonance with the evolving market dynamics and consumer preferences. It\u2019s a more conservative, less disruptive, yet highly effective approach.\nThe decision between rebranding and brand refinement should stem from a well-rounded understanding of the brand\u2019s current position, the market dynamics, and the long-term business objectives. Brand refinement could be the strategic middle ground that revitalizes the brand while ensuring continuity and resonance in the marketplace. It\u2019s a testament to the adage, \u201CWhy fix what isn\u2019t broken?\u201D by choosing to refine and polish instead of overhauling entirely. This strategic middle ground could be the linchpin for fostering a brand\u2019s growth, resonance, and longevity in a competitive market scenario.\nWe\u2019d love to help you with your next branding project.

{"id":"273","pageTitle":"ZTTNBTOJTLB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/zero-trust-the-next-big-thing-or-just-the-latest-buzzword/","text":"Zero Trust: The Next Big Thing or Just the Latest Buzzword?\nIf there\u2019s one thing the tech world has in abundance, it\u2019s buzzwords. If our servers thrived on buzzwords, we\u2019d be powering the entire global server ecosystem for centuries. Okay, maybe that\u2019s a bit of a stretch, but you get the idea.\nEnter the latest buzzword on the block: Zero Trust. Now, here\u2019s the thing\u2014Zero Trust means many things to many different people/vendors in the tech realm. Ask five vendors about their Zero Trust product, and you\u2019re likely to get five different answers, a toolkit that resembles a tech wizard\u2019s dream, and likely a price tag to fit that dream. So, let\u2019s roll up our sleeves and dig into Zero Trust\u2014at least, what it means to BizStream and what it could mean for you and your company.\nAt its core, Zero Trust is essentially saying, \u201CJust because a device is on a \u2018trusted network\u2019\u2014you know, your in-house corporate Wi-Fi with all those nifty monitoring systems and high-end firewalls\u2014doesn\u2019t automatically mean it should be there or that it\u2019s safe.\u201D This helps your security model by flipping the script to verify and then trust. I choose to think of it as a security framework. Once I have that, I can find the tool to match my needs.\nWhen I dove into this Zero Trust rabbit hole and quickly realized that everyone had their own spin on it, I decided I needed to carve out what I was aiming for. Here\u2019s the rough sketch I came up with:We need a better way to grant secure access to our legacy network and cloud resources from devices we may not own and networks we may not control.Man, that is like a mission statement or something. I kid, but this really helped as I talked to vendors to find the right tool/software.\nSo, after researching and talking with vendors, I came up with the following \u201Cquestion\u201D to build my Zero Trust framework upon. Should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource? It might not sound revolutionary if you\u2019ve been around tech for a while, but it helped me frame what I was looking for, more context around that control.\nI may have gone a bit rogue with the implementation, though, not just logically separating my network traffic (VLANS) but physically separating them too. Picture this\u2014when our team strolls into the office, the Wi-Fi network is just another network. It\u2019s got zero connection or context to our core. We\u2019re using a next-gen Zero Trust application that lets us answer that crucial question: should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource?\nNow, armed with all this info, I can toss it into a risk matrix of sorts to decide whether to grant the request. This helps the company leadership, and me understand the risk we are introducing with our access. Maybe the data is highly sensitive, and I only want to grant that access with additional security measures in place, like forcing an MFA challenge. The added bonus is that the framework is now applied to all of my networks. We can layer on extra security to legacy networks that lack MFA or need additional security with very little effort. We can route traffic after security challenges have been met without complicated firewall rules.\nSo, there you have it\u2014Zero Trust in action at BizStream. It\u2019s not just a tech buzzword; it\u2019s a framework that reshapes how we approach security. By adding layers of context and separating the physical and logical realms, we\u2019re navigating the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity with a sharper focus.\nIn a world where technology evolves at warp speed, Zero Trust isn\u2019t just a tool, a buzzword, or a framework; it\u2019s a mindset shift. It\u2019s about questioning assumptions and ensuring that access isn\u2019t just a given but earned through a calculated evaluation. As we embrace the future of cybersecurity, buzzwords, and ever-changing threat models, one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014trust may be a rare commodity, but with the right approach, it\u2019s the backbone of a secure digital frontier.\nWant to talk about it more?

{"id":"276","pageTitle":"4LPMCGFAR","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/4-lessons-project-managers-can-gain-from-adventure-racing/","text":"4 Lessons Project Managers Can Gain from Adventure Racing\nIn early September, my good friend (also named Josh) and I embarked on our inaugural Adventure Race in Northern Michigan. At BizStream, we champion the motto that \u201Cit\u2019s good to do hard things,\u201D so naturally, we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It did not disappoint!\nThe race encompassed a combination of trekking, canoeing, and mountain biking, demanding a fusion of strategic planning, stress management, and determination, all within the framework of light-hearted competition. The experience mirrored the dynamics of initiating a new project at BizStream in many ways. Reflecting on this day, I\u2019ve distilled several key insights that have enriched my perspective and honed my skills as a Project Manager.\nAt the start of the race, participants are provided with a map pinpointing various checkpoints. In our case, the challenge involved navigating 18 checkpoints scattered across a 5-mile radius, all within a stringent 5-hour time limit. This is about the point when your heart starts beating a little faster, and the nerves start to kick in. What did I get myself into?When you spin up a new project, the same set of emotions can oftentimes run parallel. Nothing works more effectively at triggering a full-blown panic attack than a fresh backlog with 400 User Stories and an aggressive deadline.Stay calm. You got this.The initial step is meticulous planning, mapping out each phase of the project, similar to plotting a course from one checkpoint to the next. Opt for a path that harmonizes efficiency with productivity.It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. Just as the human body is not designed for a 5-hour sprint, a team cannot operate at maximum capacity out of the gate to the end. Focus on completing the initial sprint effectively, refining the process as needed, and then advancing with the knowledge gained.\nThroughout my career, I have read numerous books and blogs penned by \u201Cseasoned Project Managers.\u201D Indeed, knowledge is a power in a way, but it\u2019s equally important to trust your own intuition.During the race, we faced decisions on how to approach each segment (Trek, Canoe, Bike) and the order in which to tackle them. Initially, we contemplated starting with the trek, given its challenging checkpoints, which could potentially offer us a late-game advantage. This was what our gut was telling us. However, swayed by the majority, we opted to begin with biking, as it seemed to be the popular choice among other teams. We followed the herd.I learned that when all 36 teams are simultaneously bike-sprinting through the forest, it can lead to some pretty nasty bottlenecks. We ran into a lot of other people fighting for the same checkpoints. It may have looked like the path of least resistance, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily what was best for our race strategy. This parallels project management, where choosing the easiest tasks or the most apparent route isn\u2019t always the most effective strategy. Tackling significant features early on can efficiently address dependencies, making future sprints much easier.At one point in our race, we inadvertently started following another canoe. Little did we know that this particular canoe was a part of the 8-hour racing team (a completely different race), and they were headed toward a checkpoint that was not even on our map. This mistake, which cost us about 9 minutes as we struggled against the current to backtrack, underscored the importance of trusting our intuition rather than blindly following others. Trust your gut.\nWe had a considerable lead on the other teams as we entered the race\u2019s final leg: the trek. We hit the trail at a sprint, victory within grasp. Our hope was that we would see the flag from the trail (it looked that way on the map, anyway). Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case. We didn\u2019t pick a great starting point and neglected to get a proper bearing from our first position. Relying on hope rather than strategy, we missed the crucial first checkpoint and found ourselves retracing our steps back to the start. After losing 15 minutes, we made the decision to forgo that first checkpoint and return to it later. This choice was a testament to our ability to prioritize and manage time effectively, opting to cut our losses rather than persist in a fruitless search.This experience draws a parallel to project management, particularly in the initial stages. Establishing a strong foundation for your first project sprint is crucial. It\u2019s essential to carefully consider which tasks to undertake first to set the stage for future success. The eagerness to dive into the work is understandable, but the pre-production phase, in my opinion, determines the project\u2019s ultimate success. It lays the groundwork for everything that follows, so it\u2019s imperative not to overlook this planning phase.\nRaw skills will only get you so far. This goes for both you and your team. Relying solely on a team of top-tier senior developers, often regarded as \u2018rock stars\u2019 in the tech world, is a misconception that can actually complicate matters for a Project Manager.Both Josh and I workout pretty consistently (yay, CrossFit), and while our fitness level was certainly an asset, it occasionally proved to be a double-edged sword. We found ourselves over-relying on our physical strength and stamina, mistakenly believing it to be our ace in the hole. However, stamina is futile without direction, and even your greatest strengths can become liabilities if you lack a strategic plan.In a race that requires both speed and endurance and strategic, educated, and coordinated moves, brute force alone is insufficient. Adventure Racing, much like complex projects, demands a slower, more thoughtful approach. It\u2019s crucial to utilize a blend of skills, not just technical prowess.This lesson is particularly pertinent in project management. Even the most seasoned developers can falter by overcomplicating or under-delivering solutions in the absence of a well-thought-out plan. Thus, it\u2019s imperative to take the time to plan and rely on more than just technical skills to navigate a project successfully.\nDid you count the total time wasted based on our mistakes? It was 24 minutes. The hard-to-swallow realization is the narrow margin by which we missed a podium finish; we were a mere 12 minutes shy of landing a top-three position. Any one of those mistakes could have been the difference between victory and our actual placement of 5th. I had a blast, don\u2019t get me wrong. However, the thought lingers: with just a bit more experience, a deeper understanding of the race dynamics, and perhaps a more strategic approach, we could have secured a top-three placement.\nSo remember:\nThe advice from a seasoned 1st Assistant Director during my time in the film industry left a lasting impression: the importance of making a strong impression in the last week of work. This period is crucial as it tends to be what people remember and can significantly influence future opportunities. \u201CDon\u2019t screw up that last week,\u201D he cautioned, \u201Cit determines if you land that next gig or not.\u201DThis concept resonates deeply in project management as well. Often, the successes achieved during a project\u2019s initial and middle stages are overshadowed if the final phase is mishandled. A project that is 90% successful but falters during launch is often perceived as a failure. The final moments, particularly any missteps, tend to linger in the customers\u2019 memories, overshadowing earlier achievements. This unfortunate emphasis on the endgame can sometimes lead to the team not fully appreciating or celebrating the project\u2019s completion as they should.Recognizing and celebrating each victory along the way is essential. If a sprint is successful, it should be acknowledged and celebrated. Simple gestures like encouragement, praise, or team lunches can significantly impact morale. At BizStream, for instance, we use Officevibe to express gratitude and recognize the team\u2019s hard work. While keeping an eye on the overall project goals, it\u2019s also vital to appreciate and commend the team\u2019s efforts in real time. This balanced approach ensures morale remains high and the team feels valued throughout the project lifecycle, not just at the end.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"280","pageTitle":"BCNCFCMC","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/beyond-custommodules-naming-conventions-for-clear-maintainable-code/","text":"Beyond CustomModules: Naming Conventions for Clear, Maintainable Code\nProgramming is much more than creating instructions for a computer. Coding is where logic meets language, and as with any written language, there are principles that should be followed. Whether it\u2019s a variable, a function, a class, or a module, the name you assign to it carries the weight of understanding for fellow developers and even for your future self. It has been said that programming is 20 percent coding and 80 percent figuring out what to name things. This seemingly simple act profoundly shapes the clarity, readability, and maintainability of our code. Proper naming can transform lines of code into eloquent expressions of logic and purpose. Each language has its own preferred naming paradigms chosen by the authors. For this post, I\u2019m going to focus on C#.\nThe module name should clearly describe the functionality it provides. A developer should be able to understand what the module does without having to look into its code. And by all means, never call it a CustomModule.\nAlways use PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized) for module names. Consistency is essential for readability.\nWhile brevity is important, avoid overly cryptic abbreviations that might confuse other developers. Use meaningful words that convey the module\u2019s purpose.\nClass names and object instances should generally be named using nouns or noun phrases that represent the entities they represent\u2014for example, \u2018Customer\u2019, \u2018Order\u2019.\nTry to keep the module name concise while being descriptive. Long module names can become unwieldy and more challenging to read. Aim for a balance between clarity and brevity.\nEstablish a naming convention for your project and stick to it. Consistency in naming modules, variables, and other elements across your codebase enhances readability and maintainability.\nChoose module names that fit logically within the namespace hierarchy. This helps in organizing and structuring your codebase.\nEnsure that module names are unique within the scope of your project to avoid naming conflicts. This becomes especially important when working on larger projects or collaborating with other developers. Oh, and don\u2019t call your module CustomModule.\nChoose between singular and plural form based on whether the class represents a single object or a collection of objects. For example, use \u2018User\u2019\u00A0for a class representing a single user and Users for a class representing multiple users.\nAgain, PascalCase is the preferred naming for properties. For example, \u2018UserSettings\u2019, \u2018HasChildren\u2019.\nLocal variables are typically named using camelCase, where the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words are capitalized. For example: \u2018totalCount\u2019, \u2018customerName\u2019.\nConstants are often named using uppercase letters with underscores separating words. For example, \u2018MAX_VALUE\u2019, \u2018DEFAULT_PATH\u2019. Note: this is a heated debate among developers who argue that PascalCase is the way.\nChoose descriptive and meaningful names so that someone reading your code can understand the purpose of the variable without needing to refer to additional documentation. Avoid using generic names like \u2018temp\u2019, \u2018data\u2019, or single-letter names like \u2018x\u2019.\nWhile keeping names concise is important, abbreviations and acronyms can sometimes make code less understandable. Use abbreviations sparingly and only when they are well-known and widely recognized.\nIn some cases, it\u2019s helpful to use prefixes or suffixes to indicate the purpose or type of a variable or method. For example: \u2018isComplete\u2019 , \u2018hasData\u2019.\nAvoid using Hungarian notation (prefixing variable names with type indicators) as it\u2019s no longer considered a best practice in modern C# development.\nConsistency in naming is crucial. Use the same naming conventions throughout your codebase to maintain readability and reduce confusion. You can use whatever you want, but make sure it remains consistent.\nMethods typically perform actions, so their names should reflect what they do. Use a verb or a verb phrase to describe the action followed by a noun representing the object acted upon. \u2018GetDocuments()\u2019\nAlways use PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized) for module names.\nChoose method names that clearly convey the purpose of the method. A developer should understand the method\u2019s functionality just by looking at its name. For Example, \u2018FetchDataFromDatabase()\u2019, \u2018CreateUserFromContact()\u2019\nWhile brevity is important, avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that are not widely known. Code should be understandable by anyone, not just the original developer.\nProper naming conventions cannot be overstated in the realm of programming. Remember, clear and meaningful names significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of your code. By adhering to these guidelines (remember they are just guidelines), you create a codebase that is not only functional but also understandable. A thoughtfully named variable, method, or module allows you to spend less time writing documentation and more time coding.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"281","pageTitle":"3NCFYCUIPRN","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-new-css-features-you-can-use-in-production-right-now/","text":"3 New CSS Features You Can Use In Production Right Now\nHow many times as a developer have you been excited about the announcement of a new CSS feature just to go to caniuse.com to find out that it isn\u2019t supported by one of the major browsers? Well, don\u2019t worry, this is not one of those blog posts. I am going to outline a few new CSS features that are either supported by the major browsers, are progressive enhancements, or have graceful fallbacks that are easily implemented. All that to say, you can use any of the features in a production environment safely!\nThis is one that I personally am very happy has been added to CSS. The nth-child syntax now provides a keyword \u201Cof\u201D, which can be used like so: :nth-child(2 of .my-class). This will first find all the elements with .my-class and select the second occurrence of that class. As opposed to .my-class:nth-child(2), which would select an element with .my-class that is also the second child. As a developer of websites using content management systems, this can be very useful. One use case of this feature is when you need to target the second occurrence of a class that is on a widget/component. However, you don\u2019t know where or how the content editor is going to nest this widget within other content. Now you can easily target the second occurrence of that class, with the nth-of syntax.\nText-wrap now has a new value available, balance. With text-wrap: balance, the browser will calculate the best way to wrap text in an element so that all the lines are \u201Cbalanced\u201D. In other words, each line of text will have similar lengths. Right now, text-wrap: balance only works with up to 4 lines of text, so it is best reserved for headings or content that you are confident won\u2019t span more than 4 lines at any given viewport width. In addition, text-wrap: balance is not yet supported by Firefox or Safari, but this is a progressive enhancement. So if a user is on either of those browsers, it will just appear as if that property wasn\u2019t used. The example below shows an example of text-wrap: balance in action. The first heading has text-wrap: balance applied, while the second one does not.\nSee the Pen \ntext-wrap: balance by Tyler Stirtz (@Tyler-Stirtz)\non CodePen.\nContainer queries allow developers to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element\u2019s container. This allows you to hide/show content or change the layout based on the size of a parent element. In order to use container queries, you must specify an element as a container using the container-type property. The container-type property has three possible values, size, inline-size, and normal. Refer to the MDN docs for an explanation of each value. Once a containment context has been created, you can use the @container\u00A0at-rule to create a container query. Think of the container query just like media queries, but instead of basing the query on the viewport size, it\u2019s based on the specified containment element\u2019s size. The example below shows the text getting smaller as the container gets smaller.\nSee the Pen \nContainer Queries by Tyler Stirtz (@Tyler-Stirtz)\non CodePen.\nCredit to Una Kravets, Bramus, and Adam Argyle at developer.chrome.com for outlining the new features in CSS for 2023. If you would like to see all the new features, not just the ones that are supported by all browsers currently, head over here.\nAlso, keep an eye out on web.dev, developer.chrome.com, and MDN for Baseline, the new initiative Google rolled out this year. The goal of Baseline is to easily show developers whether a feature is supported and safe to use in a production environment.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

After all, when you choose an agency to design and build your project, you\u2019re starting a long-term relationship that may last months or years. After carefully crafting your RFP and meeting with potential agencies, you finally receive proposals. One of them stands out, the one with the highest price tag out of all the proposals you received. When faced with a proposal that\u2019s significantly higher than the rest, how do you proceed?\nFirst, whatever you do, avoid deciding solely based on lower cost estimates without thoroughly examining the higher proposal. This due diligence could save you from challenging conversations about unexpected costs and shifting expectations in the future.\nIn our experience, disparities in cost estimation are often due to the following:\nIt\u2019s essential to examine both lower and higher cost estimates and the context behind them. It\u2019s crucial for your project\u2019s success to understand the differences between the proposals fully.\nIn-depth conversations with both higher and lower-cost agencies will help to:\nWe suggest starting conversations with the agency that provided the higher proposed cost for the project. A thorough discussion with the agency will help you to understand the reasoning behind their project cost estimation. It\u2019s crucial for your project\u2019s success to fully understand why this quote stands out.\nBefore diving into discussions with potential agencies, it\u2019s important to do your homework. Coming to the table with a clear understanding of your project\u2019s needs and expectations not only demonstrates professionalism but also ensures that the conversation is productive from the get-go. Being prepared minimizes the back-and-forth, streamlines the decision-making process, and helps position yourself as a well-informed client.\nBe transparent, genuine, and eager to learn. Clearly communicate your objective to establish a budget that ensures project success and a long-term relationship.\nExpressing your concerns prior to the meeting will encourage the agency to critically review your project and come prepared to discuss your queries.\nProvide the agency context on where their proposal differs significantly from the others.\nMaintain a sincere, open dialogue and a willingness to learn. Engage actively and consider posing these questions:\nOnce you\u2019ve gained valuable insights from the agency offering the higher proposal, it\u2019s equally important to communicate these insights to the agencies that provided lower estimates. A discussion with these agencies can shed light on any differences in their understanding of the project, and it also gives them an opportunity to revise their quotes if necessary.\nYour approach when meeting with lower-cost agencies should be as meticulous and inquisitive as with the higher-quoted one. Here are some essential questions to consider:\nThe process of selecting the right design and development agency goes beyond just the numbers on a proposal. It\u2019s about understanding the depth, expertise, and value each agency brings to the table. While a higher bid might initially seem daunting, it may represent a more accurate, comprehensive, and ultimately successful approach to your project. On the other hand, lower bids may offer a price advantage but require a deeper dive to ensure there are no hidden pitfalls. Remember, the goal isn\u2019t to find the cheapest or the most expensive agency but the one that aligns best with your project\u2019s vision, scope, and long-term objectives. By fostering open communication, asking the right questions, and critically evaluating each proposal, you\u2019ll be well-equipped to make an informed decision that sets your project up for success.\nReady to start a project?

{"id":"283","pageTitle":"MK1T1CME","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/making-kentico-12-to-13-content-migrations-easier/","text":"Making Kentico 12 to 13 Content Migrations Easier\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of digital experience platforms, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements is of utmost importance! In this blog post, we\u2019ll navigate the transition process from Kentico 12 to Kentico 13, uncovering strategies, tools, and insights that will empower you to migrate content while upgrading your site. If you\u2019re a developer, content administrator, solution architect, or business owner, get ready to unlock the secrets to making your Kentico 12 to 13 content migrations a breeze, ensuring your digital presence remains up-to-date with as little interference as possible.\nMigrating content between different versions of a digital platform can be a complex undertaking, and Kentico 12 to 13 migrations are no exception. In this section, we\u2019ll establish the ground rules that will serve as the foundation for your migration process.\nOur migration journey encompasses various elements, ranging from custom tables and content tree items/pages to settings and resource strings. The goal is to ensure a complete transition of your content and configurations. However, it\u2019s important to note that the content you wish to migrate must be accessible through the Kentico API. This criterion ensures that the migration process can interact with and extract the necessary data from the source Kentico 12 database.\nWhile the migration process covers a wide spectrum of content types, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge that content cannot be directly migrated into Kentico 13 widgets. Widgets, being a distinct and dynamic feature of Kentico 13, require a different integration approach. As such, our migration focus lies on other content elements within the platform.\nTo execute a successful migration, you must have access to both the source database of your Kentico 12 instance and the destination database of Kentico 13. These databases contain the relevant information that needs to be extracted and imported during the migration process. When running migrations in development, I recommend having backups and local copies of the source and destination databases. That way, if there is ever a need to restore either database to its pre-migratory state, it can be done simply using a SQL tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).\nA reliable tech stack is essential when embarking on the journey of migrating content from Kentico 12 to 13. Visual Studio 2022 stands as the cornerstone IDE of our tech stack. We use Visual Studio 2022 for its usefulness in managing NuGet packages, project secrets, debugging, unit testing, etc.\nC# emerges as the programming language of choice for driving the migrations, establishing database connections, and mapping models from old to new.\nFinally, the role of (SSMS) is crucial. This tool enables you to interact with the source and destination databases, executing queries, inspecting data, and managing database schema. SQL queries are the backbone of the export process in these migrations.\nThroughout this guide, we\u2019ll use specific terminology to distinguish between the stages of migration. The process of extracting information from the Kentico 12 \u201Csource\u201D database will be referred to as the \u201Cexport\u201D process. Conversely, the process of inserting this information into the new Kentico 13 \u201Cdestination\u201D database will be referred to as the \u201Cimport\u201D process. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the migration steps with clarity and confidence.\nIn the following sections, we\u2019ll delve deeper into the intricacies of each migration stage, providing insights and strategies to ensure a smooth transition from Kentico 12 to 13.\nBefore undertaking any coding efforts, it is beneficial to discuss with your team and/or clients about what content needs to be migrated from the old Kentico 12 site. Creating a full list of custom tables, settings, resource strings, page types, and other content will be essential to establishing a migration scope and strategy.\nNow that you have a grasp on individual items that need to be migrated, you can get started with your first migration! Start by cloning the BizStream Migrations Repository from GitHub. We\u2019ll be working directly with the source code there to create a comprehensive command-line script for your migratory needs. If you\u2019re interested in a fast-tracked lesson, you can check out the feature/blog-post branch, which has the code updates outlined in the rest of this blog.\nThe example migration that we\u2019ll be following today details the migration of \u201CArticle\u201D pages from the K12 site to K13. The \u201CCMS.Article\u201D page type is built-in and has these content fields in Kentico 12:\nA few things we\u2019ll need to ask ourselves before heading over into the source code are:\n1. Will our new page type have the same fields in the new site? If not, what will be the differences between those fields?\nFor the sake of simplicity, our example migration will have the same fields/field types in the new site\u2019s \u201CArticle\u201D page type. The only thing we will change is the page type name, to \u201CMySite.Article\u201D\n2. Do we want ALL of the \u201CCMS.Article\u201D pages from the old site to be migrated? If not, how can we filter the articles down to only the ones that we want?\nLet\u2019s assume that there are hundreds, even thousands, of articles on the old site. Some of them date back to almost 10 years ago! Some clients may specify that they only want to bring over articles created in the last 3 years (2020 or later). This is important information to consider during the export process! For this sample case, we\u2019ll be migrating all articles.\n3. Where do we want all of the Articles to end up in the content tree on the new site?\nLet\u2019s assume that the articles in the old site are organized by year as follows:\nWe want articles to migrate to the new site in the same structure: organized under a \u201Cyear\u201D folder. Those \u201Cyear\u201D folders will be under a parent folder called \u201CArticles.\u201D\nNow that we\u2019ve squared away some important questions about the scope of our migration, let\u2019s take a look at the new site. First things first, we\u2019ll need to build out our \u201CArticle\u201D page type here, with the same fields and field types as on the old site. Here\u2019s how I\u2019m naming mine:\nAs expressed before, we add the same fields to this page type as on the old page type:\nFinally, make sure you choose \u201CCMS.Folder\u201D as an allowed parent type:\nNow your page type is all set up and ready to go on your new site. Before we continue any further, though, make sure that you are able to add an article under a folder in the content tree. Additionally, go ahead and create the parent folder for all of our articles in the content tree:\nNow we have completed the necessary steps to get our new Kentico instance prepared for the article migration. It\u2019s time to dig into some code!\nAs stated earlier, you\u2019ll first want to clone the BizStream Migrations Repository down to your local machine. Make sure this machine has sufficient access to the source and destination sites\u2019 databases before continuing!\nInside the repository, you\u2019ll find a Visual Studio solution file named Migrations.sln. Open that up to see the project\u2019s files!\nI\u2019ll begin by recommending that you read/keep open the project\u2019s README.md file, as I will be following its setup steps exactly as described, providing insight as we go along.\nFirst, I rebuilt my Kentico 13 web app\u2019s CMSApp.csproj project to make sure everything in my Kentico instance is up-to-date.\nSecond, we need to add our database connection strings. I created connectionStrings.config at the root of the repository and copy-pasted the skeleton code from the Readme:\nI then replaced the connection string with that of my Kentico 13 (destination) database. If you\u2019re wondering where to find this connection string, the easiest place would be to check your web application\u2019s CMS/Web.config file.\nNext, we need to add our source connection string. Once again, I followed the Readme and added a user secret to the project by copy-pasting the skeleton code and changing out the connection string:\nNow that you\u2019ve added database connection strings, we can dive deeper into the code base. Before we do, make sure the project successfully builds and when you run it, you see a terminal open that looks like this (You might have to hit \u201CEnter\u201D if there isn\u2019t any text showing):\nLet\u2019s add a new migration option for our Articles. Remember to follow along with the Readme open.\nFirst, we\u2019ll add the generated code to our solution for the Article page type that we created in Kentico 13. Under Models/PageTypes, I simply created a Article.generated.cs and copy-pasted the page type code straight from Kentico into that file:\nNote: If you already have generated Kentico models in another class library, just add that library as a reference to this project, and you can use the code from there!\nTo retrieve data from the Kentico 12 database, let\u2019s create a SQL query. There are a few fields that are absolutely necessary to retrieve because we are using these fields to insert into the new database through the Kentico API. These fields are:\nGiven this information, we can craft a basic query:\nWe query against View_CMS_Tree_Joined because it contains all of those required TreeNode fields we identified above. This is all great, but we also need information specific to our Article page type! To get those columns, we just need to join on the Article table:\nMy results from this query are:\nAside from the obvious lazy replication of data for this test scenario, this looks like everything we need to continue with our migration!Note: For the sake of simplicity, I will be disregarding the content of the ArticleTeaserImage column for the rest of this example. There certainly are ways to successfully migrate images, but it requires extra migratory steps to download/upload images to and from both instances of Kentico.\nAbove is the generated model for importing data into Kentico 13. Our code will eventually map data from the old site to this final model before inserting a new node in the tree. However, we need a model for the data from the old site (hint: for this use case, since no field names change, they will basically be the same models!)Add a model class for the data we\u2019ll be pulling in from the old site. The model looks simple:\nAs you can see, we\u2019re inheriting from the TreeNodeModel class because that class has a few fields that are common between all page types (TreeNodes) and are necessary when inserting pages/nodes through the Kentico API. You may also be confused as to why we\u2019ve omitted the \u201CArticleName\u201D field. That is because we are using \u201CArticleName\u201D as the page name source for the Article page type. This causes the database representation of Articles to store the value of \u201CArticleName\u201D in a field called \u201CNodeName\u201D instead, which is common between all TreeNodes.The \u201CNodeName\u201D field is seen in \u201CTreeNodeModel\u201D, so we\u2019re covered for that field.\nLet\u2019s now add a new repository file under /Repositories called ArticleRepository.cs. The repository files are used to define and abstract the retrieval and insertion of data from databases.\nThe important parts here are in the class inheritance signature. Our ArticleRepository is a SqlToTreeNodeRepository, meaning it retrieves data from a SQL query and converts that data to a TreeNode to be inserted into the Kentico content tree. Moreover, it is a SqlToTreeNodeRepository\u003CArticleModel, Article\u003E, so it will convert the results of our SQL query into an ArticleModel (using a C# package called Dapper), map that model to an Article (using another C# package called AutoMapper), then insert that Article into the Kentico 13 content tree according to the \u201CInsert\u201D function defined in SqlToTreeNodeRepository. Check out the inheritance hierarchy and base methods to get a better understanding of what\u2019s happening under the hood.Before moving on to the next step, make sure you paste in your SQL Query.\nWe\u2019ll now define an AutoMapper mapping profile for mapping from our ArticleModel to an Article. To do so, we\u2019ll add a new ArticleMappingProfile.cs under /Mappings:\nSince our ArticleModel and Article page type have the same field names, AutoMapper can figure out which field maps to which between the two types, allowing us to have a very simple mapping declaration. For more information on how AutoMapper profiles work, check out their documentation.\nFinally, we\u2019ll add a ArticlesMigrator.cs class under /Migrators:\nThe [Migrator(MigrationOptions.Articles)] attribute registers this migrator into the terminal and tells the application to call this migrator\u2019s Migrate() method if its corresponding option is selected in the terminal.\nWe\u2019re done adding code for article migrations! Make sure your solution builds, run it, select Articles in the terminal, and hit \u201Center\u201D! But wait\u2026 I\u2019m getting this error:\nThe parent nodes for these articles can\u2019t be found in the Kentico 13 content tree because they don\u2019t exist! Remember, each article needs to be placed under a folder with the year the article was published, just like in the old site! Let\u2019s take a quick look at the ParentNodeAliasPath field of our articles in our SQL query:\nTwo things: our new site\u2019s main folder has a NodeAlias of \u201CArticles,\u201D\u00A0not \u201CTEST-Articles,\u201D\u00A0and none of the \u201Cyear\u201D folders exist under the new site\u2019s \u201CArticles\u201D folder! We need to migrate those folders before we migrate our News Articles. The good thing is that we can add that migration to happen inside of our ArticleMigrator.cs. Let\u2019s do that real quick, following the steps from the Readme again:\n1. Add the Folder generated page type: it already exists\n2. Create a SQL Query to grab folders from the old site, but format the alias paths to be accurate for the new site:\n3. Add a FolderModel in /Models: it already exists!\n4. Add a new repository for the specific folders we\u2019re migrating. Note: There is an existing FolderRepository that we can inherit from to make our lives even easier:\n5. Copy-Paste in the SQL Query from Step 2.\n6. Add a mapping profile for Folders: it already exists!\n7. Add a new MigrationOption: we don\u2019t need to since we\u2019re combining this migration under the Articles option!\n8. Add a new Migrator: we don\u2019t need to since we\u2019re combining this migration with our existing ArticlesMigrator!\n9. Add the new repository with constructor dependency injection to our ArticlesMigrator, and call its methods from Migrate():\nThat was the last step for folders! If I run the migration now, here\u2019s what I see:\nSure enough, the content tree shows that the folders all migrated successfully:\nBut, we have just one final step: our original SQL Query for articles has incorrect NodeAliasPath and ParentNodeAliasPath values:\nSo let\u2019s update our query to replace all instances of \u201CTEST-Articles\u201D with \u201CArticles\u201D:\nMake sure to copy-paste this query into the ArticleRepository, then rebuild. Before running our migration again, let\u2019s make sure to delete all of the \u201Cyear\u201D folders from the content tree so we don\u2019t end up with duplicates.\nUpon running the migration one final time, here are the results:\nOur articles are all there!\nAs we conclude our exploration of Kentico migrations, it\u2019s evident that the process is not just a straightforward transition but rather an intricate journey that demands patience and iterative development. Particularly for extensive use cases such as migrating product-related information like SKUs, the journey resembles a trial-and-error expedition where adaptability and persistence are key.\nMigrating content requires an approach that goes beyond the technical stack. It\u2019s about understanding the nuances of your data, understanding the capabilities of the Kentico API, and recognizing the unique challenges each migration can bring. The trial-and-error nature of the process means that unforeseen issues might arise, requiring adjustments, optimizations, and sometimes a complete overhaul of the initial strategy.\nSo, as you embark on your own Kentico migration adventure, remember that it\u2019s not just about moving data from one place to another; it\u2019s about adapting to the unexpected, refining your methods, and ultimately achieving a seamless transition that preserves the essence of your content while embracing the capabilities of the future. With patience and diligence, you\u2019ll navigate through content migrations with ease and emerge with happy clients!\nAre you looking to upgrade to Xperience by Kentico from Kentico 13?

{"id":"284","pageTitle":"4TMSFPM","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/4-time-management-strategies-for-project-managers/","text":"4 Time Management Strategies for Project Managers\nEffective time management is a crucial skill that empowers project managers to navigate the complexities of web projects, whether that be through a discovery or implementation. By adopting proven time management strategies, project managers can optimize their productivity, meet deadlines, support their teams, and achieve successful outcomes. In this blog post, we will explore essential time management techniques that will elevate your project management game and pave the way for project success.\nThis may seem like a very obvious place to start, but experience has taught me how critical To-Do list management is to overall project health. Effective To-Do lists allow you to keep track of needed activity, prioritize your work, and ensure that the client and your project team have what they need to be informed and successful. I recommend focusing on high-impact, time-sensitive tasks first and using a tool that you will actually stick to for managing these tasks. A checklist on your desk can be great, but I like using a personal JIRA board for my task management. There are tons of tools out there that can be used, so look for a solution that fits you best!\nPlanning and resourcing a project is the de facto task that describes the average day\u2019s work for a project manager. This can be difficult, however, when pulling together schedules that span multiple teams, companies, and time zones. While it may be easier to plan sprint rituals and meetings on a more ad hoc basis, taking the time to coordinate calendars, set clear expectations with all parties involved, and laying out scheduled plans with recurring meetings goes a long way in ensuring your overall sanity.\nIf making all those meetings and sessions happen across so many people is difficult, don\u2019t be afraid to have tough conversations about prioritization and the importance of a regular cadence of meetings. If expectations need to shift, that\u2019s okay too. Get everyone on the same page, though, and make sure the plan is agreed upon by all.\nStrong and transparent communication is essential for project success. Regularly communicate with your team, stakeholders, and clients to ensure everyone is aligned. Share project updates, discuss challenges, and provide clear expectations. Effective communication fosters collaboration, prevents misunderstandings, and promotes a supportive team environment.\nAt BizStream, we believe there should never be surprises regarding project status and budget. Transparency expedites and invigorates decision-making. It builds trust. It allows decision-makers to do what they do best. Communicating as soon as possible, with clarity and decisiveness, can help secure ongoing project health.\nTime-blocking is a powerful technique for optimizing focus and productivity. Allocate specific time blocks for different tasks, such as meetings, focused work, and communication. Protect these time blocks from interruptions and distractions. By dedicating uninterrupted chunks of time to important tasks, you\u2019ll enhance your focus and efficiency.\nBy adopting these time management techniques, project managers will be better equipped to navigate through projects, meet deadlines, and deliver outstanding results. Remember, time management is a valuable asset that allows PMs to lead their teams with efficiency and achieve remarkable results in every project. Find what works for you, and as with all things project-related, don\u2019t be afraid to change it up as you learn more.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"285","pageTitle":"HBEDGWEL","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-elevates-developer-growth-with-engineering-ladders/","text":"How BizStream Elevates Developer Growth with Engineering Ladders\nWe have recently explored alternative methods to effectively evaluate and convey our developers\u2019 skill sets while also establishing a clear path for their future advancement.\nIf you\u2019ve been in the software development industry previously, you\u2019ve probably seen the typical \u201Ccompetency matrix\u201D for defining what a Junior, Mid-level, and Senior developer should look like at a given organization.\nFor example:\nSource\nWhile frameworks like these work, we had a handful of reasons for wanting to avoid this approach:\nAs you can see from the points above, we really wanted to find an approach that is much more granular than what is typically used, so that our developers can have a clearer growth path that\u2019s more individualized to their current skill set and experience. Enter Engineering Ladders\u2026\nWhen we came across the engineering ladders repository and started looking into its approach, we instantly felt it was a much better way of visualizing and quantifying developers\u2019 skills.\nTo give a quick overview, this framework uses radar charts to visually represent the different perspectives and expectations of a given position. These radar charts are made up of 5 axes that represent the main areas of interest when assessing developers. Those being:\nBase Engineering Ladder Template\nExample Engineering Ladder for an Individual\nWithin each axis are five different levels of performance, each including the previous ones. I won\u2019t list them here, but they can be viewed in the \u201CLevels\u201D section of the repository here.\nThe framework also has defined levels for developers, ranging from D1 through D7, which can be seen here. Some forks of this repository have even taken the liberty of mapping these levels to match some common \u201CBig Tech\u201D titles:\nWe saw this framework as an excellent starting point and decided the core concepts would be a great foundation for us at BizStream.\nEven though the engineering ladders approach was the route we wanted to take, there were a few key areas that we could address to make this framework fit BizStream even better, which are expanded upon below.\nWhen we first assessed the engineering ladders approach, we felt like it covered most aspects of what we look for in developers but needed just a few minor tweaks to be tailored to how BizStream runs and operates.\nBizStream\u2019s Engineer Ladder Template\nBizStream Junior\nBizStream Mid\nBizStream Senior\nWe decided to update the System axis to better match the type of work we do at BizStream, which mainly involved changing some of the verbiage of the levels to be more \u201Cproject\u201D focused and less \u201Csystem\u201D focused.\nFor the Process axis, we made a similar update to what we did with the System axis, in which we modified the verbiage to also encompass development standards. Although one could easily argue that development standards are a subset of processes, we felt it was beneficial to explicitly call them out so developers didn\u2019t just think about standard processes like code reviews and branching strategies.\nAs an agency, one of the main activities our developers\u2019 experience is interacting and interfacing with clients. Since this is such a large aspect of the developer role at BizStream, we felt it was necessary to create a new axis that allowed us to measure client involvement.\nAs we\u2019ll discuss in the data collection section below, we wanted to make sure we had some real-world examples of what it might look like for a developer to be at a given level in each axis, so we went through and added some \u201Ctrue to BizStream\u201D examples under each level within each axis. This was done to try and remove as much ambiguity as possible when reviewing the different levels in each axis.\nAs referenced above, the original framework has predefined developer levels (D1 through D7), depending on where a developer stands across all the different axes. Although we believe this to be better than the standard Junior, Mid-level, and Senior levels, we still didn\u2019t like the idea of having explicit titles for our developers. One of the main reasons for this decision is down to the variability that will exist for each individual developer. We feel it\u2019s much better to assess the area of a developer\u2019s chart to determine overall aptitude rather than trying to shoehorn them into predefined levels.\nOne of the main benefits of this framework, combined with the changes we made to fit our specific needs, enabled us to easily gather all the data we needed by conducting a self/peer review process. This process involved every developer at BizStream filling out a form that allowed them to review themselves and decide which level within each axis they felt they were currently at. They would then fill out this form for every other developer on their team so we would have their assessment of all the other developers on their team. We also added an extra data point for each developer by allowing their manager to provide their input in the same way since their manager would likely have some additional insights that their peers might not.We then took all these data points and used the median values from all responses for an individual to determine where they stand within a given axis. We found this worked better than taking an average since it would give us an explicit value rather than a decimal value that needed to be rounded up or down, which we found caused results to be skewed up or down depending on what rounding approach we took.In addition to using the median to determine the outcome for a given axis, we also looked at the standard deviation of the responses to look for any inconsistencies in the review process. This helped us to better understand where additional examples or clarifications needed to be implemented so we could ensure our data was as accurate as possible (which isn\u2019t the easiest when there\u2019s lots of subjectivity involved). The standard deviation also helped us find places where additional discussions needed to occur. If we found instances where not many people were in agreement with where someone\u2019s skills were, we would pull the necessary people together to get a better understanding of where they should be assessed to ensure that the data we have is as accurate as possible.\nOnce we had all the data we needed and verified that it was as accurate as possible, we had to find the best way to share this information with the developers at BizStream. To accomplish this, we decided to build individual reports for every developer that contained the following information:\nOnce all this information had been placed in a report, a meeting was scheduled to review the document with the developer. The finished report was also shared with the developer afterward for them to review and reference at any point in the future.\nThese reports are a great tool for developers and their managers to generate topics for discussion in one-on-ones and/or quarterlies. This gives developers and their managers the freedom to focus on whatever areas they believe matter the most.\nOverall, this new approach to assessing developers is a step in the right direction. While this was only the first year that we\u2019ve attempted this approach, it was well received by the team as a great way to quantify where they stand as a developer at BizStream. We also received some great feedback that we\u2019re excited to implement the next time we run through this process. One of the most significant improvements is an addition to the reports outlining what steps must be taken in each axis to jump to the next level. This gives developers a clear path of actionable steps that can be taken to expand their areas of expertise and make a larger impact at BizStream.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Words are the way we understand the world around us. They\u2019re the method we use to \u201Ctranslate\u201D and \u201Ctransmit\u201D our thoughts and feelings to others. However, that power goes both ways\u2014words can be used to influence our perception of the world (and others) by creating or reinforcing biases.\nInclusive language plays a pivotal role in fostering a diverse, equitable, and accessible environment. I\u2019ll explore the unique importance of inclusive language in the technology industry by highlighting its impact on representation, reviewing some common industry terms that could be improved, and ways language can improve accessibility design.\nBut first, I want to explain why this is important to BizStream.\nAt the very top of our About page, you\u2019ll see a single sentence: \u201CIt\u2019s always about the people, whether it\u2019s clients, employees and their families, or our communities.\u201D It\u2019s the first thing you see because it\u2019s the most important thing to us. We have an entire page dedicated to our community involvement, and we\u2019ve even been named an Inclusive Workplace by Best Companies Group and COLOR Magazine. We strive to make positive impacts within our organization, within our communities, and within the technology industry\u2014and at the center of it all is making sure that people feel empowered.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) drives innovation, creates a better work environment, improves customer understanding, and enhances decision-making. By embracing DEI, organizations can tap into a variety of perspectives, attract top talent, and develop products that meet the diverse needs of their customers. But it\u2019s more than just commercial success to us\u2014we believe that a fair and inclusive workplace aligns with our principles of treating everyone with dignity and respect.\nThe technology industry has long struggled to create inclusive and equitable environments. Statistics reveal that women, people of color, and individuals from other marginalized communities are often underrepresented in tech roles and leadership positions.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, African American individuals accounted for 7.9% of the computer and mathematical occupations workforce in the United States, despite representing 14.9% of the population. Hispanic/Latino individuals represented 8.4% in those same occupations, while making up 16% of the population.\nIn that same study, women represented only about 26.5% of the computer and mathematical occupations workforce.\nInclusive language is a crucial step toward dismantling these barriers. By using language that embraces diversity and promotes inclusivity, we create a more welcoming industry that encourages participation and bridges the representation gap.\nBy actively identifying and replacing non-inclusive language with more inclusive alternatives, we can foster an environment that promotes equality, respect, and inclusivity within the technology industry. It is essential to be mindful of the impact our language choices can have and continuously strive for improvement.\nInclusive language also has a direct line to designing for accessibility. Using clear, concise, and inclusive terminology ensures that digital interfaces and content are accessible to individuals with disabilities.\nLearn more about creating an inclusive web experience here.\nInclusive language is not just a buzzword; it requires an honest and dedicated approach to make a real impact. I\u2019ve had colleagues in the past roll their eyes at \u201Cpolitical correctness\u201D and bemoan any effort of inclusive language. But the thing to keep in mind is that it\u2019s not about checking a box, it\u2019s about being open to the thoughts and feelings of the people around you. It\u2019s about creating a dialogue of transparency, openness, and inclusion to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect.\nThe Impact of Inclusive Language on Tech\u2019s Diversity Gap\nThe Impact of Inclusive Language on Tech\u2019s Diversity Gap\nThe Impact of Inclusive Language on Tech\u2019s Diversity Gap\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

{"id":"289","pageTitle":"UTROABAITTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/understanding-the-role-of-a-business-analyst/","text":"Understanding the Role of a Business Analyst: Identifying the True Problem\nWhen I started as a business analyst at BizStream, I was advised that my primary responsibility was to identify the problems while the developers would focus on finding the solutions. Although I acknowledged the developer\u2019s crucial role in resolving issues, I found myself resisting this notion. After all, problem-solving was a skill I enjoyed and believed I excelled at. Wasn\u2019t this a primary reason I was hired in the first place? Despite myself, this line of thinking led me to contemplate the nature of problems and how we go about identifying them.\nIt became apparent that one cannot arrive at the correct solution without fully comprehending the problem at hand. Attempting to fix a car without diagnosing the issue or prescribing medication without understanding the ailment would likely exacerbate the problem rather than improve it. Similarly, when building projects at BizStream, it is imperative to grasp the client\u2019s challenges thoroughly to create effective solutions.\nAlbert Einstein once said, \u201CIf I had an hour to solve a problem, I would spend 55 minutes trying to understand the problem and 5 minutes solving it.\u201D This raises a fundamental question: How do we differentiate the true problem from mere symptoms or predetermined solutions?\nHere is a story I believe demonstrates this well:\nOne day, while walking through a forest, a young man came across a river. Thrashing about in the waves was a child, struggling to stay afloat. Immediately, the young man dove into the water and pulled the child to safety.\nAt first glance, the problem seems straightforward\u2014the child needs to be rescued, and the immediate solution is to jump in and save them.\nAs soon as the child was on shore, the young man looked up and, to his horror, saw two more children floating down river. Jumping back into the water, he grabbed one, then the other, pulling them ashore. A second later, another came struggling down the river. Without having the time to understand what was happening, the man continued rescuing the children as they floated down the river.\nThankfully, at that moment, a woman was walking by and saw all the chaos happening in the river. Grabbing a long stick, she jumped out onto a rock situated in the river, and extended it to those she could reach as they floated by.\nAt this point, someone else is confronted with the same problem but offers another solution. Oftentimes we find a solution to a problem and immediately quit looking for other potential solutions that may work even better.\nThe more the pair rescued, the more children that seemed to come down the river. The woman, reaching multiple children at a time as they floated within reach, and the man all the children that were farther out. Even still, they were quickly becoming tired and overwhelmed.\nAnother woman heard the commotion and came running. Seeing all the children in the water and the many more exhausted on the shore, she turned and began running upstream. The man and woman who were still actively trying to save children yelled to her, \u201CWhere are you going? We need help!\u201D As she was still running she yelled over her shoulder, \u201CTo find out who\u2019s throwing all these children in the water and stop them!\u201D\nIn this scenario, we uncover the underlying problem\u2014why are children being thrown into the river in the first place? Initially, rescuing the drowning children may appear to be the problem, but it is, in fact, a symptom of a more profound issue. While treating symptoms is essential in emergencies, consistently treating symptoms as the primary problem leads to trouble.For instance, if a client has a major bug that needs to be fixed that is caused by an aging technology stack, the best approach isn\u2019t to leave the bug while we figure out how to update the entire website. First, take care of the emergency, then take care of the underlying problem. However, we get into trouble when we continuously treat symptoms as If they were the underlying problem.\nThis takes us back to the original question: How do we know what the true problem is instead of a symptom of the problem? One question I like to ask that helps me identify the root issue is, \u201CHow would we ideally want such and such to function?\u201D\nAsking questions to the client that helps enlighten where we are headed is neither prompting a solution nor asking what the problem is. In fact, as said before, we cannot determine the solution before knowing the problem, and we cannot know the problem without knowing where we are trying to get to.\nTo take the above story as an example again, if you asked the first two who arrived on the scene what they would like to see happen or what is an ideal state considering the situation, having better recuse equipment or being a stronger swimmer would not really address the problem. It would address the immediate symptoms of the problem and may prove to be very helpful. However, they do not solve the problem. The answer is to not have children floating down the river.\nLet me take an example from building a website. Let\u2019s say a content admin has received frustrations from their website users that their homepage is too busy with links. The content admin comes to BizStream and requests we figure out a way for the homepage to be redesigned so that it looks less cluttered while still giving users the same amount of links to choose from so that users can still get to where they want to go.\nIn this situation, you may notice the client already has a solution in mind, that is, to redesign the homepage. But what is the problem? The users of the site feel that the homepage is too cluttered and the content admins feel the homepage needs all that information to support their many audiences.\nInstead of asking for the problem, let\u2019s ask the question, what do we ideally want to happen? In this case, I would argue that ideally, the user would land on the homepage and could immediately find what they are looking for without showing anything superfluous. This may seem at first impossible. After all, how can we know what the user wants to see on page load? But if we start with the end in mind, it can help us determine what the real problem is: Users aren\u2019t able to quickly and conveniently get to where they want to go. This problem statement opens up many more potential solutions than \u201CThe homepage is too cluttered\u201D.\nStating the problem more openly and based on an ideal ending, we can only now determine what a potential solution would look like. For example, we may suggest adding a more robust search with search ahead capabilities. Or, we might suggest personalization, an often underutilized feature of Kentico that tracks users\u2019 preferences and places them as part of a group set by the content admins. Content could then be displayed based on a user\u2019s history on the site. We could even simply allow users to set their own \u201Cfavorited\u201D links, allowing them to always quickly get to where they want and remove the rest.\nBy beginning with an ideal end in mind, it allows us to help uncover the root of the problem, rather than symptoms of a larger problem. And while symptoms do sometimes need to be dealt with, a holistic and effective solution can only be designed after the problem has correctly been identified. So even though solutioning is a technological challenge that often should be approached by the developers, it turns out that problem-finding needs quite a bit of solutioning itself.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

This adventure exemplified our commitment to \u201CWe Are a Team\u201D and \u201CBe Fearless,\u201D pushing ourselves beyond limits and finding strength in teamwork and encouragement as we hiked the two-mile sandy trail with all our gear.\nEvery couple of years, we hold our Company Picnic at Michigan\u2019s Adventure, a sprawling amusement and water park. This year, we indulged in a delicious fajita bar, bottomless drinks, and an unlimited ice cream bar with our families and then headed out to take on the rides.\nBeyond embodying our \u201CWork Hard, Play Hard\u201D core value, our company picnics exemplify our dedication to \u201CCare.\u201D These gatherings provide a platform for us to extend our commitment to families, offering them a chance to unwind and enjoy each other\u2019s company in a fun environment.\nAs the leaves change, we gear up for two more exciting events that continue to exemplify our culture and values. Geeky Little Holiday is laid back afternoon of festivities and celebration to kick off the winter holidays, complete with an ugly sweater contest. In December, we\u2019ll celebrate Christmas with our elegant holiday party. This year, at The Bissell Tree House, an enchanting indoor event venue perched atop one of Grand Rapids\u2019 highest points.\nCrafted with intention, our events team designs these occasions to offer our team a chance to unwind while nurturing our core values. Whether going the extra mile on the golf course, overcoming challenges in the wild, or enjoying moments with friends, family, and team members at the amusement park, our embrace of these experiences embodies our core values.\nAfter all, our founders built this company to push back on generic corporate culture, believing that life isn\u2019t just about the relentless grind. Instead, we find purpose in doing great work while working and finding time to unwind, foster genuine connections, and truly acquaint ourselves with one another.\nDiscover more about BizStream by exploring our About page or dive into opportunities on our Careers page.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

I developed a mantra to raise the bar for myself: \u201CAnticipate what everyone needs, and help them get it before they have to ask for it.\u201D I wanted to be proactive in my work, which required a change in my approach.\nEssentially I learned the brain is not to be trusted\u2026\nGood organization and time management skills are the unsung heroes of a good project manager. There was a time when I thought I could keep it all in my head, but after a few instances of forgetting to do or communicate important things, I started the barrage of Post-it notes around my workspace with lists of things I didn\u2019t have to remember. It wasn\u2019t long before I knew that was not the long-term solution.\nI\u2019m showing my age now, but it was shortly after I found the Franklin Covey method. Yeah, I had the planner and the custom pages that included the daily task list, and it CHANGED MY LIFE. I started prioritizing based on identifying and focusing on the most important tasks and activities. I was categorizing them based on their urgency and importance using tools like the Eisenhower Matrix, which divides tasks into four quadrants: important and urgent, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. By adopting this method, I gained clarity and focused on the most critical tasks while ensuring nothing important fell through the cracks.\nGenerally, it looks something like this:\nOnce I had my list, I would start converting and ordering based on overall priority:\nThen, I would assign a number to those items for higher priority to lower:\nThis mindset for setting priorities has stuck with me, even though my Franklin Planner has been replaced with many a digital app since then, but I will get to those in a second. While I highly recommend the above approach, you can do several other things to stay on top of your task list. Check out #5 in the below list for some of my recommendations.\nProductivity isn\u2019t just about being a taskmaster; it\u2019s about reclaiming control over your time and energy. Embrace the power of prioritization and make room for the things that truly matter, whether it\u2019s building relationships, personal growth, or taking care of yourself. Remember, it\u2019s not always about getting everything done; it\u2019s about getting the right things done. So, go forth with a renewed sense of purpose, armed with your chosen productivity tools, and carve out a path to success that reflects your unique journey.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

In this instance, however, I purposefully let it do just that (well, at least the taking my blog-writing job part). Using AI to generate content still requires getting through a bit of a learning curve in getting your prompts written well so that the tool knows exactly what you want. That being said, however, the below post was written entirely by the free version of ChatGPT. The only editing I did to this was to clean up a bit of formatting! Ok, well, that and a couple of notes where it was less than accurate.\nI will follow up in a future blog post with exactly the method I used to generate this content. For now, however, enjoy!\nPicture this: a marketing department where content writes itself, customer sentiment is instantly analyzed, and emerging trends are spotted effortlessly. It sounds like a marketing dream, right? Well, thanks to the power of AI, this dream is becoming a reality. In this blog post, we\u2019ll dive into how AI tools, such as ChatGPT, have transformed content creation, sentiment analysis, and trend spotting within marketing departments. Get ready to witness the magic unfold!\nWriting compelling blog posts, engaging social media content, and persuasive email campaigns can be a time-consuming task. But fear not, as AI tools have stepped in to lighten the load. ChatGPT, ConversionAI, and Writesonic are some of the powerhouses in content creation.\nChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, acts as a virtual writing assistant, helping marketers generate ideas, fine-tune their writing, and even create entire pieces effortlessly. It\u2019s like having a witty co-writer by your side, saving time and unleashing creativity.\nLearn more about ChatGPT\n(The link to ChatGPT it generated for itself, as you may have noticed, is a bad link. This is why AI still requires human supervision \uD83D\uDE42 you can use this link to actually Learn more about ChatGPT)\nConversionAI (formerly known as ContentBot) specializes in generating engaging and conversion-focused content. It leverages AI algorithms to create catchy headlines, compelling ad copies, and product descriptions that captivate audiences. With this tool in your arsenal, crafting captivating content becomes a breeze.\nExplore ConversionAI\n(You might notice the link to ConversionAI brings you to Jasper \u2013 another good example of proofreading your AI content just like you would from a human writer)\nWritesonic is another notable AI-powered tool that assists in content creation. It offers various writing templates, generates marketing copy, and even provides blog post ideas. This tool is a valuable resource for marketers looking to streamline their content creation process.\nVisit Writesonic\nUnderstanding your customers\u2019 sentiments and perceptions is vital in shaping your marketing strategies. Fortunately, AI has your back with sophisticated sentiment analysis tools. Let\u2019s explore a couple of renowned options.\nMonkeyLearn is a powerful AI platform that offers sentiment analysis capabilities. By analyzing customer feedback, reviews, and social media conversations, MonkeyLearn provides valuable insights into how your brand is perceived. It enables you to identify positive and negative sentiment, helping you make data-driven marketing decisions.\nDiscover MonkeyLearn\nLexalytics is another notable tool that excels in sentiment analysis. It provides advanced text analytics, helping you uncover sentiment, emotions, and opinions in customer feedback and online content. Lexalytics offers valuable insights that allow you to gauge brand perception and adjust your marketing strategies accordingly.\nVisit Lexalytics\nKeeping up with the ever-changing market trends is crucial for staying ahead of the competition. Thanks to AI-powered trend spotting tools, marketers can now ride the wave of success effortlessly.\nGoogle Trends is a widely-used tool that provides insights into the popularity and search volume of specific topics over time. It allows you to identify trending topics, compare interest between different terms, and uncover regional trends.

By embracing these tools and harnessing their capabilities, you\u2019ll unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation in your marketing strategies. So, let the AI magic guide you, and prepare to witness marketing like never before!\nReady to integrate AI into your marketing? Contact BizStream for more information on using AI tools or integrating AI into your website!\nOverall, letting any AI tool generate content without that supervision, curation, and editing is a dangerous practice. The technology has come a long, long way in a very short period of time, but it isn\u2019t completely independent. The tools themselves will warn you, but the accuracy of information is not guaranteed for everything from basic facts to the dots that it connects. In fact, I had to try several times to get resources that actually existed and weren\u2019t just made up by the bot.\nWhile learning how to write good prompts and churning out content en masse may make you a few bucks on Fiverr, it isn\u2019t a way to produce quality content and in no way replaces the need for human writers and editors. My experience has been that it is more of a starting point or an ideation tool.\nI use tools such as ChatGPT to give me ideas on other ways to word emails, suggest topics that I may not have thought of otherwise, or just get me past the initial writer\u2019s block I often get when writing blog posts. The common wisdom around BizStream is that AI can get you about 60% there, but it is up to you to take that and turn it into something quality and usable.\nShould you be using tools like ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, Midjourney, Jasper, etc, in your everyday workflow? Absolutely. You\u2019d have to pry GitHub Copilot out of the cold dead hands of most of our developers here. They are just that, though, tools. Maybe in another 10-15 years, we will be able to farm out a lot more total content creation to AI, but for now, at least, keep doing what you do best and let AI make you even better!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"298","pageTitle":"CAIWE7TFWA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/creating-an-inclusive-web-experience-7-tips-for-website-accessibility/","text":"Creating an Inclusive Web Experience: 7 Tips for Website Accessibility\nWeb accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites/content in a way that allows people with disabilities to access and use them effectively. This includes people with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The goal of accessibility is to ensure that all individuals can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites, similar to non-disabled users. This is achieved through designs and development techniques (including the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard navigation). Making websites accessible not only benefits people with disabilities but also benefits all users by creating a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.\nNot only is web accessibility good practice, but it\u2019s also a legal requirement in many countries. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in various areas of public life. Title III of the ADA requires places of public accommodation, including websites, to be accessible to people with disabilities.\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG, is a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provide a framework for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG is widely recognized as the global standard for web accessibility and is used as a reference by many countries and organizations in their web accessibility regulations and policies.\nFailure to comply with these legal standards and regulations could result in lawsuits, fines, or other legal actions. Website owners should ensure that their websites comply with the relevant accessibility standards and regulations in their country or region to avoid legal liabilities and promote equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities.\nWeb accessibility allows people of all abilities to have the same level of access to online services, information, and opportunities. In the long run, this can help improve quality of life and reduce isolation by allowing people with disabilities to participate in online activities such as socializing, shopping, and learning. Web accessibility also demonstrates social responsibility by promoting equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities. By designing websites that are accessible to people with disabilities, website owners can create a more inclusive and welcoming online environment that benefits everyone.\nWeb accessibility requires websites to have clear and consistent navigation structures that make it easy for users to find what they are looking for, which benefits all users. It also requires websites to provide text alternatives for images and videos, which benefits users who use screen readers or have visual impairments by allowing them to understand the content of a website. Web accessibility requires websites to be keyboard-accessible, meaning that users should be able to navigate and interact with a website using only a keyboard. Accessibility can also positively impact loading times by requiring efficient and optimized code, which directly impacts website performance. It also requires websites to have consistent designs and layouts, which makes it easier for users to understand and navigate the website.\nThere are several ways to make websites accessible. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\nAlt tags provide a text alternative to images on a website, making them accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers.\nHeadings help users navigate through a website, and they are especially important for people who use screen readers. Use descriptive headings that accurately convey the content of the page or section.\nVideos and audio content should have transcripts and captions to make them accessible to people with hearing impairments.\nUse clear and simple language on your website to make it easy to understand for people with cognitive impairments.\nPeople with motor impairments may not be able to use a mouse. Ensure that all functions on your website can be accessed using only the keyboard.\nEnsure that the color contrast on your website is high enough to make it accessible for people with visual impairments.\nFinally, test your website for accessibility using tools such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.\nIn conclusion, accessibility on websites is crucial for creating a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users. By following the tips above, website owners and developers can ensure that their website is accessible to people with a range of abilities, and in doing so, they are helping to create a more equitable and accessible online world.\nWant more?

{"id":"301","pageTitle":"CACFCFAPBWIK1","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/creating-a-custom-form-component-for-a-page-builder-widget-in-kentico-13/","text":"Creating a Custom Form Component for a Page Builder Widget in Kentico 13\nIn this post, we will explore creating custom form components for Page Builder widgets. We will create an Icon Selector form control allowing content administrators to pull icons from a selected font.\nThis solution is based on a Kentico 13 Xperience website using MVC and ASP.NET Core.\nBuilding Page Builder widgets is about creating reusable components for content administrators to create beautiful pages. Once you have your requirements for the widget, you can begin writing the solution. In our case, we need to create a button that will support the following items:\nWith the above requirements, something jumps out with two of them \u2013 styles for the button as well as the inclusion of an icon. In order to tackle that problem, we need a form control for the widget so content administrators can choose which icon they want to use.\nThe desired outcome will be a text box with a button. When the textbox receives focus or the button is clicked, a container that looks similar to a drop-down will appear with the icons showing. Clicking an icon will select one, filling in the textbox with the CSS class of the icon.\nTo create the Page Builder Form Component, we will need to make the following files:\nWe will be placing these files in our Web project since Page Builder is driven by the website\u2019s frontend.\nIn the Web project, we will start with the class file. I created the following file:\nWeb/{yourViewPath}/IconSelector/IconSelectorFormComponent.cs\nThe first thing to be done is to register the component. Add the following line above the namespace:\nNext, you will want the IconSelectorFormComponent to inherit from the TextInputComponent, allowing us to extend the built-in Kentico component.\nThen, you will create a new public constant to support the component registration we did above.\nSo far, your class file should look something like this:\nWe still need to create a few things to tie the classes together for the icon font. To do that, we need to download the font we want to use and create a class with the CSS font classes as string values.\nOnce you have an icon font, you can assemble the class file.\nWeb/Models/Configuration/IconFont.cs\nThe class variables are strings named to match the keys of our key-value pairs in the JSON file to deserialize properly. A snippet of the class:\nLet\u2019s jump back over to IconSelectorFormComponent.cs and finish off the class. We will declare a new method called GetIconClasses(). This method will read the class through Reflection and use LINQ to return an IEnumerable\u003Cstring\u003E of our CSS classes.\nAt this point, we are ready to create the view for the form component. In the Web project, I created the following file:\nWeb/{yourViewPath}/IconSelector/_IconSelectorFormComponent.cshtml\nFirst, we will want to do a couple of imports as well as identify the model:\nOne thing to keep in mind when developing form controls for Page Builder is that there are likely to be multiple widgets on a page at the same time. To make this work correctly, we will use Razor to create a unique identifier for each control on the page. We also need to give our input a class to support the JavaScript we will write to handle our events. To do that, we first have to remove the class attribute since the property is read-only, but we must also maintain the original classes.\nNext up is the presentation, where we will declare an input, a button for the input, and a drop-down of buttons for selecting the icon visually. The drop-down will be hidden by default, and we will show and hide it with events in the JavaScript we will write after the presentation markup.\nWe need to include the JavaScript in the markup file because we need to use the GUID that we created so we get the correct elements when there are multiple instances on the same page.\nWe will add click events for the buttons and a focus and blur event for a better user experience.\nFinally, we can wrap things up by styling the form component. We want the input to match the rest of the form and the drop-down to look nice and hover absolutely positioned underneath the input.\nYou can get creative with your classes or be a bit heavy-handed with some important declarations on some styles. For the sake of this tutorial, I went the heavy-handed route, as the main focus is the functionality above, and these styles will only be used for this particular use case.\nNote \u2013 we aren\u2019t covering this topic in this tutorial, but I am using Tailwind CSS for styling to keep things simple.\nIn conclusion, the custom form component created in this tutorial offers a wealth of benefits for content editors working with Kentico 13. Developing the ability to add custom icons and easily reuse the component in future widgets, creates a powerful tool for enhancing the flexibility and functionality of page builder widgets. With this component, content editors can work more efficiently and with greater ease, resulting in an improved overall user experience for website visitors. Extending Kentico in this way, demonstrates the platform\u2019s robust capabilities for customization and adaptation to specific business needs.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

So then, what is a headless CMS, and how can it benefit your next project or evolve your current one?\nIn this article, we will explore the benefits of using a headless CMS (Content Management System) such as Storyblok and why it\u2019s a better solution than the traditional CMS.\nA headless CMS separates the content from the presentation layer; this architecture is known as composable architecture. In the architecture of a traditional CMS, content, and presentation are tightly integrated. This means that making changes to the presentation layer often requires changes to the underlying content structure. By keeping these two separate using a headless CMS such as Storyblok, it allows for greater flexibility and scalability since changes to one layer do not affect the other.\nA headless CMS provides content creators with a user-friendly interface to allow them to manage their content within. Developers can then make use of APIs to gather the content and display it on any device. With this, your app or website can have the desired look and feel you want it to have without having to affect the content that\u2019s present.\nWhile a traditional CMS platform can be user-friendly, they often lack in performance, customization, and the flexibility and scalability that was mentioned earlier for which a headless CMS can provide. Let\u2019s talk about how a headless CMS can improve your project in those three areas that a traditional CMS struggles to keep up in.\nWith the understanding of what a headless CMS is and how it compares to a traditional CMS, let\u2019s now take a look at the powerful headless CMS that I keep referring to called Storyblok, and why it could be a great option for you to consider for your next project!\nAs you can see, a headless CMS can provide numerous benefits for your next project. By separating the content from the presentation layer, it allows for improved performance, customization, personalization, and greater flexibility along with scalability. The headless CMS Storyblok offers a platform that is developer-friendly, user-friendly, and has a powerful visual editor making it easy to manage your website or app\u2019s content. It can also allow your business to create a more efficient and personalized experience for your audience across multiple channels, making it a great option for any project.\nLooking to take your brand from ideation to launch?

{"id":"305","pageTitle":"AIJJS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/ai-in-juvenile-justice-software/","text":"AI in Juvenile Justice Software\nLast week, I attended an event by West Michigan Tech Talent, \u201CTech Trends with Keith Brophy.\u201D Keith is a futurist, Michigan Entrepreneur of the Year winner, and a long-time speaker on areas of digital transformation, including AI, Machine Learning, the Internet of Things, and Cyber Security.\nAs you can imagine, Keith\u2019s tech trends this year were focused on Artificial Technology (AI) and how it will change the world. This wasn\u2019t a big surprise, as AI, ChatGPT, Bard, and other technology have been filling headlines and social media feeds. What was a big surprise to me was his prediction that AI would change law enforcement.\nKeith\u2019s take was that Police and AI would come together, providing guidance to officers in the field to help de-escalate situations. Body cameras utilizing AI technology to read facial expressions and body language with audio feeding in the ear of the officer providing prompts to guide the officer to a better outcome. This was a novel use of AI I hadn\u2019t heard of before \u2013 using tech already in use combined with AI to assist in situations where an officer may not have experience or a mental health professional can\u2019t be on site. That use was very interesting and got me thinking of how we could use AI in our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software.\nAI has been tried in the court system and has had its share of problems. Bias has been a historical issue with AI\u2019s use in the justice system. In 2016, ProPublica highlighted this issue in an article titled \u201CMachine Bias,\u201D which scrutinized predictive policing software (AI) and revealed its racial bias against black individuals. ProPublica isn\u2019t alone in publishing information about AI use in the justice system; both The Atlantic and the UCLA Law Review published articles in 2019 highlighting the risks of perpetuating systemic biases, lack of transparency, and potential for erroneous decision-making when relying on AI algorithms.\nWe have explored using AI to predict recidivism or the success of a juvenile based on data stored in our system but have yet to put it to use based on the potential pitfalls outlined in the articles mentioned above. If prediction isn\u2019t a fair use of the technology, how else could we use AI to better the experience of our users and help benefit the youth they are working with?\nThe truth is some of our YouthCenter users are using AI without even realizing they\u2019re using AI, with voice-to-text. With voice-to-text, they\u2019re dictating their case notes rather than typing them in. It\u2019s such a popular feature that I\u2019ve gotten hugs at conferences from caseworkers that utilize voice-to-text to enter their case notes. These case managers or probation officers (POs) are ecstatic because they\u2019re not bogged down by the administrative duties of case management, and it allows them the ability to spend additional time with the youth to coach them to better outcomes.\nVoice-to-text is a great way to use AI to benefit the user without introducing bias. We\u2019re not alone in this technology use. Medical startups like Ambience and DeepScribe are transforming the way Doctors, nurses, and other practitioners interact with patients. No more typing data into an EMR; the technology listens, transcribes, and pulls important data from the conversation into electronic medical records (EMR).\nOne of the unique features of YouthCenter is the Client Activity Log. The Activity Log is like a Facebook or Twitter timeline of any interaction or event with the youth. Events and entries are listed in chronological order, grouped by date, and ordered by time. The Activity log can be filtered by event or searched. While the Activity log provides a detailed listing of everything, it can be challenging to get a big-picture overview of what\u2019s happening with the youth at a glance.\nLarge language models, like GPT-3.5 (also known as ChatGPT), are excellent at summarizing complex information. AI-powered systems have the ability to quickly analyze and comprehend vast amounts of data. Data could include case notes, drug tests, program progress, and assessment scores. By processing this information, AI can generate concise and easy-to-understand summaries tailored to the needs of users, in our case, case workers, administrators, or POs. This not only saves time and resources for those involved in the justice system but also helps ensure that critical details are effectively communicated to all relevant parties. The use of AI in this context paves the way for more efficient and informed decision-making, ultimately improving the outcomes for young individuals in the juvenile justice system.\nI listen to Spotify\u2019s \u201CDaily Drive\u201D on the way to the office almost every day. It\u2019s a short, customized summary of the day\u2019s news combined with the music I listen to. It\u2019s a great way to start the day. What if I could get a summary of my day sent to me? Imagine if you were a supervisor and could get a short summary of all the clients in your jurisdiction and listen to it on the way to the office. You\u2019re up to speed before you even walk in the door. Combining the AI summary capabilities with text-to-voice could make this possible.\nWhat could make this even more interesting is using technology like Spotify has done with their AI DJ and voice-mimicking technology like Microsoft\u2019s VALL-E to build out a custom YouthCenter secure audio stream. Summaries could then be read in the voice and tone of the primary caseworker working with the specific youth. If you\u2019re a supervisor, you can get an update on the cases your team is working on in the voice of the case manager working with the youth case.\nAll these new use cases for AI in Juvenile Justice are great, but there are a few things we need to think about, and that\u2019s data security and privacy. Nobody should be copying and pasting any juvenile data into ChatGPT to get summaries. Lucky for us, we have our very own Microsoft Azure MVP on staff here who keeps us up to speed on this technology and issues like privacy.\nOur YouthCenter Juvenile Case Management Software is hosted in the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud, which adds additional layers of security for our clients and us. The Azure OpenAI service is also available in the Government Cloud, allowing for the separation of juvenile data from other data sources through enterprise-grade security, role-based access control (RBAC), and private networks. Keeping juvenile data secure and away from others who shouldn\u2019t have access to it is a high priority. We take that security very seriously and will examine any AI technology and its access and sharing before we implement it.\nWe\u2019re happy to be a partner with Microsoft in AI technology. They\u2019ve developed a Responsible AI Standard that addresses many of the concerns with previous implementations of AI through their six principles for responsible AI: accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. Those 6 principles guide the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, and tests AI systems. Their commitment to inclusiveness, transparency, privacy, and security makes them an ideal partner for us in building AI technology into our juvenile case management system.\nThe potential for AI to transform the juvenile justice system is huge. There are ways to harness the power of AI responsibly. Focusing on applications like voice-to-text, summarization, and personalized updates, we can improve efficiency, communication, and overall outcomes for young individuals without perpetuating biases. As we implement the technology, we need to be aware of and address data security and privacy concerns.\nAs we continue to innovate and refine our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software, we are excited about the opportunities that AI presents to support caseworkers, probation officers, and, most importantly, the youth they serve. By responsibly integrating AI, we can help to revolutionize the juvenile justice system and create a brighter future for all.\nIf you\u2019re a YouthCenter client of ours and want early access to the AI capabilities we\u2019re adding, register here.\nAI technologies were used to create this article. Tools including Grammarly and ChatGPT were used to shape the article, modify the text, and in some cases, generate text in the article.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"306","pageTitle":"5BOATIWD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/5-benefits-of-automated-testing-in-web-development/","text":"5 Benefits of Automated Testing in Web Development\nWorking in website development is an exciting and fast-paced career. We are consistently developing and updating many different sites at any given time. As features are added, and changes are made, it\u2019s essential to keep quality in mind at every stage of the development process. What is the best way to ensure top-notch quality on a website? Manual testing is a great place to start, but it can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when there are too many changes and updates to keep track of. That is where automated testing comes in; my favorite method of testing to date.\nAutomated testing is the process of using software tools to run predefined tests on a website or web application. These tests can check the functionality, performance, security, and usability of a site in a faster and more efficient way. Automated tests are typically run on a regular basis, allowing developers and testers to quickly identify any issues and fix them before they become major problems.\nAlthough there are many different reasons to implement automated testing into your development process, there are a few main benefits that outweigh the rest. As a quality assurance specialist, automation is a huge help in my day-to-day workflow. Here are the top five benefits of automated testing:\nAutomated testing significantly reduces the time required to test a website. In traditional manual testing, every feature and function of the website must be tested manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. With automated testing, test cases are written once and can be executed repeatedly without any manual intervention. This speeds up the testing process and allows QA specialists to focus on more critical tasks. Additionally, automated test scripts execute extremely fast, meaning that a large number of tests can be run after deployments or nightly.\nManual testing can lack accuracy due to human factors such as fatigue, distraction, and personal biases. Automated testing eliminates these factors and ensures that every test case is executed in the same way every time. This consistency improves the accuracy of testing and ensures that defects are identified and resolved before the website is deployed to production. Additionally, automated testing allows QA specialists to test a large number of scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to test manually.\nAutomated testing can significantly reduce the overall cost of testing for website development. While there is an initial investment required for setting up the testing infrastructure and writing test cases, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. Automated testing reduces the need for manual testing, which is time-consuming and expensive. It also reduces the risk of regression issues arising in production, which can be costly to fix. The earlier an issue is caught in the development process, the cheaper it is to fix it, which is why automated testing should be implemented as early as possible.\nAutomated testing allows the QA team to test a wider range of scenarios and use cases than would be possible with manual testing. This increased test coverage ensures that defects and issues are identified and resolved before the website is in the clients\u2019 hands. Additionally, automated testing can simulate real-world scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to replicate manually. This ensures that the website is tested thoroughly and that it meets the needs of end-users.\nAutomated testing provides valuable insights into the performance and behavior of a website during testing. Unlike manual testing, where feedback is often limited to human observation and documentation, automated testing generates detailed reports that include metrics such as response times and error rates. These reports can help quality assurance specialists identify issues and analyze data to optimize testing strategies.Automated testing also offers real-time feedback, allowing for rapid iteration and improvement during website development. With this enhanced feedback, teams can quickly identify and resolve issues, leading to a more efficient and effective development process. Additionally, this feedback can help teams to identify trends and patterns that might be difficult to spot with manual testing and can lead to further improvements in the quality and reliability of a website.\nIn conclusion, automated testing is a powerful tool that can help development teams ensure that their websites are high-quality and relatively error-free. Although it\u2019s nearly impossible to release bug-free code, automated tests can still provide a lot of peace of mind that the main functionality is working as expected. If you are not already using automated testing in your development process, I highly recommend setting it up on a small scale to see if it\u2019s right for your organization. It will take some time to learn and implement, but the benefits are substantial.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"308","pageTitle":"BEWACW","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/bizstreams-experience-with-a-compressed-workweek/","text":"BizStream\u2019s Experience With a Compressed Workweek\nThe four-day workweek, also known as the \u201Ccompressed workweek,\u201D has been gaining popularity as a way to improve employee productivity and well-being while also benefiting the environment. Over the summer of 2022, BizStream decided to give the shortened workweek a try for 13 weeks. We did this by shortening our weekly meetings and reducing our utilization goals. Like everything, there are tradeoffs, but overall, it was a beneficial experiment that we\u2019ll likely be trying again. After switching back to 40-hour workweeks, we held a company-wide discussion and poll about what worked, what didn\u2019t, what our goals are for next time, and the benefits.\nThe post-experiment survey results showed overwhelming support, with 100% of the participants saying they would like to try it again. Some of the benefits specifically mentioned were reduced stress and burnout, which was largely attributed to the long weekend or shorter days, depending on how the 32 hours were split throughout the week. As a result, participants mentioned feeling more refreshed and productive while at work.\nThe extra day also allowed teams to schedule team bonding activities. Go-Karts, axe throwing, and a trip to Dave and Busters are just a few examples of the activities that teams enjoyed together.\nPersonally, I found the compressed workweek extremely beneficial. I was able to schedule appointments, run errands, take more time to be with my kids, and volunteer. Having that extra time to focus on my family and myself was amazing.\nDespite the overwhelming support for the shorter workweek, there were some issues mentioned. These include elevated stress levels in client-facing employees and team managers, less time for teams to communicate, and any issues with professionalism were amplified in the compressed workweek. For example, showing up late in a shorter week has a much bigger impact on the team since they have less time together. The same is true for any issues with communication. For example, if team members are not clearly communicating with each other, then any problems that arise from that will be felt more acutely in a shorter time frame.\nThe post-experiment survey clearly identified some improvements we could make to ensure future 4-day workweeks go more smoothly. Here\u2019s what we learned:\nFirst attempts sometimes go poorly. No matter how much thought and planning go into something, there are almost always unforeseen issues. What matters is how you react to them and what you learn. BizSteam clearly learned a lot from this experience and is dedicated to making future attempts work better.\nWith 100% of the survey participants saying they would like to do it again, there have been a couple of ideas put forward to make that happen. One of the ideas is to work a 36-hour workweek instead of 32. This would still allow for shorter days while also keeping BizStream open on Fridays. Overall, BizStream has shown that the four day workweek, while tricky at times, is completely doable. In addition, the increased time away from the office allows our team members to slow down and spend time with their families or get out and enjoy our short (but sweet) Michigan summers.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Namely, support for OAuth 2.0 was added. On the surface, this change appears to be beneficial; however, this introduces a breaking change. In environments that use unsecure SMTP servers, emails were failing. They were being routed through the new MailKit implementation. By default, MailKit will require the connection made to the SMTP server to use TLS/SSL.\nCurrently, Kentico version 12.0.102 has been released and provides ISmtpClientFactory. This interface allows us to create a MailKit client. If you have a more advanced use case, the following solution will likely not be beneficial for you. Instead, you can upgrade to version 12.0.102 and create the fix that fits your needs.\nAs a quick fix, what we\u2019ve done is override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client from the System.Net.Mail namespace. The methods SendEmailInternal and SendEmailAsyncInternal are where we override the logic. Since the internal email provider has limited accessibility levels, we needed to copy various methods from the original provider into our custom provider.\nIn conclusion, the introduction of support for OAuth 2.0 in Kentico version 12.0.101 was a welcome change, but it also brought about an unintended consequence for environments that use unsecure SMTP servers. This led to email failures when routing through the new MailKit implementation, which required TLS/SSL connections to the SMTP server. A quick fix for the issue is to override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client, which requires copying various methods into a custom provider due to limited accessibility levels. Overall, this experience highlights the importance of careful consideration and testing of changes to underlying implementations in software updates.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Your brand is not just your logo or your website; it\u2019s the entire experience that your customers have with your company. To ensure that your brand experience is consistent, relevant, and engaging, there are five key questions that you should ask yourself.\nA brand guide and a style guide can be invaluable tools in building a comprehensive and consistent brand identity for your company.\nA brand guide outlines the fundamental elements of your brand, such as its vision, values, and messaging. It provides guidance on how your brand should be presented across all channels, ensuring that your branding is consistent and aligned with your company\u2019s mission and goals. A well-crafted brand guide can help you maintain brand consistency, build brand recognition, and establish a unique identity in the market.\nA style guide, on the other hand, focuses on the visual aspects of your brand, including the use of colors, typography, imagery, and other design elements. It provides clear guidelines on how to use these elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing brand image. A style guide can help your team understand how to use your brand\u2019s visual elements consistently, reducing the risk of confusion or misrepresentation.\nAlthough brand guides and style guides can exist on their own, they\u2019re even more effective when combined together. Incorporating style guide sections within the overall brand guide creates a more robust, single source of assets and guidelines. Having well-documented brand and style guidelines creates a strong and consistent brand identity that resonates with your audience and helps you stand out from your competitors. By providing clear guidance on how to represent your brand, these combined guides save time and resources by streamlining the branding process and ensuring that all team members are aligned.\nDiscover how BizStream collaborated closely with the Woodpreneur team to establish a cohesive brand identity across various channels such as their brand, website, podcast, merchandise, and beyond.\nIt\u2019s not necessary to update your brand colors every year to keep up with the latest design trends, but incorporating a modern color palette can certainly have its advantages. Using contemporary color schemes can help your brand appear fresh, relevant, and appealing to a younger audience.In addition to colors, having a modern logo design can also make a significant impact on your brand image. A well-designed logo with a contemporary look can signal to your audience that your brand is up-to-date and keeping pace with the latest design trends. This can help you to stand out from your competitors and attract new customers.However, it\u2019s important to strike a balance between modernity and timelessness. A brand\u2019s visual identity should be distinctive and recognizable, not simply a reflection of current trends.

This will help your audience recognize and remember your brand easily, and it will also reinforce your company\u2019s vision and values.\nCreating a consistent brand experience is crucial for building strong customer relationships. Imagine having a great customer experience with a company during the initial stages of a sale, only to discover that the final invoice letterhead displays a logo from 10 years ago or the website\u2019s color scheme is completely different from the rest of the company\u2019s branding. Such inconsistencies can create confusion and erode trust in the brand, potentially leading to lost customers.\nTo avoid such situations, it\u2019s important to pay attention to every detail of your brand\u2019s representation across all platforms, both digital and non-digital. Whether it\u2019s your website, social media profiles, or printed materials, ensure that your branding is consistent and reflects your company\u2019s vision and values.

{"id":"314","pageTitle":"MYKSUWFR","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/maximizing-your-kentico-sites-ux-with-fallback-redirects/","text":"Maximizing Your Kentico Site\u2019s UX With Fallback Redirects\nIn the fast-paced world of website management, changes are inevitable. Pages may move or be removed, and links can become outdated, leading to frustrating 404 errors for visitors and negatively impacting search engine rankings. That\u2019s where fallback redirects come in. By using these redirects, you can ensure that visitors are always directed to the correct pages, even if the original URL is no longer valid. This creates a more ideal user experience, helps maintain search engine rankings, and keeps your Kentico website running smoothly. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the benefits of custom fallback redirects and provide best practices for implementing them on your website.\nHaving a fallback redirect can be a lifesaver for websites with frequently changing or moving content. Imagine a well-maintained structure that guides visitors to their desired destination, with a news landing page to help them navigate to individual news nodes. But what happens when a news article is archived, and the page can\u2019t be found? It would be helpful to have a fallback redirect. With this tool, you can ensure a flawless user experience by routing visitors back to the news landing page, even when content disappears. Using a fallback redirect will provide a better user experience that will keep visitors coming back for more.\nIf you\u2019re managing a website with blogs that use a structure like site/blogs/(document-name), a site restructuring or migration can pose a challenge. For example, without a landing page for blogs on the new site, visitors may encounter 404 errors when trying to access a blog that has been moved or removed. By implementing a fallback routing for blogs, you can ensure that visitors will be seamlessly routed to the news landing page when they try to access a blog affected by the restructuring.\nIn addition to scenarios where content is frequently changing or moving, there are also cases where content needs to be removed from a website because it is time-sensitive, such as events that have passed or promotions that have ended. Automatic archiving can be a useful tool in this situation, as it can move content no longer relevant to a separate archive rather than deleting it altogether. However, even with automatic archiving in place, visitors may still try to access this content after it has been moved, resulting in 404 errors. Search engines may also be led astray by URLs that have been moved or deleted. By using a fallback redirect, you can ensure that visitors are routed to an appropriate page, such as an archived events page or a promotions archive, when they try to access content that has been removed due to time sensitivity. This will also preserve a consistent user experience and search engine rankings, even during a website cleanup.\nRedirects play a critical role in website maintenance, ensuring a seamless user experience when content changes or moves. But how do you create these redirects, and where should they be stored? To maintain a clean and organized project, redirects should be added to a new class in a location for extensions. This allows for easy management and ensures a consistent naming convention. Then, when a 404 error occurs, the URL is checked against these rules to determine if a redirect should be triggered. It\u2019s like having a virtual gatekeeper for your website, ensuring that visitors always find the right content. Proper implementation of redirects can help prevent frustration for visitors and ensure that your website remains user-friendly. Following best practices for creating and checking redirects, you can become an expert in website maintenance and optimization. Below is an example of a redirect extension to ensure that child pages are redirected to the landing page in the case of a 404 error.\nTo use the custom redirect rules, they must be added to the Configure method in Startup.cs (or the app section, depending on the version of .NET). This is done by calling the appropriate method within the IApplicationBuilder, such as app.UseCustomLandingRedirects(). Including the code below in your startup configuration ensures that your website directs visitors to the right content, even when pages are moved or deleted. This helps to maintain a positive user experience on your website.\nOnce the custom redirect rules have been implemented, site visitors and search engines will always be redirected to the correct pages, even if the original URL is no longer valid. It\u2019s also possible to create new custom redirect classes and add them to the startup configuration to fall back to multiple URLs. In addition, by changing the page type retrieved, you can specify which page visitors should be directed to in the case of a 404 error. This allows for greater flexibility and control over your website\u2019s content and navigation.\nOne of the great things about custom redirects is their flexibility. You can create as many fallback redirects as needed to ensure visitors always find what they\u2019re looking for. Whether you\u2019re handling news articles, blog posts, event pages, or other types of content, custom redirects ensure that visitors are always directed to the appropriate landing page. By taking a comprehensive approach to custom redirects and customizing them to meet your specific needs, you can create a highly effective website maintenance strategy that keeps your visitors engaged and satisfied. Additionally, by following the best practices outlined in this article and staying on top of changes to your website\u2019s structure and content, you can ensure that your custom redirects continue to provide value and enhance the user experience over time.\nBy taking advantage of custom redirects, website owners and developers can ensure that visitors always find the content they\u2019re looking for, even if a page has been moved, deleted, or archived. Creating custom redirects may require some effort upfront, but the benefits of user satisfaction and search engine optimization can be significant. In addition, by following the best practices outlined in this article, such as identifying the need for redirects, creating and checking redirect rules, and adding them to the startup configuration, you can become an expert in website maintenance and optimization. Ultimately, custom redirects are a powerful tool that can help you keep your website running smoothly and keep visitors engaged and satisfied.\nWhether your team is looking to upgrade an existing site, tackle a complex integration, or start from scratch, our team of 35\u002B highly-skilled developers, designers, and digital strategists, including a\u00A0Kentico MVP, has the expertise to take your brand from strategy to launch.

That information lives inside a brain trust that, if left untapped, runs the risk of leaving vital knowledge out that could be crucial in informing the direction of your project. A good discovery team helps ensure that the work you\u2019ve done in gathering requirements is honored and shared so a plan can be assembled (see what I did there?).\nBut what if we don\u2019t know all the requirements yet, you might ask.

Ensuring that your technical team has a good understanding of their requirements or must-haves is essential to achieving your project\u2019s objectives.\nIn many instances, organizations have teams dedicated to these areas of focus, and ensuring you have those people as part of your discovery team can ensure that nothing gets missed or forgotten.\nThis one might seem like a gimme, but I assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. Getting the right people on board ensures that decisions are made that continue to drive the project toward a successful implementation phase. Suppose those people cannot be made available, however, and have schedules that do not permit them to participate in the discovery process. In that case, the information you\u2019ve curated and the technical requirements you\u2019ve assembled will remain unrevealed.Discovery is a commitment. It takes time, consistency, and diligence to ensure that all your project needs get unearthed. Work with your project manager to build out a discovery roadmap that both teams can adhere to, and do your best to ensure that all participants understand the importance of their preparation and participation.\nThese tips ultimately stack or compound; having the right people in the room ensures we iron out the must-haves of a project and narrow in on the technical specifications to come up with a plan for our clients that is tailored to their needs. Adequate scheduling helps us as an agency navigate the sometimes difficult terrain of discovery and drive to answers and solutions more quickly.We have found these tips to be most beneficial as we\u2019ve worked with hundreds of clients through the discovery process, and we hope this aids you in your discovery journey as well.

{"id":"319","pageTitle":"ACFATKSSSSAE","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/a-code-first-approach-to-kentico-smart-search/","text":"A Code First Approach to Kentico Smart Search Settings: Stopping Ambiguous Errors\nKentico Xperience provides an integration with Azure Cognitive Search that allows you to store website content and data within the Azure Search Indexes. After configured, data is populated and kept up to date when changes are made. This allows developers to fully utilize the power of Azure to implement solutions on websites.\nWhen configuring the search indexes, you must set the search settings for every field on every page type. If you have a large site with many page types, this can be a daunting task. It becomes even more problematic when multiple page types contain the same field names. Every search setting must be correct, or either the indexing will fail, or the queries will fail. There is no way to know if you have your settings correct unless you try and rebuild the indexes or, after waiting for the indexes to build and submit a query. Troubleshooting this can be very time-consuming and is exacerbated when you have many page types.\nTo solve this problem, I\u2019ve chosen a code-first approach using attributes to decorate the fields we want indexed and reflection to get the settings out of the code. For simplicity, we\u2019ll set the settings using a single-run scheduled task. You just need to remember to run this if the page type fields change.\nCreating a custom attribute in C# is pretty straightforward. It is just another class, but it inherits the Attribute. With the attribute we create, we also need to include a DisplayName attribute. Our property name will be different from the names that Kentico uses in the settings, so the attribute is there to match the names Kentico expects.\nEach property corresponds to a check box on the search settings tab within the page type. Also included are properties for local page indexes.\nBy using an interface, we can specify which page types should have search enabled. This allows us to turn indexing on and off within code and not on the search configurations screens. Because we are using reflection to gather all the search classes by implementing a Search interface, we can easily identify the page types.\nIt is a very simple interface containing just the Class Name, which many of the page types might already have.\nThe first thing that needs to be done when creating our service is creating our interface.\nThis step isn\u2019t 100% necessary since we are not using dependency injection with our scheduled task, but I\u2019ve added it for code consistency. We cannot create a search index service class and implement the interface.\nSometimes, with reflection, there are assemblies that are referenced that are not loaded. If we try to get the types of that referenced assembly, an exception will be thrown. We need to handle this particular exception properly. We are not interested in those referenced 3rd party assemblies, so we want to ignore them.\nAs mentioned above, the simplest way to execute this code from the Admin UI is to create a scheduled task. It is a simple scheduled task that creates an instance of the service we created and executes it against a list of page type DataClassInfos.\nTo actually use the attributes, a new class needs to be created that corresponds with the page types. You could probably use Kentico\u2019s page type code generator and decorate those attributes. Still, any time you re-generate the code, you need to remember that you have attributes in your generated code. The way I have found that works best is to create POCOs (plain Old C# Object) based on the page types. The downside here is making sure you keep them updated when you add/remove fields on the page types.\nWe can create a Base class with all the common properties that our entity classes inherit. Make sure you do not add attributes to built-in Page Type properties such as NodeID and NodeAliasPath.\nWith our base class created we can create our entity POCO\nAny properties that are not decorated will have all the checkboxes unchecked.\nWith our attributes added, we can now build our admin project and add our scheduled task.\nSetting up and maintaining search indexes can be a very frustrating task, especially when you are dealing with many page types with the same fields that all need to be included in your indexes. Using a code-first approach is just one way to make this process a little easier. Attributes are a way to keep your settings contained in version control, but there are a few caveats. Since the settings are now in version control, any changes you want to make to your indexes must be done with code. You must also keep your POCOs up to date when adding any fields you want to be included in your indexes. I find this inconvenience makes up for the time-consuming complexities when manually managing your search settings.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"322","pageTitle":"WDOTJTP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/why-developers-owe-their-jobs-to-philosophers/","text":"Why Developers Owe Their Jobs to Philosophers\nPhilosophy often gets a bad rap for being a pointless and futile endeavor. What does a degree in studying metaphysics, epistemology, or logic get you other than a job at Pizza Hut? As interesting as questions like, \u201CDoes God exist?\u201D can be, shouldn\u2019t they be relegated between the hours of one and four in the morning over drinks with friends?\nTo these critiques, I like to remind people that not only can most of your assumptions and beliefs about the world be traced back to philosophers, there are a lot of pretty cool technologies out there that once only existed in the abstract writings of philosophers until the technology was able to catch up and make practical use from them. Even universities, where so much innovation has been born, originated with Plato in 387 BC when he created the first university called The Academy (which is why education is called academics).\nSimilarly, there is a lot of terminology in Computer Science that can be traced back to the philosophers who are credited with laying its foundation. If you\u2019ve ever worked with developers, you\u2019ll often hear them use terminologies such as backend logic, languages, objects, arrays, strings, boolean operators, and arguments. Here are some notable philosophers who developed these ideas and why developers owe their jobs to them.\nLet\u2019s start with George Boole (1815\u20131864). Developers who are a bit more attentive may already have an idea of his contributions based on his name. Boole was a mathematician, philosopher, and logician who worked on differential equations (no big deal). While it was not his focus or intention, in attempting to help systemize Aristotelian logic, Boole inadvertently started a movement that would completely replace it. To put this into perspective, Aristotelian logic had been dominant for over 2,000 years. What Boole did was essentially the mathematical equivalent of Copernicus beginning to realize that maybe the Earth was not the center of the universe.\nAt the time of Boole, Artiotilian logic used syllogistic arguments and deductive reasoning to prove something. For example,\nAll men are mortal.Socrates is a man.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\nThis seems to work well, though Boole wanted to help it a bit by adding truth values to logic, such as \u201CFalse\u201D, \u201CTrue\u201D, \u201Cand\u201D, \u201Cor,\u201D, \u201Csome\u201D, and, \u201Call\u201D. Thereby removing some ambiguity to logical arguments that can arise and making logical arguments more similar to the way algebra describes numerical operators.\nNext came Georg Cantor (1845\u20131918), a German mathematician who pioneered Set Theory, now a central part of Computer Science and the cornerstone of modern mathematics. As the name suggests, Set Theory studies collections of objects. It\u2019s extremely difficult to explain the significance of Set Theory, especially because the idea of objects and numbers being a collection of sets seems nothing more than stupidly obvious. That, paired with the fact that Set Theory is actually incredibly dense and complicated, makes it challenging to explain Cantor\u2019s contribution. Because I can\u2019t even quite find a good way to explain it simply, I\u2019ve asked my good friend ChatGPT to help simply explain Set Theory:\n{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \u2026}\nThe order in which the elements of a set are listed is not important, and repeated elements are not allowed. For example, the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is the same as the set {4, 3, 2, 1}, but it is different from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}. There are different types of sets, such as finite sets (sets with a finite number of elements), infinite sets (sets with an infinite number of elements), and empty sets (sets with no elements). Set Theory is the foundation of mathematics and is used in many different areas of study, including algebra, geometry, and topology.\nIn Set Theory, there are also various operations that can be performed on sets, such as union, intersection, and difference. The union of two sets is a set that contains all the elements of both sets. The intersection of two sets is a set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets. The difference of two sets is a set that contains the elements that are in one set but not in the other.\nThere are also several axioms, or fundamental principles, of Set Theory that are used to define the properties of sets and the operations that can be performed on them.\nKeep in mind, that was me asking to explain Set Theory in simple terms. Along with rebuilding a major cornerstone of math, Cantor\u2019s work on Set Theory set the stage for database structure and query languages, such as SQL.\nIf Boole and Cantor were the ones who began prepping the pieces for modern-day logic, math, and computer science, Gottlob Frege (1848\u20131925) was the master logician who put the puzzle together. Frege took the work of Boole and Cantor and pushed it forward to completely rewrite logic altogether, coming up with what\u2019s known as first-order logic.\nWhat first-order logic does is replace the syllogistic forms of logic altogether with quantifiable ones, using Boolean operators and Set Theory to make an argument. So instead of the argument,\nAll men are mortal.Socrates is a man.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\nFirst-order logic would say,\n\u201CThere exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man\u201D, Where \u201Cthere exists\u201D is a quantifier and \u201Cx\u201D is a variable.\nAnd because we can think of elements or objects as existing within a set, the predicates, \u201Cis a man\u201D and \u201Cis a male Homo Sapien\u201D can both be assigned to the same set, x, which eradicates many problems that Aristotelian logic would not have been able to withstand.\nAdditionally, while not a philosophical contribution, per se, Frege worked with and introduced heavy-weight philosophers Bertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951), who had lasting influences in the world of philosophy, logic, language, mathematics, and by extension, Computer Science. To take an example, these two philosophers worked to create a logically ideal language\u2014one that is rooted in mathematics and logic and would not be misled by mistakes made in natural language. Arguably, this is the same reason we call JavaScript, Python, C#, and the rest of them, languages.\nTo take it full circle, in 1937, a student by the name of Claude Shannon (1916\u20132001) wrote a thesis called \u201CA Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,\u201D using a lot of the work that Boole had put forward, which until then had no practical applications. Shannon realized he could create switching circuits based on Boolean operators, such as True (1) and False (0), now commonplace in the world of programming and computing.\nOf course, there were also many other people that played a large role in making modern-day computing into a reality, too many that could be listed here. However, many of the ideas that Computer Science is based on can be directly traced back to philosophers like Boole, Cantor, Frege, Russel, and Wittenstein (as well as several others), who spent their life rebuilding logic and mathematics from the ground up. So the next time you hear someone say that philosophy is useless, remember that devices, websites, and applications we take for granted today would not exist had it not been for philosophers!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

I used to think I had a pretty good understanding of what \u201Cgo with the flow\u201D meant, especially when testing in the development world!\nMy wife and I recently had our first child. You may already be smiling if you have had kids or have spent an extended time with a newborn! With the few minutes that are starting to creep back into our lives, I realize how much my day-to-day work has really helped prepare me for life at home with a newborn. Who knew that raising a newborn and testing in the dev world would have so much in common?!\nI am sure there are many more ways, but here are four that stood out to me:\nThe dev site can sometimes be a bit like the wild wild west. Every time you head in there, you never know what you are going to get. Kind of like changing those first few diapers; you open it up and have to be ready for whatever you may find. Most likely, it will not be what you were expecting!\nYou feel confident that everything is ready to go, right? We do everything we can to get every detail into our stories, so the developers and testers are prepared to do what they do best. Before a baby is born, especially with your first, there is a ton of prep that happens with setting up the house, reading books, etc. Luckily at the hospital, there are plenty of people to help guide you those first few days, but all of a sudden, they are like, \u201CSee you later and good luck\u201D Wait\u2026what do I do now?!? Your planning will help those first few days, but then you really have to embrace going with the flow as you navigate this new adventure.\nAutomated Testing is used frequently to help us out, and these tests are great as they test exactly what you want. However, can you really cover everything with those tests?!? Very quickly, as a new parent, you learn that if your newborn is upset, you need to change their diapers, feed them, snuggle them, or rock or walk them. All part of that initial plan. After all that, they still keep crying. Now what?!? Just like our automated testing, it is great to help you get started, but in the end, you still need to get creative and adapt on the fly to make when the initial plan only gets you so far!\nAs consistent as time is, your perception of time will change very quickly with a newborn. By the time you get them up, feed them, change them, spend some quality time with them, and finally get them down for a nap, you will wonder what happened to half of your day! Looking at the clock, it is already noon, and now you must repeat that whole cycle 10 minutes from now. The same applies to both developers and testers. You can get laser-focused on bug reproduction or troubleshooting a story; the next thing you know, the entire day is gone. In the end, 8 hours is still 8 hours, but when working with a newborn or in development, that 8 hours can go by quickly!\nIt\u2019s amazing how you can start to see your work in everyday tasks and everyday tasks in your work. The type of passion that influences your day-to-day much more than a paycheck. Passion is a trait that has always fit in well here at BizStream. As a tester, we try to control and standardize the development environment as much as we can with testing environments, automated testing, test plans, and test cases. Kids can come into your life and change how everything works in a good way, whether you like it or not! In the end, with kids or in the world of development, you have to adapt and master the fine art of \u201Cgoing with the flow.\u201D\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

They allow users to see multiple pieces of content in a single, compact space. This blog post will explore the creation of a simple, reactive, and effective carousel using the Swiper.js library and some best practices for writing JavaScript.\nSwiper is a popular and well-maintained library for creating carousels and other touch-based sliders. It has several features that make it an ideal choice for creating a carousel, including:\nTo use Swiper.js to create a carousel, you have two options for using the library:\nFirst, if you plan on isolating your carousel code into a .js file, then install the Swiper library into your project with Node Package Manager:\nYou can see how to use this installed package later in this tutorial in the Custom Example implementation section.\nAlternatively, if you would like to serve the Swiper library from a CDN in your HTML file, you can use the following initialization code to import the required styles and JavaScript. Then, insert your Swiper initialization code and specify your desired options.\nWith your Swiper object now initialized, you can create a carousel by adding a \u003Cdiv\u003E element with the class \u201Cswiper-container\u201D to your HTML. Here is an example of how you might build the rest of a simple carousel:\nInside the \u201Cswiper-container\u201D \u003Cdiv\u003E element, we add another \u003Cdiv\u003E element with the class swiper-wrapper to wrap the group of slides. We then add a \u003Cdiv\u003E element with the class swiper-slide for each slide in the carousel. From here, it\u2019s up to you what goes in them!\nNext, we add two additional \u003Cdiv\u003E elements to hold the pagination and navigation buttons (optional). We specify these elements using the pagination and navigation options when we create a new Swiper instance using the Swiper constructor.\nA plethora of customizations are available for your Swiper instance. These range from changing the number of shown slides to modifying the class names for wrapper HTML elements. For more information on instance-specific customizability, check out the Swiper API documentation here:\nSwiper API Documentation\nWhen working with Swiper.js or any other JavaScript library, it is necessary as a modern developer to follow best practices to ensure that your code is maintainable, efficient, and easily approachable. Here are a few tips for writing clean and effective JavaScript:\nWe have seen basic Swiper code and taken a look at JavaScript best practices. Now let us take a quick look at a complex carousel implementation: a timeline web component. Here is a short gif demonstrating a client-requested timeline with full functionality:\nAs you can see, Swiper works effectively for any project requiring a responsive moving window of slides or cards. Additionally, most of the work behind creating this timeline was the styling portion and interfacing links with Modaal, another JavaScript library that creates the modal functionality seen in the gif above. Here is the custom element Swiper initialization code used for this production-ready timeline:\nSince we are using custom elements, we can now define a timeline anywhere in our HTML simply:\nAs you can see, even in complex situations, the Swiper library is easy to use. It requires minimal JavaScript, so you can focus more on styling your sliding web components than dealing with daunting vanilla JavaScript.

{"id":"329","pageTitle":"HTSFFVIK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-simplify-form-field-validations-in-kentico/","text":"How to Simplify Form Field Validations in Kentico\nData Annotations for validations are an easy way to create a validation that can be used for multiple fields or properties quickly. It can save time and keep code cleaner to do validations on data using these Data Annotations.\nThese Data Annotations are Decorations that look like tags for methods, fields, and properties. Some commonly used Decorations for fields and properties are [Required], [MaxLength], and [MinLength]. Decorations aren\u2019t limited to just fields or properties, they can also be used on methods. This is commonly seen in controllers such as [HttpPost], [HttpGet], [Authorize], and [ValidateAntiforgeryToken]. Even the class for an API controller may be decorated with the [Route] attribute to specify how the controller and its methods should be found.\nSometimes, we need to validate a field in a way that isn\u2019t handled out of the box, or sometimes we just want a little more control over the messages from the validation. There are plenty of reasons to create a custom validation, and they aren\u2019t all that scary. Let\u2019s say for password validation, there are four different requirements:\nThis can be handled with a single Regex, but the error message for each part of the validation will not let the user know exactly which requirement was not met. However, the Regex Data Annotation only allows one instance per field/property, so it\u2019s not possible to add one for each individual error message.\nWe have a couple of different solutions here; we could create a validation attribute for a custom regex validation that allows multiple attributes to be applied to a single field or create a custom attribute that contains the regex already but returns the error message for each regex condition if it does not exist. I prefer the latter, as modifying this later will be easier if the validation requirements change. Since the Regex validation is done in the data annotation logic, only the attribute would need to be modified to update the password validation for any password using this attribute. Creating an attribute that takes in a regex validation and allows multiple would be helpful in places where there may be a need to have different Regex validations, likely for something that is not a password.\nBefore I create the attribute, I want to separate the validation itself. This way, if there is any reason to do a password validation outside of the attribute itself, it can be called on any string as an extension. This will go in a PasswordValidationExtension in the same location as other extensions for the project. For each of the error messages, I am going to be using Kentico resource strings so they are easy to maintain if the site owners ever want to change them.\nWith the logic for the password validation out of the way, the attribute can be created to be used for the password validation. To make a class usable as an attribute, that class needs to inherit from the ValidationAttribute class. Then add the AttributeUsage attribute, and the types it will target. Attributes can target other types as well, including methods. This can be used to describe the method or prevent execution of the method, like the [ValidateAntiforgeryToken] or [AuthorizeAttribute]. Below is the PasswordValidationAttribute, which goes in a location for all custom validations in the project.\nFor attributes that need to be applied multiple times, add AllowMultiple=true in the AttributeUsage decoration for the class being used as an attribute. This validation does not need to be applied multiple times to the same field, but below is what it would look like for an Attribute that would.\nAll that\u2019s left now is to decorate the fields needing validation with the newly created Data Annotation. That annotation then validates the field and will pass the errors to the front end if there are any. The override for IsValid tells the attribute how to validate the field or property this Data Annotation is on. This is the method that needs to be overridden with custom logic when creating any custom validation. The override for FormatErrorMessage is only needed if the message will need to be formatted. The ErrorMessage property is inherited from the ValidationAttribute class, so setting this field on validation without overriding the FormatErrorMessage method will still work if you wish to define the error message in the Attribute itself.\nAny property with a Data Annotation will be validated automatically when a form is submitted with this property. Any errors that are caught in validation will invalidate the model state, allowing us to stop the submission before any other logic is run. We can then return the same view to the user, and the model state will contain the error messages needed to let the user know which form fields need attention. Now, a password can not be submitted into a form without having the four requirements from earlier. If any requirement is missing, the form is returned with a custom error message letting the user know which requirement their password did not meet.\nThis process can be used to validate any property. Change the name of the data annotation, change the logic for the validation, define the error message, and apply it to a property. Using a custom Data Annotation allows us to cover validations that are unique to an application. In this scenario, the validation could have been handled through a single Regex, but I needed more control over the error messages. With this validation, I am performing the same Regex match but updating the error specifically to what requirement(s) are missing. If my password meets 2 of the four requirements, the two missing requirements will be displayed in the returned form. This is less confusing for the user while still being clean in the backend.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

I, unfortunately, realize now that I may not have fully understood how to create and implement a strong team culture when I had the opportunity in the past.\nTeam culture is a major factor in running a successful business. In this post-pandemic world, it is more important than ever to have the right people on board to achieve the company goals and to surround yourself to accomplish your own personal goals. To put it bluntly, I feel the best compliment to cultural success is having your team in the office working together more days than not.\nHere are a few points that I feel help build a thriving team culture and a successful business:\nIn short, I do believe that having a team-oriented culture that works mostly in-office is the best strategy for success, both professionally and personally.

Doing so will make the website better for everyone.\nUsers of websites and online tools are often very different in age, education, cultural background, and more. They have different levels of experience with computers and mobile devices and often have different physical characteristics that affect how they interact with technology (color blindness, physical handicap, etc.). But at the end of the day, they just want to complete their intended action on the website and be on their way. This core similarity is what designing for accessibility is all about. Making websites easier for all users to access the information they\u2019re looking for.\nDesigns are always created within a set of constraints; client needs, budget, timeline, scope, etc. Accessibility issues are just an additional set of constraints that need to be considered while creating a design. Many designers working with accessibility constraints for the first time may think that these constraints will make their designs less interesting, cluttered, or dull. This is not the case. Accessibility constraints instead lead to more creative and effective solutions that are a better experience for all of your users.\nThere are a variety of accessibility issues that may affect users of your website. Some key accessibility issues to consider while making design decisions include:\nIn addition, accessibility issues may not always be permanent. Users may have permanent, temporary, or situational accessibility issues. Microsoft has a handy inclusive design toolkit that highlights how inclusive design can benefit users. Included within is a helpful table about different types of temporary and permanent accessibility issues (shown below).\nRemember, making your website or app more accessible makes it more useful for everyone.

{"id":"334","pageTitle":"EWDAR","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/essential-web-dev-accessibility-resources/","text":"Essential Web Dev Accessibility Resources\nIf you are just beginning to learn about web accessibility, then you have landed in the right place. This article will not teach you how to develop accessible websites, which is far beyond the scope of just one blog post, but the goal is to outline some of the core web accessibility resources available. Even if you are already familiar with web accessibility, my hopes are that you will still find some valuable resources in this article that will help you develop accessible websites and/or test your websites to ensure they are accessible. Let\u2019s dive in!\nThe World Wide Web Consortium has a ton of information on web accessibility, as they are the international community that develops the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG. The WCAG is currently in version 2.1, with version 2.2 in draft. The goal of the WCAG is to provide \u201Ca single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally,\u201D and it explains how to make web content accessible. So, when trying to find out how to make content on your website accessible, the WCAG is the source of truth. The guidelines in the WCAG have testable success criteria, which are used by accessibility experts and testing tools. Being familiar with the WCAG and knowing how to find the success criteria for these guidelines is of great importance when it comes to web accessibility, which brings us to the first and probably most important resource, the WCAG Quick Reference. The WCAG Quick Reference provides information to aid in understanding each guideline, as well as sufficient techniques to fulfill the success criteria of each guideline. You can also filter by the three levels of success criteria, which is very handy for narrowing down the guidelines based on the level you are trying to pass.\nAnother really useful resource is the W3C tutorials page. On this page, they have tutorials, with code examples, on how to develop various web content that is accessible. The tutorials include page structure, menus, images, tables, forms, and carousels. Within the tutorials, the W3C includes links back to the related Success Criteria of the WCAG, which helps to understand exactly why each component needs to be developed in a particular way.\nWhile testing tools cannot catch everything on a web page that isn\u2019t accessible, they are a good first step and the first line of defense to catch any web content that isn\u2019t accessible, for example, an image tag that doesn\u2019t have an alt attribute.\nLighthouse is a built-in tool in the Chrome dev tools. If you navigate to a web page you want to test, open up the developer tools (right-click and select \u201Cinspect\u201D), and select the Lighthouse tab. Lighthouse has many different tests that can be run, but for our purposes, we are interested in the Accessibility report.\nClicking the \u201CAnalyze page load\u201D will reload the page. Once the page has finished loading, Lighthouse generates an accessibility report. It will give the page an accessibility score as well as a list of suggestion that points to the HTML element in question.\nAnother useful tool similar to Lighthouse is the axe DevTools Chrome extension. The free version does virtually the same thing as Lighthouse, which will scan a page and point out the HTML element(s) that don\u2019t pass particular WCAG success criteria. The paid version is much more robust and allows you to run Guided Tests that will allow you to test things like keyboard functionality and interactive elements.\nLike I mentioned above, these testing tools are great first lines of defense, but they cannot catch everything due to the various ways that web content can be developed. Therefore, having a web accessibility specialist audit your site is the best way to ensure the web content of your site uses sufficient techniques to meet the success criteria of the WCAG.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"335","pageTitle":"Question Everything","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/question-everything/","text":"Question Everything\nQuestion Everything, even if it represents generations of conventional wisdom.\nWhen the global pandemic made its debut in early March of 2020, no one could have predicted what kind of profound impact it would have on the workplace. What started as a two-week initiative to \u201Cslow the curve\u201D turned into a prolonged experiment in working remotely and somehow still attempting to balance the metaphorical work/life scales. Many businesses couldn\u2019t adapt to this change and closed up shop soon after the lockdown was initiated, while others seemed to thrive.I\u2019m not going to paint the lockdown in a positive light. It was brutal for all of us. Especially for BizStream, where we pride ourselves on our unique and \u201CNationally recognized\u201D culture that includes many social gatherings, team outings, and even the occasional trip to the Bartesian (think Keurig but for alcoholic cocktails). But if I were to look at this large glass of COVID milk as half full, I recognize that we did pick up some decent habits along the way.\nIn hindsight, the COVID lockdown was one big forced social experiment. It took us all well out of our comfort zones. I remember gripping and grasping for a sense of normalcy as one week of lockdown turned into one month, one quarter, and eventually one full year. We weren\u2019t really given a choice. You either adapt, or you wallow in self-pity. When you are forced into change, a lot of good can come out of it. We began to realize that work can still happen remotely. That a company is not defined by a brick-and-mortar building but by an amalgamation of people working together through trust building teams. We found new platforms for social engagement. New ways of approaching workloads and even better creative ways of praising each other for the work we are so humbly proud of. But above all, it taught us the importance of challenging societal norms both inside and outside of the workplace.\nOkay, enough pandemic talk. It\u2019s now 2022, and we are back in the office with our newfound knowledge, which extends far beyond using hand sanitizer ten times a day. Even before the pandemic, our leadership at BizStream would often remind us to question everything. Question our processes. Our tech stacks. Question why we work five day work weeks.. As a collaborative unit, we are encouraged to ask questions, challenge \u201Cstandards,\u201D and bring new ideas to the table. Don\u2019t complain just to complain. That hinders progress, and you will be put into the cone of shame..\nThis is not a new thing for us, but quite honestly, we weren\u2019t very good at it up until recently. Shortly after our teams began funneling back into the office, we carried with us a new sense of urgency to challenge the status quo and embrace change. We learned through 2020 and 2021 that life is too damn short not to try new things.\nWe used to host a monthly event called \u201CLab Day.\u201D On the last Friday of every month, our team would work on non-client work and focus on either learning something new or building a \u201CShippable\u201D product by the end of the day. It was a good idea in theory, and the event had been around since I started at BizStream back in 2016, so naturally, it was here to stay\u2026 Right?\nI had started to notice a trend where many developers were choosing to utilize this day to catch up on client work. But why? What had happened to this \u201Ccoveted\u201D monthly perk? We tried other ways to rejuvenate this \u201Chistorical artifact\u201D of an event, but it just wasn\u2019t working. I decided to send out a Google Poll to the entire team to get a sense of how people felt about it, and the results were pretty conclusive. Just as Harrison Ford desperately grasped for the holy grail as it teetered on the edge of oblivion, Sean Connery looked lovingly into our eyes and smiled down from heaven as he said, \u201CLet it Go.\u201D\nSo that\u2019s what we did. A little self-examination goes a long way, folks. We put the pause on lab day, which forced our collective group to think about how we could repurpose this perk into something a little more useful.\nOver the last year, we had been hearing a lot of reports on companies experimenting with the four-day workweek. In hindsight, it seemed to be fate that BizStream was primed for this specific experiment. We had just determined that lab days were on their way out, AND we knew from our COVID experience that we had ironed out a lot of the inefficiencies and quirks associated with remote work. The foundation was set.It seemed very doable. It would not be met without some challenges, of course, but that wasn\u2019t the point. We wanted to try something new. We challenged not only ourselves but societal norms about the \u201CAmerican five-day workweek.\u201DFor the first time in BizStream history, we closed up shop every Friday for the months of June, July, and August in 2022. Now I won\u2019t sugarcoat the end results. The perks were easy to observe right out the gate, but we also discovered many unique challenges that tested our management team in new ways, but that\u2019s not really the point of this post. We examined an issue, questioned the status quo, and put forth a new experiment that would challenge the norm. We were successful in that, and we learned so much along the way.\nLife is too short to go through the motions. What makes working with and for BizStream is that it\u2019s full of like-minded individuals who love to try new things. Some of our experiments fail. Most succeed. We push ourselves with exciting new tech stacks, agile methodologies, four-day work weeks, and cocktails that we make up on the spot. Just another day in the life of a BizStreamer.\n\u0022An unexamined life is not worth living.\u0022\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

Well, that\u2019s not a problem because you will find out.\nYou can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes. Why not use the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that Bing and Office have used for more than a decade into your site? Maybe AI can make it \u201Cjust\u201D work.\nBrian will also demonstrate how having a Headless CMS, like Kontent.ai, to source search index data is a powerful combination when it comes to search experience on your website.\nWednesday, October 123:00 PM \u2013 3:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time\nIn-person tickets are sold out for the event at the Seattle Conference Center, but you can still join us online.

{"id":"337","pageTitle":"F\u002BAATFOUDT","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/figma-adobe-and-the-future-of-ux-design-tools/","text":"Figma \u002B Adobe and the Future of UX Design Tools\nIn September of 2022, Adobe announced its intent to acquire the popular UX design application, Figma. This sent shockwaves throughout the design community, and many of us are very curious to see how these two design powerhouses come together.\nAdobe has been the primary provider of industry standard design software for decades; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, After Effects, and many more. There are a variety of competitors out there, but no single competitor has the breadth of product offering, large user base, or intercompatibility that Adobe and its products have.\nBut then there\u2019s Figma. Over the last several years, Figma has grown to be a hugely popular UX design program. So much so that many agencies and designers have switched to using Figma entirely for their web, product, and graphic design needs. I myself was a latecomer to Figma and its wonderful qualities, but I\u2019m glad I came around when I did.\nAdobe\u2019s primary competing product, XD, does many of the same things Figma does. But most of those things Figma does better and more seamlessly. Many users of Figma were proud of the fact that it was an independent product, not made by Adobe. So that there was more competition and innovation in the design software space. To me, this is the single most important aspect of the whole deal. Many of the innovations and features of the Figma application were only possible because it was created outside of the Adobe ecosystem. Many of these features had been requested by users in Adobe\u2019s apps for years with little to no progress from Adobe.\nAdobe made the initial announcement with a blog post and a press release. Figma also announced the acquisition on its blog. This deal is huge news. Not only is Adobe buying one of the most popular independent software developers, but they are willing to pay an incredible amount for it, \u201Capproximately $20 billion in cash and stock.\u201D Whoa. That\u2019s almost five times what Disney paid to acquire all of Lucasfilm; Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Industrial Light \u0026 Magic, and so much more\u2026 granted, that deal was in 2012. But to put that into perspective, Figma didn\u2019t even release its closed beta until 2015. So, in just about seven years, Figma was able to grow its valuation to five times that of Lucasfilm. No matter how you look at it, $20 billion is an insane amount of money.\nWhat\u2019s next for Adobe and Figma? Only they know right now. As of this writing, the deal hasn\u2019t officially closed, and Adobe and Figma haven\u2019t announced specifics for how their tools will be integrated together. (Will Figma and XD merge into one program? Which features of each program will be kept, and which will be removed?) The obvious hope is that the strongest features of each tool will be combined to make a superior product to what each was on its own.\nAt this point, I choose to be optimistic. Having a set of design applications that all work well together is really handy when working on large design projects. By bringing Figma into Creative Cloud, Adobe makes its suite of design tools even stronger. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve found Figma\u2019s implementation of features more in line with what users ask for and more timely to the needs of the design community. Above all, I hope that Figma\u2019s spirit of innovation isn\u2019t lost in the merger. I don\u2019t think Adobe would invest $20 billion into a product just to squander all of its current and future potential.\nAs creatives, we use our preferred design tools every day. We rely on them and put a lot of trust in them. So, when they change, it can be jarring. But we adapt; that\u2019s what we do. Let\u2019s hope Adobe\u2019s purchase of Figma turns out to be an overall positive for the design community.\nCheck out projects we\u2019ve created with Adobe and Figma\u2019s tools.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"339","pageTitle":"KPBSOTRTA(S","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/kentico-page-builder-section-one-to-rule-them-all-variable-section/","text":"Kentico Page Builder Section: One to Rule Them All (Variable Section)\nIterating upon one of my previous blog posts about complex sections and widgets has put me on an unexpected journey to build one Page Builder section to rule them all. One section for almost every layout a content administrator could ask for. I\u2019m utilizing Kentico 13\u2019s property visibility conditions to only show the properties that content admins need to see.\nThe Generic Column Section was a good starting point. One section that allows up to five columns with equal widths. An initial improvement I made to this section was adding an option to allow a sixth column.\nI made another section to handle any percentage of two-column layouts. This section replaced the need for 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, or any other combination of two columns. As long as the content admin configures the column widths to be at or below 100%, then everything will look good.\nIn my head, I wanted to make a three-column adjustable section similar to the two-column one. With those three sections, I think most layouts would be covered.\nAfter upgrading a client\u2019s site to K13 they wanted to start utilizing page builder. Their first request was to make one section that handled the previously three mentioned sections and even more features all in one section. They wanted each column to have its own border styles, padding, and text color properties. Initially, I was hesitant to the request because the sheer amount of properties on this section would be overwhelming to content admins. I suggested breaking this into three sections, but they were adamant about keeping everything in one.\nWith the acceptance criteria defined, I set forth on my journey to forge them the section they desired. I began with defining all the properties in the VariableSectionProperties.cs class.\nI leveraged the Builder Visibility Conditions to ensure only the required properties display based on the ColumnCount dropdown. For example, when the user selects 2-3 columns, those columns will have a width property displaying, but when a user selects 4 or above, the custom visibility conditions tell those width properties they shall not pass, hiding them. 4-6 columns are all equal-width columns based on the client\u2019s request.\nThe BaseSectionProperties is where I put properties that are shared across any section I build. Properties like margin, padding, IsFullBleed, and background color are in this file.\nThe custom visibility condition uses a range value to display properties. The DependeePropertyValue is the ColumnCount property value. As content admins update the ColumnCount the properties will update dynamically.\nRendering the section is about as easy as Frodo\u2019s quest would\u2019ve been if Gandalf called upon the Eagles from the beginning. I removed bootstrap from the Generic Column Section I started with. Now we\u2019re using flexbox with custom classes to be able to override the default column widths easier.\nIn the stylesheet for the variable section, we\u2019re utilizing media queries to set an override for mobile styling. The 1-3 column(s) are stacking and having their width set to 100%, and the 4-6 columns are stacking in a two-column layout.\nI think this variable section is a great foundation to keep iterating on for years to come. I have a few thoughts on how to expand the functionality of this section. One of the features I would like to add is a IsAccordion boolean to the section and each column in the section.I also plan to add this section to the Kentico Marketplace and GitHub. I\u2019ll probably look into doing this after adding the additional features.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"340","pageTitle":"TTAFICW.6","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/timer-triggered-azure-functions-in-c-with-net-6/","text":"Timer Triggered Azure Functions in C# with .NET 6\nSo, first, let\u2019s set the stage. At BizStream, we have a Pulse meeting with the entire group every Monday morning. It\u2019s a general review of the company\u2019s heartbeat, and one of the topics covered in this meeting is who is out of the office. This conversation is a general overview of who is on PTO that week or the following Monday. This is useful to get a glance at the week in general. However, things change after Monday. Or sometimes, I just don\u2019t remember all the names from the Pulse meeting.\nI thought \u2013 \u201Cit\u2019d be nice to be able to pull up Slack and see a daily message of who is on PTO for a given day.\u201D So, that\u2019s what I made. We will walk through creating and deploying a\u00A0timer-triggered Azure Function\u00A0that accomplishes just this. We will walk through using a Key Vault to store the secrets needed for the API calls in a secure manner, and then we will cover remote debugging of your newly created Azure Function App.\nIn this post, we will not be covering gathering data using the REST API from TMetric or creating a Slack app for sending a message to a channel \u2013 which I did via a webhook URL for the Slack app. I also used RestSharp and Newtonsoft.Json for data consumption. You could consume any API for data you\u2019d like and create a Slack message out of it if you aren\u2019t sure what might be useful for you.\nBefore you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:\nYou also need an Azure account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.\nWe will first need to create a Resource Group in Azure. Search for Resource Groups and select Resource groups from the results. On the Resource groups page, click Create.\nSelect your subscription and type in a name for the resource group, I named mine PTO, but you can call it what you\u2019d like. Choose a Region, typically the one that is closest to your current time zone.\nNext, we need to create a Storage Account. You can follow the same process of searching for Storage Accounts, clicking on it, and selecting Create. The same subscription is most likely pre-selected but verify the correct subscription is selected. You will want to choose the resource group that we just created in the last step. Type in any name that you would like. You want to select the same region you set for your resource group. Standard Performance will work for this use case. Since this isn\u2019t an important application, you\u2019ll want to change the Redundancy to Locally-redundant storage (LRS).\nLet\u2019s head back to the search bar, type in Function App, and select it. Click create and fill in the details. Select the same subscription and resource group as before\u2014type in a name for your Function App. We will be using .NET 6 and deploying to the same region we were using before. It will be a Windows OS, and the Plan type is Consumption (Serverless).\nClick Next: Hosting and select the storage account that was just created in the previous step. Click Next: Networking and Next: Monitoring (or use the tabbed navigation to go to Monitoring). On the Monitoring tab, select No for Enable Application Insights. Now you can select Review \u002B Create.\nAfter it is created and the deployment has finished successfully, click on the Go to resource button. Once the resource page has loaded and you see the Overview section, identify the heading Functions, select Functions on the left navigation, and click on it.\nLet\u2019s open VS Code and do a little Azure from there, shall we?\nIn your new window of VS Code, go to the Azure tab on the left-hand navigation \u2013 assuming the Azure tools extension has been installed. In VS Code, you\u2019ll also need to be signed in to your Microsoft Azure account with the subscription to the resource group and storage account we created in the previous steps.\nTo sign in, you can press Ctrl \u002B Shift \u002B P to open the Command Palette in VS Code, start typing Azure Sign in, and select the option. You should also see an option to sign in under the Azure panel, which we will get to in the next step.\nChoose the Azure icon in the Activity bar. In the Azure panel, under Workspace, click the plus button and select Create Function.\nYou shouldn\u2019t have any projects listed here yet; there will be a pop-up asking you to create or open an existing project \u2013 select Create new project.\nSelect a location where you\u2019d like to store the project locally. VS Code will then walk you through creating the Function locally so you can code from VS Code (or Visual Studio, more on that later). In the command palette, select C#.\nContinue selecting the following options as you create the project:\nAfter entering the cron expression, it will ask to select a storage account for debugging and internal use. You can emulate a local instance or select an existing storage account. In this scenario, you will select the storage account we created earlier. In the command palette, choose the subscription under which you created the storage account, and then select the storage account. Open the new project in the current window.\nOnce the project is created and opened, you may be missing some necessary dependencies. There should be a notification from VS Code saying there are unresolved dependencies. Click Restore.\nYou can install the dependencies manually if you don\u2019t get the notification. To do so, run a dotnet add package command in the terminal. Or, if you have the NuGet Package Manager GUI extension installed in VS Code, you can also install it with that tool.\ndotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs \u2013version 3.0.33\nYour new timer trigger function is ready for editing. The template should look something like this:\nAt this point, I already had a console application with working code for my TMetric and Slack calls. I recreated the classes and services in the newly created Function App.\nThe models I have mainly represent the JSON objects I am getting back from TMetric. After getting the data for who is on PTO today, I then build an appropriate string to send to the Slack webhook URL.\nYou will want to store your keys and secrets in the local.settings.json file for local development purposes. To read these values, you will want to use the Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(string variable) method. Below is the code from my Slack Service to get the webhook URL\u2019s value.\nUse this to store and access any secrets you need for your API calls for testing locally. When we are ready for testing, it\u2019s easy to debug locally. Open Run from the menu and select Start Debugging (or press F5).\nHowever, you\u2019ll not want to track your local.settings.json in Git or publish them to Azure. You might be wondering; how do we securely store and access our secrets in our Azure Function App when deployed?\nAzure has an excellent tool for solving this problem, and that is using a Key Vault. Before creating the Key Vault, we must enable system-assigned managed identity for our Function App.Let\u2019s head back to Azure for a little bit to do that. Navigate to the Function App. Under Settings, click on Identity.\nOn the Identity blade, under the System assigned tab, change the Status to On and click Save. The system will generate an identity for you \u2013 click Yes on the subsequent popup asking to assign the managed identity.\nNow that we have an identity to provide permissions, we need to make a Key Vault. In the search bar, type Key Vaults and select it from the results. On the Key Vaults page, click on Create.\nOn the Create a Key Vault blade, select the subscription and resource group that you\u2019ve been using. Enter a name for the key vault. Use the same region your other resources have used and leave the pricing tier set to Standard.\nClick Next: Access Policy and then click Add Access Policy.\nYou can leave the template drop-down blank on the Add Access Policy blade. Add Secret permissions for Get and List. Open the selection for Principal and search for the name of your Function App. Click on the name of the Function App and then click the Select button towards the bottom. Then click Add.\nAfter that, we are ready to Review \u002B create. After the creation and deployment of the key vault are complete, go to the resource. In the left navigation, under Settings, click on Secrets.\nOn the Secrets blade, generate as many as needed for the keys and secrets your Function App needs. After creating each, you want to click on the secret version, copy the Secret Identifier, and paste it into Notepad. You\u2019ll need these in a moment.\nNow that we have our key vault with our secrets and permission to access the Function App, we need to create the application settings that correspond to those secrets in the Function App. Go to the Function App and click on Configuration under Settings in the left navigation menu. Under Application Settings, click on New application setting.\nName these settings the same as what you named your settings in your local.settings.json so that your environment variable names don\u2019t need to change in your function code. The value will be @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=\u003Cthe-secret-identifier-link\u003E) where the \u003Cthe-secret-identifier-link\u003E should be replaced with the corresponding identifiers you copied into Notepad.\nOnce these have been entered, save the settings before leaving the page.\nWhile we are here entering settings, there is another setting we should add for our timer trigger to occur when we expect it to. By default, serverless Azure Function Apps that use timer triggers will use UTC. We need to add another setting, WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE, if we want more control. I am on Eastern Standard Time, although you can find the list of time zones here. Make sure to save the application settings again.\nIt\u2019s time to put together the timer trigger function. The framework was created already, but we need to clean out the Run method.\nNext, you will want to put together the logic that makes sense for the type of message you are creating (if you are putting together a similar app). Below is my Run method.\nI want to point out that I have updated my method to an async method and the return type of Task. I am running some async methods for the API calls and Azure Blob storage integrated into the function.\nNow that you are ready to deploy something working, go ahead and deploy it to the Function App we created earlier. In VS Code, open the Azure panel again. Under Workspace, click the Deploy button and select Deploy to Function App.\nThe command palette will pop up. Make sure to select your subscription where you\u2019ve created your Resource Group and Storage Account, and then you will select the Function App you want to deploy to. After your selections, you will need to confirm the deployment, as it will overwrite any previous deployment and cannot be undone.\nThe output of the process will be shown in the terminal in VS Code. Let\u2019s look at the function in Azure. Go to the Function App that we deployed to. Click on Functions in the left-side navigation, and you should see the timer trigger function you created and deployed.\nDepending on the time you set for the cron expression in your trigger, you may want to test your function but not wait for it to execute. Click on the function name and then click on Code \u002B Test on the function blade under the Developer section. On the Code \u002B Test blade, click the Test/Run button to open another blade to the right. You can click run here to execute your function whenever you\u2019d like.\nIf you experience issues or things do not work as they did locally during your testing, you may want to do some remote debugging. There are a few ways to debug your function remotely, but I will show you what I have personally found as the easiest way to debug. You\u2019ll need Visual Studio 2022 for this technique.\nTo use VS2022 to debug remotely, you will need to ensure the Azure development features are installed. If you are freshly installing VS2022, you can select Azure development during the installation. If you already have VS2022 installed, you can modify your installation by going to Tools \u003E Get Tools and Features, checking Azure development, and clicking Install while downloading.\nAfter ensuring you have the Azure SDKs, click File \u003E Open \u003E Project/Solution and select the project file in your function\u2019s repository on your local system. This will create a solution file for you, so you can easily open the project in VS Code or Visual Studio if you have a preference.In the file menu, click on Build and select Publish.\nThere will be a Publish pop-up asking you where you want to publish. Click on Azure for the Target and select Azure Function App (Windows) for the Specific Target.\nNext, you will need to sign into your Azure account. Then, on the Functions instance, leave View as Resource Group. Under Function Apps, expand the Resource Group and select the Function App you created and published from VS Code. Then click Finish.Now you have a Publish profile synced with your Azure subscription and the Function App you want to remote debug. On the Publish window, to hit breakpoints, you will need to adjust the publish from Release to Debug. You can edit the configuration by clicking the pencil and changing the Configuration to Debug.\nAfter saving the configuration, go ahead and click the Publish button. You will see the logs of the publish populate the Output window. You will see a successful message upon completion.\nNow you are ready to start a remote debugging session. To do this, under the Hosting group, click the ellipses (\u2026) and select Attached debugger.\nVisual Studio will do the work of attaching to the Function App in Azure and allows you to debug from within the deployment environment. It may take a moment before it connects, but you can set breakpoints where necessary to debug your application.If you get the error that the Azure resource is not available, then you most likely need to go to Account settings in VS 2022 and sign back into your Azure account.\nThat was a basic approach to creating a timer triggered Function App in Azure. There are additional types of triggers, and you can create much more elaborate functions and workflows to accomplish business tasks. For example, you could use a Blob trigger to process invoices from your e-commerce website into another system, such as an ERP system. Functions are great ways to offload unnecessary overhead with your applications.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"344","pageTitle":"CKCE","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/kontent-ai-custom-elements/","text":"Creating Kontent.ai Custom Elements\nKontent.ai is a robust and easy-to-use Headless Content Management System. One of the great features of Kontent.ai is its extensibility through Custom Elements. These custom elements are simply separate, self-hosted web applications that can connect to Kontent.ai using the Custom Elements JS API. This allows integration with any other system and the ability to create any type of custom editing experience as long as it can be implemented in another web application.\nTo demonstrate how custom elements work, we will walk through how to implement a web page that generates a random color using an external API. First, we will create a project using npm. Then we need to create a simple server to host our page. Then we will create our page and client-side code for the UI, external API integration, and connection to Kontent.ai.\nWe will outline the code for each step of the process as we go, but if you want to see the complete source code, it is hosted in BizStream\u2019s GitHub repository here.\nTo set up a new project make sure to have Node and npm installed (or a similar package manager, like yarn). Note that setting up a project using npm is not necessary in order to have a working Kontent.ai element, but we will create one here so that we can easily install packages and host our element locally for testing using Node.\nAfter verifying that Node is installed, run the following in the command line:\nFollow the prompts or accept the defaults as desired, and a new package.json file will be generated. Here is an example of the one we generated:\nFor the web app and the main functionality of our Kontent.ai element, we will create a basic web page. We will also use Alpine to help us add functionality quickly for the UI.\nHere is the markup, saved to index.html:\nColor Name:\nThis simple page contains a div with the random background color, text showing a random color name, and a button we can use to fetch new random colors.\nNext, we need to add the code to make the UI interactive and allow querying the cloud service for random colors.\nFor querying the API we will use the fetch method implemented in all modern browsers.\nNow that the web app is completed, we need to be able to serve it up from a web server. As mentioned previously, we will use Node and Express, running locally, to handle this. Run npm install express \u2013save to install Express and save it as a dependency in our project.\nHere is the code we will use for our Express server, saved to the file server.js:\nWith both the web app and server written, the final step is to test it in Kontent.ai. Kontent.ai will show our web app in an iframe in the editor and communicate with our app using the iframe API mentioned previously. Kontent.ai also requires our app to be on a secure connection.\nWe can test this locally using Ngrok. Ngrok is a service that acts as a tunnel, and we can use it to point Kontent.ai to our computer and Node server running on localhost. First, enter node server.js to start our local server, then, in a separate command line instance, run ngrok HTTP localhost:8000 to get the tunnel set up:\nNgrok will then create and print a random, unique address for the tunnel. Copy the HTTPS address, which will be entered into Kontent.ai as the web location of our app.\nNow we need to create a new custom element in Kontent.ai and point it to our application. To do this, first log into Kontent.ai.\nTo make the custom element reusable for any content type we will create a new Content Type Snippet, under the Content model section. We have named our snippet Color Randomizer.\nWe will then add a Custom Element field. Upon adding this field, there are a few parameters that we can enter. The Hosted code URL (HTTPS) field is where we will paste the address created by Ngrok, which we copied in the previous step. There are also two other fields, which are used for specifying other Kontent.ai element names and holding configuration data, respectively. The element names are for Kontent.ai elements that the custom element code should be given access to. The configuration data, formatted as JSON, is for other data the web app can pull in and use if needed, such as API Keys or other initialization values. We will not need those for this example, so make sure to paste the Ngrok address into the respective field, save the snippet, and go back to the main Content Model section.\nNow, create a new model where our snippet and custom element will be used. We called our model Color Randomizer Demo. Add a Content Type Snippet element and select the snippet we created earlier from the drop-down.\nThe last and final step is to create an item that uses the custom element and see it in action. Go to the Content \u0026 Assets tab on the left, click the Create New button in the top-right corner and choose to create a new Color Randomizer Demo element.\nHere we can see that we start out with no color, but then as we click the button, new colors are randomly generated and saved in Kontent.ai. If we then Publish the element, the button becomes disabled, using the callback we implemented until we create a new version.\nThis is a simple example of what can be created using Custom Elements inside Kontent.ai, but it is an example of the freedom that developers have to create any kind of integration and editing experience, as long as it can be implemented and hosted in a web application. This is just one of the many reasons for choosing Kontent.ai as a Headless Content Management platform.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Welcome! Hopefully, I can alleviate many of the problems you might run into. Perhaps you don\u2019t know what CSP headers even are.\nRecently, we at BizStream have seen an uptick in the awareness and need for Content Security Policy headers on our clients\u2019 sites. Here, I will outline what I\u2019ve done to solve the issue of applying CSP headers to a pre-existing site.\nFrom MDN, Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement, to malware distribution.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a way to whitelist everything that your site uses as a safe resource, such that it will reject anything else. While its purpose is to protect your site from malicious attacks, it is only your first line of defense and is not intended to be a complete solution for preventing attacks. For a more in-depth explanation of Content Security Policy, you can check out Mike West and Joe Medley\u2019s article, An Introduction to Content Security Policy.\nFrom MDN, Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

While its purpose is to protect your site from malicious attacks, it is only your first line of defense and is not intended to be a complete solution for preventing attacks. For a more in-depth explanation of Content Security Policy, you can check out Mike West and Joe Medley\u2019s article, An Introduction to Content Security Policy.\nPolicy directives describe rules for a particular resource or policy area. For example, the following policy directive will allow content from the same domain and trusted.com, including all subdomains.\nI won\u2019t go over every available directive (there are a lot of them!). The best practice would be to set every available directive, if possible. The important ones to note are script-src and style-src. With the CSP Level 3 specification, we find a saving grace in the new strict-dynamic directive. This allows us to mark which inline scripts and styles are safe to run. Consequently, this also automatically marks scripts and styles inserted by the marked scripts as safe to run. For example, Google Tag Manager will insert analytics scripts when it initializes. If you\u2019re wondering about what a CSP level is, it\u2019s just the specification version. Level 3 is the latest iteration as of writing this blog post. If you\u2019re interested in reading up, you can go directly to the source from W3.\nWhen working with Kentico, there are quite a few hoops to jump through to ensure your site is secure. Unfortunately, to fully secure the Kentico Mother, we would need to edit the source files of Kentico. This is a big red flag for pain down the line when upgrading to the next Kentico version. Therefore, we are currently unable to secure the Kentico Mother with CSP and will need to create a bypass instead.\nAmongst finding all sources for our resources to add to our CSP headers, we have a small laundry list of things we need to add for our site to function with the CSP restrictions. My example was built in .NET Framework 4.8; the same concept is possible but built differently in .NET Core. However, The concepts should still carry over.\nHere\u2019s an outline of the things we need to do in order to secure our site:\nFirst, we can create the HtmlOutputFilter base class that our other filters will inherit in order to share the ability to parse and edit the HtmlOutput of our controllers.\nNext, we can build out our two filters to add nonces and remove the inline onsubmit event handlers.\nOn the topic of nonces, I should probably explain what these are a little. Nonces are a one-time use value. For CSP headers, we supply a nonce to the headers themselves and also add a nonce attribute to each inline script and style tag on our page. This way, the browser knows which inline elements to trust. If we were to statically define our nonces, they would be meaningless. An attacker could simply look at the nonce value, add it to their scripts, and inject their malicious scripts on the next request. What we are doing is using NWebsec to dynamically generate a nonce per request. That way, an attacker does not have a way to know the nonce beforehand.\nWe will also create a conditional filter that only applies our CSP headers and attributes when accessing data from the live site, ignoring the Kentico Mother. The conditional filter is a higher order function that will return the function to be used in the global filter provider. There are two lists of strings that let you configure subdomains or paths. They signify requests from the admin application. cmsctx/ is present for Form Builder. Be careful with the paths; otherwise, you may accidentally collide with a live site path and leave a vulnerability. For example, you might want to add admin/ to the path list. If you have an admin page on the live site, you will end up disabling CSP headers for that page.\nNow we will create a FilterConfig that will define the CSP headers and attributes to be used globally. We are utilizing NWebsec to add CSP headers to our responses.\nYou can check out these resources to learn more about the directives and CSP as a whole.\nContent Security Policy Reference, Content Security Policy (CSP)\nSomething to note, you can support older browsers that don\u2019t have full support by including self, unsafe-inline, http:, and https: in the script-src directive. These will be ignored as long as strict-dynamic is present. In browsers that don\u2019t support strict-dynamic the source will be ignored, and the other sources will be used instead.\nYou can also test your headers without preventing content from loading by using the ReportOnly equivalent of each attribute from NWebsec. Pairing this with the CspReportUriReportOnlyAttribute lets you post information on violations that would have occurred if the policy was active.\nIn the layout, we add an empty script with a manually applied nonce so that we can add it to the other styles and scripts in the HtmlOutput. We also add the event listener to replace the ones we removed with RemoveKenticoFormInlineEventHandlersFilter.cs.\nNow you can run your application! You may find that you missed a couple of spots, or your directives may be a bit too restrictive. This is a lot of trial and error. Each site is unique, so I can only help you so much. You may even run into issues I haven\u2019t experienced yet. To analyze the strength of your headers, you can use CSP Scanner. Overall, CSP headers can be quite a beast to conquer, especially if you\u2019re retrofitting the headers. Hopefully, this post helps make your life easier when trying to implement CSP into your application.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"347","pageTitle":"3SEJDNTS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/3-skills-every-junior-developer-needs-to-succeed/","text":"3 Skills Every Junior Developer Needs to Succeed\nAfter five (somewhat grueling) years of college, the day to finally begin my career as a junior web developer has arrived. In addition to being anxious to get started and build upon the knowledge I\u2019ve gained through college and other self-learning projects, I couldn\u2019t help but have countless questions running through my mind about what this experience would actually be like. Was I prepared enough? What would be expected of me? What level of knowledge did they hope for me to have? These may be similar to the thoughts you have as well.\nSo, the big question\u2026what really is expected of a junior web developer? It\u2019s been over six months since my first day as a junior web developer at BizStream, and I\u2019m here to give you answers to those questions.\nOkay, maybe not nothing, but starting out, it\u2019s a pretty mutual thought on both sides with not knowing what to expect. It\u2019s no secret that technology is changing daily, and it can be hard to keep up with \u2013 especially for someone who is just starting out. While searching for a job, one of my big concerns was that the company would expect me to know more than I actually knew. My ideal company to work for was one that could see my potential, and BizStream was that exact company.\nWhen I started working at BizStream, I was happy to see how much they were willing to invest in me. My first few weeks on the job focused on giving me a clear understanding of who BizStream is, like the projects they work on, the technologies they use, and the required training. When I finally started getting into development work, they didn\u2019t just throw me into the trenches. They began with paired programming and then moved me to my own tasks. BizStream has always been flexible when I ask for assistance when I get stuck on a problem, and everyone is always willing to extend a helping hand whenever I ask them for help.\nWhile it wasn\u2019t expected of me to know everything on my first day, I have learned a lot of things in these last few months that I think would have been helpful to know on my first day.\nWhile these are still great resources, when it became important for me to start learning more technologies quicker, the best way to do that was by referencing the technology\u2019s documentation. Since documentation is not written to give you the exact solution to every problem you run into, learning to comprehend documentation so that I can translate that into an appropriate solution was a bit of a learning curve for me.\nHowever, after six months of referencing some documentation almost daily, I can happily report that it\u2019s not much of a challenge for me anymore \u2013 it just takes consistent practice, as any newly learned trait does.\nNo matter your job, it\u2019s always important to have good communication skills. Communication allows everyone in the team to be on the same page and work to be completed in the most efficient way possible. From a junior web developer\u2019s point of view, communication will allow you to grow as a developer even quicker.\n\u200BAs I mentioned earlier in this post, you were hired for your potential. Be transparent about what you know and what you don\u2019t know. Your employer wants to see that you\u2019re willing to learn and put forth the effort to enable you to gain the skills necessary to make yourself and the company successful. When you run into a problem with a task you\u2019re working on and truly feel you\u2019ve tried everything to solve the problem, reach out to someone who can provide you with some help. In my experience, everyone is always happy to help when possible, and if the person you reach out to for help can\u2019t solve it, they will more than likely help you find someone who can give you the answers you\u2019re looking for.\nThere you have it, everything you need to know to make yourself a successful junior web developer. Okay, maybe not everything you need to know, but you\u2019re not expected to know everything, remember? At the end of the day, most of us starting a junior web developer role are fresh out of school or some other training that taught us to be a developer. In this role, your job is to mix being a student with being a professional, and sooner than you may realize, you\u2019re going to be in a position where you are the person a junior developer is approaching for advice.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"348","pageTitle":"BOPPWCN","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/balancing-our-proven-processes-with-customer-needs/","text":"Balancing Our Proven Processes With Customer Needs\nStarting a new project with a new client is always an interesting endeavor. In most cases, you take two separate teams with their own unique processes and workflows they are comfortable with, and join them together. Just as important as it is to determine what we are building, it is also essential to figure out how we will work together to make the project successful. What tools are we using? Where will information live? How will we communicate? Going through the phases of team development \u2013 Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning \u2013 while working together for the first time on a new project can easily add a heightened sense of concern for all parties before we actually start to feel like and function as one cohesive team, which is our ultimate goal.\nBeing on the agency side of the equation, this is something we see a lot. Over the years, our team has formed a process for how we like to do things \u2013 not just because we are comfortable with the way we do things but because we have seen effective results with our methods and tools. Yet, understandably, our customers feel the same way about their processes and tools and usually request we work within their systems. It\u2019s their project and information to retain, so that request makes sense. The challenge on our side is not only learning the requirements for their project, but also learning how to use a system, or several, that we may not be as familiar with. While we historically are not opposed to this, there are times when we will lobby a little harder for doing things the way we are accustomed to, particularly when there is a tight deadline and we must move fast to start delivering as soon as possible.\nWe recently ran into a situation just like the above. Thankfully, our client found\u00A0Unito, a tool specializing in two-way integrations, allowing our team to use our project management system,\u00A0Jira, and the client to use theirs,\u00A0Trello. While the same company owns these two project management products, they are very different. Here are some things Unito let us do to get the two applications talking to each other:\nThe client Trello board was used for tracking many different aspects of the project, not just our development effort. In order to not have to delete stories that did not involve our team, we created a rule so only cards were created in our Jira backlog if they were labeled \u201CBizStream.\u201D\nKeeping all stakeholders aware of the latest work was key, so we opted to map fields and use a two-way sync to ensure the items in both systems shared due dates, assignees, comments, descriptions, summaries, attachments, and links to the respective card in the other system.\nWe were able to map the Jira card status in its respective column to the Trello list status. Taking advantage of the existing automation we use in Jira, a simple movement of a card from our Development Team to our QA team, would automatically move the same card in both systems to the correct columns, and assign the person who is supposed to take ownership of that story next.\nWhat we loved most about this was the avoidance of duplicated efforts for both teams. A story written in one system appears in the correct spot in the other system, with the exact same information. It also gave each team the ability to work the way they were accustomed to, yet we are all viewing the same items, just a little differently. At the end of the project, both teams have a record of what was done, when it was done, and by whom.\nIt wasn\u2019t seamless, and there was a bit of a learning curve to start, but we managed to modify it as we went along, refining it to the point that it saved both teams a ton of time. Instead of making manual updates and needing more meetings to provide status updates, we could focus on continuing to move forward with the build. Another bonus is that as we made revisions and found better ways of doing things, there is an option to apply those changes to all current and previous cards in the project, or just the ones created from that point on. It\u2019s a nice touch. At the end of the day, Unito is helping us to keep our team happy and our clients happy, and we\u2019re actively attempting to utilize it with additional client projects as well.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Users will have six months beyond that date to access historical data before Google\u2019s new analytics product, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), becomes the new standard and all the data in Universal Analytics (UA) is erased.\nThis is a HUGE change, and it means that GA4 will fully replace UA as of July 1, 2023. The good news is that you\u2019ve got some time to start implementing GA4 on your site(s) and get used to the updated analytics.\nUA is in need of a refresh. The underlying system has become slow and clunky, not to mention that it no longer reflects how we use digital technology today.\nThe current version of UA has been around since October 2012. That\u2019s 10 years without a major update. In software terms, that is an eternity. Not only is UA technologically anchored to websites in an increasingly omnichannel world, but it has also fallen out of step with modern laws and expectations around privacy and the handling of personal data.\nWe\u2019ve seen rulings out of the EU that infer the use of UA can be a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because it sends its analytical data to the US, including details about IP addresses. A new way of processing the data needed to be implemented. GA4 offers greater control over privacy, with limits on how long data is stored, and anonymizing IP information. Along with those privacy issues, UA is built around third-party cookies for tracking attribution. With Apple\u2019s Safari already blocking third-party cookies and Chrome looking to remove them at the end of 2023 the old way needed to go.\nOne of the key differences between UA and GA4 is in how the data is structured. In UA you have Users, Sessions, Pages, Events, and Products. In GA4, it\u2019s gotten much simpler. There are only Users and Events. For example, in GA4, instead of having different tracking formats for a Page view vs an Event vs a Transaction, everything is an Event. This unfortunately means you can\u2019t just copy and paste what you have in UA over to GA4.\nIn GA4 Users also take center stage over Sessions. Metrics that used to be measured \u2018per session\u2019 are now more commonly based on \u201Cthe user\u201D. For example, conversions per user, event count per user, etc. GA4 puts a focus on the full customer journey, Google wants to highlight that a customer may interact with your brand across multiple sessions before converting. Previously, focusing on just a session conversion rate missed the entire journey which needs to be understood.\nThe bounce rate has changed in a good way, it\u2019s gone. Instead, GA4 focuses on Engaged Users. An Engaged User maybe someone who stays on the page for 10 seconds or longer, views more than one page, or triggers a conversion. This is great news for content-based websites (including our own BizStream website), as bounce rates can be a misleading indicator.\nViews (in admin) are gone. They\u2019ve been replaced with Account, Properties, and Data Streams, where a website might be one data stream and an app another. For example, you can no longer make a View out of people visiting your US website and another View of people visiting your German site. You can still get this data, you just need to filter within the reports.\nAnother huge change is that data is now only stored for 14 months. What? Analytics are only stored for a little more than a year? Yes, it\u2019s true. If you want to store the data longer, you would need to connect it to\u00A0BigQuery\u00A0(for a fee). This means you should probably consider how much data you actually need, or want, to back up, and how you want to look at your data historically.\nGA4 \u2013 which has been around since 2019 (initially called app \u002B web) \u2013 provides a much faster user interface, with deeper insights and features allowing you to drill down and take a more detailed look at the full customer journey.\nIf you\u2019ve looked under the hood at GA4\u2019s new interface and decided, \u201CNo, thank you,\u201D you\u2019re not alone. I felt that way when first starting to use GA4. The interface and terminology are different from the version you\u2019ve known for some time. Finding what you need may feel complicated. Rest assured, much of your hard-earned knowledge and skills do carry over.\nThings look different, but the basics of the analysis remain the same.\nIf you\u2019re setting up a brand new property,\u00A0create an account and set up a GA4 property.\nIf you already have a UA property, you can\u00A0add a GA4 property to your existing setup. When you click GA4 Setup Assistant, you create a Google Analytics 4 property that collects data alongside your existing Universal Analytics property. Your Universal Analytics property is left unchanged and continues to collect data\u2014you can always access it via the property selector or Admin screen.\nIf the above isn\u2019t your cup of tea,\u00A0reach out to us\u00A0and we\u2019ll help get your site up and running with the GA4 so you don\u2019t have to worry about it.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"351","pageTitle":"BYPWACAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/boost-your-productivity-with-a-custom-application-switcher-2/","text":"Boost Your Productivity With a Custom Application Switcher\nIf you are anything like me, you likely have ten or more programs or applications that are constantly running on your computer. Whether you are working or just using your computer for fun, it can be difficult to juggle multiple tasks while also staying productive. So what is the solution? How can you focus and manage your time more efficiently? To start, try to pinpoint the repetitive tasks you perform every day. Even if these tasks only take a few seconds at a time, they still add up and can hurt the flow of your daily processes. In general, I try to automate the tasks that can be automated and then find ways to make the remaining tasks more efficient, like using helpful keyboard shortcuts. Some repetitive tasks are inevitable, but we can still find ways to speed them up to the point where we don\u2019t even realize we are doing them. My favorite way of doing this is by using a custom application switcher that is easy to build, even easier to use, and completely free.\nSo what is a \u201Ccustom\u201D application switcher anyway? And what do I need to build and use it? In the simplest terms, an application switcher is exactly what it sounds like. It quickly switches the program or application that is currently in focus on your computer. This can be useful when you are constantly hopping back and forth between different applications and need a more streamlined way of doing so.\nTo build the application switcher, you will need a Windows computer, AutoHotkey, and your favorite text or code editor. AutoHotkey (also known as AHK) is a free, open-source Windows program for creating scripts. These scripts can be as simple or complex as you wish and can perform any number of tasks on your computer, including macros, auto-clicking, filling out forms, and more. For our purposes today, we will be using it to remap keyboard keys to open and switch to specific applications.\nTo get started, download and install AutoHotkey. There isn\u2019t much to the program itself. If you open it after installation, you will see that it is essentially a window that is filled with tutorials and documentation. Reading the documentation within the application or on the AutoHotkey site can be a great way to familiarize yourself with the program and figure out how to use it to write custom scripts. Once you feel comfortable with the general syntax of the scripting language and the functionality of the program, it is time to create our first script file.\nOpen up your favorite text or code editor. I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code because it is free and has a bunch of useful extensions that can greatly improve your experience with writing code (and scripts). My favorite VS Code extension made for AutoHotkey is AutoHotkey Plus which adds AHK language support, syntax highlighting, and debugging functionality.\nCreate a new script file and name it whatever you want; just make sure it has the \u201C.ahk\u201D file extension. For this tutorial, I named mine \u201CSwitcher.ahk\u201D. If you want your application switcher to automatically run each time you start your computer, place the script file inside the \u201CStartup\u201D folder. To get to the folder, press and hold the Windows key and then press the \u201CR\u201D key to open up the \u201CRun\u201D application. In the input next to the word \u201COpen\u201D, type \u201Cshell:startup\u201D and click OK. The \u201CStartup\u201D folder will open up in a Windows Explorer window where you can place your file.\nWhen creating our AHK script, it is important to remember that each script within the script file is generally made up of two components: the key(s) to press in order to perform an action, and then the action itself. The key portion of the script can be a single key or a key combination. AutoHotkey uses the following characters to denote the modifier keys on a keyboard:\nUsing the above symbols, if we wanted to create a shortcut by pressing Alt \u002B Windows \u002B X, the beginning of the script would look like \u201C!#x::\u201D without the quotes.Each key or key combination is followed by two colons which are then followed by the action or actions to take. It is completely up to you to decide which keys or key combinations to use in order to switch to your favorite applications. My personal favorite is using the keypad on the right side of a full-size keyboard. If you don\u2019t have a keypad, another option is to use the F1 through F12 keys (however many you wish to use). If neither of those options work for you, try using Windows \u002B Alt \u002B the first letter that your application starts with. Unsure of which to use? Set up a couple of different shortcut methods and see which one feels the most natural to you!\nIn my application switcher, each shortcut does the following:\nIn order to target specific applications, I use the Window Spy application that comes installed with AutoHotkey. Open it up and then open your application. With your application in focus, Window Spy will tell you information about your application that can be used to target it within a script. The most reliable way to target an application is by using the \u201Cahk_exe\u201D or the \u201Cahk_class\u201D property.\nLet\u2019s get to writing. With your script file open in your text or code editor, we can start laying out the overall structure of the script. I like to add a comment above each individual script in the file to help me quickly find the application name and what keyboard shortcut it is using. You can add comments to AHK scripts by typing a semicolon followed by the comment. If you are having a hard time deciding on applications to use in your script, try to think of which ones you use the most. I personally use Chrome, Slack, and Spotify frequently while I am working, so those are the ones I started with.\nUsing the Window Spy application, open your first application and find the value next to \u201Cahk_exe\u201D or \u201Cahk_class\u201D that you plan on using. Remember that this value needs to be unique for each application; otherwise you may run into issues. Some applications share the same \u201Cahk_class\u201D (like Chrome and Slack), so it is best to use \u201Cahk_exe\u201D in those cases.\nUnder your first comment in the script file, enter the keyboard shortcut you wish to use. To keep this tutorial simple, I will be using the function keys (F1, F2, etc.). In my case, the line will be \u201CF1::\u201D without the quotes.\nBelow the shortcut, we will use the WinExist function. This function checks if the specified application is running, and if it is, it will perform an action. There is also a negated version that performs an action if the application is not running: !WinExist. In our case, we will use the negated version to run the application if it\u2019s not currently running. For this example, I am using Slack as the application.\nThe updated script will look something like this:\nNotice the Run function being used to launch the application. Some applications will require you to point to the direct path of the executable, while others (like Chrome) will allow you to simply put the name of the file (chrome.exe). If you are having trouble launching your application, follow these steps:\nThe next part of the script will check if the window does exist using the WinExist function. If it does exist, we want to activate the application by bringing it into focus. The activation piece of the script is done with the WinActivate command, which can be used in conjunction with the WinExist command to automatically activate the application if it exists.\nThe updated script will look something like this:\nThis next part is optional, but I find it to be extremely helpful for certain applications. If the application exists and is in focus, we can then perform a specific action in the application when our keyboard shortcut is pressed again. I use this \u201Cspecial action\u201D to cycle through unread messages in Slack, play/pause music in Spotify, and cycle through my tabs in Chrome. The possibilities are pretty much endless, so I encourage you to get creative with your applications and workflows. Let\u2019s see how this extra function can be set up!\nIn the next line of our script, we are going to utilize the WinActive command. This command checks to see if our application is currently in focus and active. If the application is active, we can perform our specific action. In most cases, this specific action will end up being another keyboard shortcut, but you can perform additional actions as well as long as it is something that AutoHotkey supports. For this example, I am going to be using the keyboard shortcut Alt \u002B Shift \u002B Up (up arrow) in Slack, which navigates to the next unread conversation. In order to perform this keyboard shortcut, I am using the Send command.\nThe updated script will look something like this:\nAt the end of the above example, I have added the word \u201CReturn\u201D which lets AutoHotkey know that it should stop executing the script at that point. Every application script that we add to our script file will need to end with \u201CReturn\u201D in order for it to function correctly.\nNow that we have a fully functional script for a single application, it is time to expand our script to handle other applications as well. I have given you most of the tools to do this on your own, but I will give you one more full example that has a slightly different approach.\nIn the above example, there are some key differences from the first script. Instead of using three different \u201CIf\u201D statements, it only uses two and then utilizes an \u201CElse\u201D statement at the end to activate the application instead. The order of the script is slightly different than the first example, but they both accomplish the same end goal. If you are looking for a script for switching to Chrome and then cycling through your open tabs (by sending Ctrl \u002B Tab), this is a great one to use.\nAfter completing the scripts for your first one or two applications, let\u2019s officially test the application switcher. Save your file and then double-click on it in Windows Explorer to run it. With the script running, try pressing the keyboard shortcuts associated with your applications. If successful, you should be able to launch and switch between your applications with ease.\nLet\u2019s walk through my examples above with Slack and Chrome to really understand the workflow. I am working at my computer, and Slack and Chrome aren\u2019t running yet. If I press F1, Slack will open. If I press F2, Chrome will open. If I press F1 again, Slack will become active and in focus. Finally, if I press F1 a third time, it will send the keyboard shortcut to the application to jump to my next unread conversation. If I keep pressing F1, it will keep going to the next unread conversation until there are no more new messages to read. After catching up with my messages, I can press F2 again to switch to Chrome and continue on with my work. Pretty cool, huh?\nThanks for taking the time to read about my custom application switcher using AutoHotkey. Hopefully, I have inspired you to create one on your own to help boost your productivity and streamline your workflows. I recommend starting with a basic version that handles a couple of different applications to start and then adding more as you get more comfortable with using it. Play around with different keyboard shortcuts and \u201Cspecial actions\u201D to really give it a custom feel. Happy scripting!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"353","pageTitle":"Building Your Brand Online","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/building-your-brand-online/","text":"Building Your Brand Online\nEstablishing a strong and consistent online brand is essential to establishing your business as knowledgeable, trustworthy, and reliable. Plus, it\u2019ll make you look good too.\nYou can\u2019t build your brand online if you don\u2019t know what it is. At a base level, determining who you are as a company and what you stand for becomes the foundation for establishing the rest of your brand. Every company is different, does different things, and has different goals. So what your brand ends up looking like, sounding like, and feeling like should be unique to your specific company. For best results, work with a branding agency to help you through the branding process. (We specialize in developing brands, and we\u2019d love to help you out.)\nOnce the parts and pieces of your brand have been defined and created (logo, graphic elements, colors, typography, tone of voice, photography style, etc.), you\u2019ll have the assets you need to start building your brand online. These assets are usually collected, organized, and defined in a brand guide.\nLet\u2019s take a look at how Google, Spotify, Atlassian, and Netflix convey their brand standards.\nThe colors and typography used on your website and online branded content affect how people experience your brand, so it\u2019s essential to use them regularly and consistently. Your brand colors and typography are two of the most important elements of your brand because when used well, they create a visual throughline across all of your branded content.\nYour brand should have a range of colors and font styles to choose from. But don\u2019t go overboard with the color and font combinations. Instead, create a handful of effective combinations that can be used in a variety of situations. This will give you brand consistency without sacrificing brand personality.\nAnother key element of a successful brand is creating and using brand expression. Brand expression is the particular way your brand is conveyed (or expressed) across various media. Any set of brand assets (logo, colors, fonts, graphic elements, patterns, imagery, etc.) can be combined in millions of ways. However, throughout your brand development process and during the creation of the first few marketing materials, you\u2019ll start to discover specific combinations of brand assets that are most effective in communicating your message and your brand. These specific combinations of assets are collectively known as your brand expression. For example, one particular combination of a large headline and brand pattern might be best for blog posts. Another combination of subtle headlines, photos, and icons might be better for anniversary announcements. There\u2019s no limit to the way your brand can be expressed, as long as the executions as a whole feel like they\u2019re all part of the same brand.\nYour brand is more than just the visuals you use in your marketing materials. It is also the way your brand \u201Ctalks.\u201D This is known as your brand voice. Your brand voice is the way you talk to your customers through written headlines, body copy, and other branded communications. Your brand voice can have any style you want, as long as it feels true to your core values and brand personality. It can be playful, serious, ominous, quirky, or fun. A well-executed brand voice adds another layer of interaction that helps make a brand more memorable in the minds of your customers.\nYour online presence is much more than just your website. Customers interact with your brand online in many other ways. These other interactions should be just as consistent with your brand as anything else you create. Customers may interact via social networks, customer support, chatbots, job postings, and so on. Each customer touchpoint has its own limitations for how you can express your brand (logo size/placement, branded images (or not), amount of text, etc.). So, play to each service\u2019s strength. If it\u2019s a social network, include more branded images, well-written copy, and quality links. If it\u2019s a chatbot or job posting, make sure the copy is in the right tone of voice for your brand. Never miss an opportunity to build your brand in the eyes of the customer, no matter how large or small the interaction may be.\nIn our interconnected digital world, customers interact with your brand in a variety of ways. The best way to stand out from the noise and stick in the minds of your customers is with consistent and engaging branding. Whether it\u2019s a glimpse of a social post they see as they swipe through their feed, the wording of a reply email, or the visual impact of your home page as they click through from an internet search. The better you express your brand at every level, the greater your chances of increasing your brand awareness and growing your customer base.\nWe love developing brands and helping them make an impact online.

{"id":"354","pageTitle":"HWHPD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-we-handle-project-deployments/","text":"How We Handle Project Deployments\nAt BizStream, we follow a development lifecycle (also called DevOps) that\u2019s built to increase efficiency, provide continuous delivery, and improve software quality. Software deployments are only a small part of this overall lifecycle, but they\u2019re the main focus of this blog post. First, I\u2019ll briefly cover our development process from a high level so you can see where deployments fit into the big picture, and then we\u2019ll dig into the technical details of deployments.\nI\u2019ll first lay out our development process from a very high level, starting with sprint planning using Agile and then ending with our deployment process.\nFirst, I\u2019ll start by discussing a development step that helps reduce the pain of deploying database changes. Database changes need to happen in a particular order, and it\u2019s easy to make mistakes if the steps aren\u2019t tested and performed carefully. The best way to handle database changes is with automation such as Entity Framework (EF) or Xperience by Kentico.\nVersion Control systems are essential to all automated deployment processes. They record all software changes made by developers and help us determine what code goes where and at what times by utilizing a branching strategy. At BizStream, we use the Git Flow branching strategy. Put simply, it\u2019s a process that determines how finished code moves through the system before it gets merged into its final destination, the main code branch that is deployed to production servers at the end of an Agile sprint.\u00A0Gitflow can be used for projects that have scheduled release cycles, like most projects at BizStream, and for the DevOps best practice of continuous delivery. Gitflow assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact (atlassian.com).Here are the specific branches we use at BizStream and their roles:\nIn the past, we used a manual \u201Ccopy and paste\u201D process to perform deployments. We built the code on our local machine and copied the compiled code and web files over to the live server as fast as we could. Of course, we ran into issues, some changes were forgotten, deployments took up a lot of our time, and they were stressful. We don\u2019t like taking our client\u2019s sites down for extended periods of time either. So, we decided to automate these manual deployment steps using Azure DevOps and Octopus.\nThe first thing we wanted to automate was our build process. An automated build compiles the code files into DLLs. It then compresses those DLLs, along with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, into a deployment package (kind of like a zip folder of code and web files that can be easily transferred to a server). To automate this process, we typically set up several different build triggers that kick off the compilation and bundling of our code.\nBuild triggers are a signal to Azure DevOps to build the code in a specific repository branch. These are the same branches we discussed above in this article. At BizStream, we typically utilize the following branch build triggers:\nSo, what actually happens when a build is triggered? Here\u2019s a list of our most used automated build steps:\nThe second thing we automated was our release process. We don\u2019t want to pass around server credentials between each other, have developers logging into production sites late at night, or manually copying over files and database changes by hand anymore.\nAfter the deployment package is created and sent to the staging directory by the automated build process, we utilize Azure DevOps or Octopus to automatically copy over the packaged code to specific servers. Below is a list of the most used steps in our automated release processes:\nThere isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all deployment solution that works for every team or project, but the deployment process outlined above usually works very well for us and our clients. If you\u2019d like more information about the best DevOps and Continuous Integration practices, I highly recommend taking a look at the book Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"355","pageTitle":"SUSAACWTAA","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/simplifying-user-stories-and-acceptance-criteria-with-templates-and-automation/","text":"Simplifying User Stories and Acceptance Criteria With Templates and Automation\nCall it what you will; a personal philosophy, a theory, idiotic, but I have long held the belief that every personality trait is a double-edged sword. Patience is a wonderful attribute but, taken too far, can turn to apathy. Dedication to an ideal or a goal is very admirable, but not when it is to the exclusion of all else. Finding balance in life is one of the most difficult and impactful things we can do.\nFor me, I struggle to find the line between finding the best way to accomplish a given task and actually getting the damn thing done. It\u2019s easy to spend so much time improving a process or an approach that, when it comes to actually putting it into action, you have to rush it and disregard half your work to make a deadline. That\u2019s why, as often as I can, I try to remove the necessity to rethink things on a continual basis. That doesn\u2019t mean continuous improvement isn\u2019t still a goal, just that I\u2019m going to check-in and improve on things every so often rather than changing things in the middle of a task. This provides consistency and a big benefit to efficiency because now we can template and automate things since they aren\u2019t changing every single time we use them.\nHaving a template for each card/ticket we create accomplishes a couple of things. First, it ensures that I don\u2019t forget to include something I need to. Second, it is one less thought process I have to put energy into when dealing with already-complex issues.\nThe late Steve Jobs famously wore the same outfit every day. Many other notable figures such as Mark Zuckerberg, Albert Einstein, and President Obama did something similar. The reason? Decision fatigue. The idea is that your brain really only has the capacity to make so many decisions in a day. The more menial the decision, the less of that budget it uses up, but it still uses some of it. By eliminating a decision, we give ourselves a little back in terms of brain budget for the day. That\u2019s the goal here.\nSo without further ado, here is my mildly-interesting-but-hopefully-useful template for capturing user stories, acceptance criteria, and all the other information needed for a feature.\nI like\u00A0Atlassian\u2019s definition of what a user story\u00A0is. \u201CA user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.\u201D\u00A0User stories are meant to answer the question \u201Cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201D. It\u2019s the lens through which all the other information should be viewed.\nWe used to have designs documented in a single spot and just put something like \u201CSee article detail design\u201D on a card. We\u2019ve found it\u2019s much more helpful to link to a specific design or a specific part of a design wherever possible. Especially as front-end frameworks and new ways of thinking about content management drive us to be ever more modular and component/widget-based. I also find it very helpful to include a quick screenshot of the feature since, often, designs do not break things down component by component but have them in context.\nRarely does anything ever get finalized in a single sitting. Usually, there are initial requirements, design reviews, questions/clarifications from the design review, re-evaluation of requirements, technical considerations, and so on and so forth that all need to get hammered out before we\u2019re ready to put a feature into a sprint. This section helps me keep track of where we\u2019re at with a given feature, so I don\u2019t have to remember what we still need to figure out.\nAssumptions are a common thing in agile development. Here we\u2019re listing things like\nAnything that we\u2019re basing our acceptance criteria off of that would otherwise affect the content entry or user experience of a feature is listed here.\nThis is one of the most important sections. Acceptance criteria are the details that provide a checklist for developers and QA alike. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean this needs to be loaded with complexity. Sometimes it\u2019s as simple as listing the parts of the feature that are editable by the editor and which are static. Often we will list things here that are not obvious when looking at the designs, such as what API the data is coming from or what happens when I click that button over there.\nAutomated UI testing is becoming more and more integrated into everything we build. If you\u2019ve ever run into a situation where you get a customer complaint that a form isn\u2019t working and, after investigating, you discover it was a regression problem that only appeared on production from a deployment you did a week ago, you\u2019ll understand why. Websites are large and complicated. It\u2019s impractical to expect humans to check every single page, section, feature, etc., every time a change is made. Automated testing allows us to let the system do the work for us on the most important sections of the site to make sure those forms still work and that the 3rd party API we\u2019re using to bring in job results didn\u2019t change without warning and break things.\nThe reality is that there can often be months between first writing all the details for a feature and actually implementing it. I can barely remember what I was working on two hours ago let alone how we decided we were going to build a feature on one of our five projects six months ago. This is the spot where we list notes to ourselves about how we planned to solve a particular problem or what architecture we\u2019re going for so that future-us doesn\u2019t have to swear more than necessary.\nOkay, so this is not going to be an in-depth dive into automation. Instead, I just want to share with you what I use. Rather than have to use any brainpower to remember where I\u2019ve written my template so I can copy and paste it into the card/ticket I\u2019m writing, I just wrote an AutoHotkey script to do it for me. If you\u2019re not familiar with AutoHotkey, it is a scripting language that can do pretty much anything you can do on your computer. Open programs, automatically copy text from anywhere and search Google for it, etc. For a complete guide on how to get started with AutoHotkey you can\u00A0check out their docs here.\nIn this case we\u2019re really just using it for a text macro with some added flair. You\u2019ll notice a bunch of \u201Cextra\u201D characters in the below script. We use Jira as our project management software so I\u2019ve put Jira-flavored Markdown into it to pre-format a bunch of stuff. The Markdown Jira uses is relatively standard but, depending on the system you use, YMMV (your mileage may vary for the non-l33t 5p34k125).\nBasically, all you have to do is type \u201C]us\u201D and hit \u201Cspace\u201D or \u201Center\u201D and you\u2019ll wind up with exactly what you saw in the template above. Hopefully, some of you find this useful and take it and make it your own. Set your own shortcut and update it to reflect your system and needs.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

If you\u2019re a developer at this point in time, you know how crazy the job market has been recently. After the economic shock COVID-19 brought in March 2020, the developer market has gotten absolutely crazy. Money\u2019s cheap due to low-interest rates, so companies are willing to pay through the nose to get talented developers working for them, causing developers to jump ship left and right trying to pick up sign-on bonuses and marginally higher salaries.\nAt BizStream, we know this isn\u2019t sustainable and are doing everything we can (within reason) to try and stay as competitive as possible without overextending ourselves.

{"id":"358","pageTitle":"MTFCDTSD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/my-transition-from-childhood-development-to-software-development/","text":"My Transition From Childhood Development to Software Development\nLess than a year ago, I couldn\u2019t tell you what a for loop was. I worked with children with cognitive delays and autism in a residential care facility. I also spent several of those years doing ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) in a clinical setting, which will be important to note later in this post.\nIn September 2016, I attended the Michigan Autism Conference in Kalamazoo, MI. Toward the end of the keynote speakers\u2019 speech, they asked,\u00A0\u201CDo we have any software developers here? We are in serious need of more ABA software.\u201D\u00A0For the rest of the conference and the weekend following it, I kept thinking,\u00A0\u201CWhat else could they possibly need for software?\u201D\u00A0That following Monday, I went back to work. We all had iPads that had one of the most widely used ABA data tracking applications (at the time). As I went through the workday, I kept catching myself wondering why the app would behave a certain way. Why did I have to type in the values in some spots, use a slider in other spots, and \u201Cjust know\u201D what a button did in another spot? As it turns out, this was not so much about the quality of the code written for the app, as it was about the tools the administrators were given and the lack of support they received after their initial purchase of the app.\nAfter finishing out my day of clinical therapy with the children, I would open another portal on a computer where I would open two separate forms to input all of the data I entered into the iPad. The Behavior Analyst would then use the data for their reports. This was when the cartoon lightbulb turned on above my head; I didn\u2019t know a thing about software development, but I knew there had to be a way to streamline this process. Every time I went through the tedious task of re-entering data, my curiosity grew \u2013 until I began doing the logical thing \u2013 looking at Computer Science degrees from universities. Mind you, I didn\u2019t even know what code was, but I figured it had to be pretty much the same as changing the background of my MySpace profile to lime green and embedding obnoxious ska songs that you couldn\u2019t turn off \u2013 I was good at that. But, believe it or not, working in the non-profit social work field does not lend you much time or money. So I decided a CS degree would not be in the cards in the near future, but something I could think about for later. After all, I genuinely loved what I was doing, and I was good at it \u2013 why would I think about switching careers?\nFast-forward 3 years to the fall of 2018 \u2013 I had just started a role at working with stained glass; building, designing, and restoring windows and fixtures. It turned out that the mental health field sucks a lot of energy out of you, and I needed to change it up for a bit. I had completely forgotten about my interest in software until a friend of mine invited me to attend a free \u201CIntro To Coding\u201D class with them at the\u00A0Grand Circus\u00A0campus in Grand Rapids. I immediately took up the offer. Once there, we worked on simple things in JavaScript; variables, \u201CHello world\u201D, etc. This is where I started understanding how vast the computer world really is. It was a bit overwhelming, but that just made me all the more intrigued. I immediately started looking into the bootcamps but wasn\u2019t sure if I trusted the promises they made \u2026 that was a lot of money to throw at a three-month course. I put it on the backburner again. I needed some more evidence that this is something people see success in.\nAround mid-summer of 2019, I realized that custom glasswork was just not something I wanted to keep pursuing; I was tired of going home with my hands cut up every day- among other safety risks. I missed my job with the kids and decided to come back full-time from my on-call status. It was great. I knew how to do everything, and I had a great report with the other staff and clients almost immediately.\u00A0The warm and fuzzy feeling took a sharp nosedive as soon as the pandemic shut down started. When you are in an environment with a bunch of children that don\u2019t like changing routines, stopping the spread of a virus is nearly impossible. The stress of being actively exposed constantly on top of the usual stress was all I needed to push me to make a change. There are so many remote jobs available, and I know I loved the tiny amount of coding I had learned. Let\u2019s do it.\u00A0\u00A0It\u2019s late December, and I have a workbook to finish to be fully accepted into the bootcamp. Looking back, I cannot believe the amount of stress a for loop put on me. I spent hours on a problem that would take me less than 10 seconds now. At the moment, it seemed so difficult, but being able to view and measure my progress has remained one of the biggest motivators to keep going with it. A week into the class came the \u201COh, this will always be a challenge\u201D feeling, which is actually quite comforting in a strange way. From what I have gathered from everyone else in the industry, there will always be more to learn. The great thing about the industry, and BizStream in particular, is that it fosters growth and knowledge. Rather than throwing you to the wolves, so to speak, you are given a chance to ask questions without ridicule, explore further education opportunities and commiserate with other devs when neither the official documentation nor Google have the answers you\u2019re seeking.\nThe interview process at BizStream after doing a bootcamp was incredibly intimidating, considering I was competing with people that had completed four-year CS degrees. Still, I felt confident enough to admit when I did not know how to answer something. After all, I am still learning. BizStream seemed to lean into this and made it apparent that they would be willing to continue that process with me. As someone coming from a background in social work and case management, they assured me that my hands-on knowledge in the field was invaluable. They were quick to offer me a hybrid position as a junior developer and support desk specialist.\nThe two roles work really well together; I am asked questions that involve some searching \u2013 helping me understand the code better while also learning how to answer those questions more quickly from understanding the code. My previous experience in the social work field helps me know customers\u2019 needs and their urgency. Knowing how confusing many of the local, state, and federal processes are with youth case management has also aided in communication with clients. BizStream genuinely values my input on subjects about social work and youth-related subjects, which keeps me motivated to improve continuously. My opportunities at BizStream will continue to open if the team keeps rowing in the same direction. Dropping everything to switch careers might sound terrifying (it is), but if you are willing to fully commit to networking and practicing (and more practicing), you can accomplish it. There are many people in the tech community that would love to help you succeed.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"359","pageTitle":"IACAV","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/integrating-asp-net-core-and-vue-js/","text":"Integrating ASP.NET Core and Vue.js\nIt\u2019s hard enough trying to choose frameworks for your tech stack. It sometimes becomes frustrating when you find out they don\u2019t integrate very easily. Recently I\u2019ve had the opportunity to integrate ASP.NET Core and Vue.js so I thought I\u2019d share my knowledge with you!\nFirst, let\u2019s create a Blank Solution. Within this solution, we will be creating two projects. Creating two separate projects allows a better separation of concerns between back-end and front-end code.\nNext, we will add an ASP.NET Core Web Application project and use the Web Application (Model-View-Controller) template.\nFinally, we create a Blank Node.js Web Application project.\nOur solution tree should look something like this:\nMake sure to go to the properties of your solution and set the startup project to single and select the MVC project.\nLet\u2019s install the packages we will need. Instead of installing packages manually through the command line, we will instead populate the package.json in our Node.js project and install all the packages in one go. Simply copy and paste the following code block, replacing the default code. Then run a clean install of the packages.\nIn our Index view of the Home feature, we can add a custom element.\nThis is where our matching Vue component will mount.\u00A0\u00A0Then in the layout, we can add some stylesheets and scripts that will be generated later by Webpack. In the head of our layout we will add these link tags:\nAnd at the end of our body will add these script tags:\nThat\u2019s it for our MVC project! We\u2019ve given our Vue application a home to live. Now we have to move in.\nLet\u2019s create a file, webpack.config.js, and a folder named src. Then, rename server.js to index.js and move it into the src folder. Within the src folder, create two more folders: components and styles. Finally, in the styles folder create style.scss.Our Node.js Project should look something like this:\nCreate a file named HelloWorld.vue in our components folder and insert the following code:\nHello, world!\nIn the same folder, create a JavaScript file named component-loader. First, let\u2019s import Vue and our HelloWorld component.\nSecond, let\u2019s create an array of objects that contains our component and its corresponding custom element name.\nWhen you add more Vue components, all you will need to do is import the component and add another object with its reference and custom element name to the components array. I suggest translating from pascal-case to kebab-case as per Vue\u2019s style guide, but ultimately the choice is up to you.For example,\nFinally, let\u2019s create and export the function that will render our Vue components.\nThis function will take the components array and check if each custom element is present on the current page\u2019s DOM. If it finds the element, it initializes and mounts the related Vue component. Once mounted, we\u2019re in Vue land!In index.js we want to import our component loader and call it.\nLast but not least, we want to configure Webpack. Let\u2019s add our constants. This includes plugin imports, paths, and babel configuration. For brevity, we\u2019ll skip how this all works and just go through the setup.\nNext, we insert our module.exports\nIf you have a different structure to your solution, you may need to tweak the path constants and entry points to suit your needs.\nWith that, we\u2019ve integrated MVC and Vue!Once within a Vue entry point, you have all the great parts of Vue such as single-file components and reactive data. Adding more component entry points is easy too.There is one caveat. Vue components have no elegant way to receive data from a Razor view. It is possible to send data through an API controller in the MVC project and make an AJAX call from your Vue components; however, we\u2019ll have to cover that in a future article so stay tuned!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"360","pageTitle":"PAIIOWC","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/positivity-and-its-impact-on-work-culture/","text":"Positivity and its Impact on Work Culture\nOn average, Americans worked\u00A034.4 hours per week in 2019. That translates to over 20% of the week we spend at work. Shouldn\u2019t spending that much time at work be a positive experience?\nAt BizStream, we live by our Core Values, which is the foundation of our culture:\nBe Positive is extremely important because it plays a role in all the values. But what does \u201CBe Positive\u201D mean at BizStream, exactly?\nIt\u2019s well known that there\u2019s a favorable correlation between positive employees and positive culture. So how can we create a positive culture, you say? I\u2019m glad you asked.\nThe first task should be to\u00A0understand the current culture\u00A0and evaluate what strengths and weaknesses exist. Strengths should be fortified, enhanced, and potentially celebrated. Identifying weaknesses will give focus to possible adjustments that can be made to achieve the desired culture. Getting input from the employees should also be paramount. Business leaders do not always have the same perspective on company culture as the employees.\nOne way for leadership to ensure a healthy environment is to build trust by communicating openly, honestly, and transparently when getting employee feedback about company culture. Make employees feel like they are a part of the company by emphasizing a team atmosphere.\u00A0Allow employees to provide input and listen to them. Allowing employees the opportunity to provide feedback on something as big as establishing or changing company culture can bring everyone together and provide them with purpose.\nSet expectations and goals\u00A0and\u00A0measure those goals frequently. Providing feedback is also critical to establishing cultural dos and don\u2019ts and affirming open lines of communication. It also brings into view the bullet point \u201Cassume the best intentions.\u201D We often think of feedback as a source of correction or pointing out needed improvement, but feedback can take many forms. Feedback can also be a recognition of going above and beyond. Recognizing individuals for their good deeds can be as crucial as identifying mistakes. Regular check-ins and one-on-one meetings without an agenda are great for generating trust and creating additional channels of communication for feedback in both directions between management and employees.\nThere are numerous events throughout the year at BizStream, including our annual golf outing, internal celebrations, a camping trip, March Madness parties, and company picnics, this year held at Michigan\u2019s Adventure. Each of these events brings everyone together in a fun and social capacity.\nWe also have the regular Lunch and Learn events where topics range from benefits to a discussion panel on Kentico CI.\nHaving events, such as team-building activities or social events, helps to create an inclusive environment. Provide short surveys to get employee feedback\u2014again, another option for communication that can potentially be anonymous if you have challenges with employees not speaking up honestly.\nOrganizations should invest in their employees\u2019 wellness because it will help build a positive environment and generate community. An employer who makes an employee feel like they matter helps give meaning to that employee\u2019s work. If possible, offer employees benefits that can positively impact them\u2014gym/yoga memberships, mental health resources, assistance programs, and other things that can help their general well-being.\nBizStream offers several benefits directly towards our well-being. Many BizStreamers workout together and challenge each other at CrossFit Allendale, as the membership is paid for by the company. If CrossFit isn\u2019t your thing, BizStream offers gym stipends. We have the opportunity to do a 23andMe DNA genetic test to find out health and family data. Generous PTO and flexible schedules also provide us with the time we need\u2014be it for vacation or if you just need to flex some time because you have a contractor coming to estimate your leaking roof.\nThe beneficial effects of having a positive culture are extensive:\nFurthermore, there is the potential for increased recruitment opportunities due to positive word of mouth, reviews, or feedback. A positive culture could net you some local, regional, or national awards to help further promote your brand and business, including recruitment. Conversely, if a poor culture is in place and employees leaving the company write bad reviews, this could impact recruitment.\nDon\u2019t just set up a vague outline of values the company should adopt, define each of those values further to provide ample understanding for all employees. Every company should seek its own set of values to match its principles and goals. This can guide the way for cultivating the type of atmosphere the company wants and the type of employees it wants to attract. And most importantly\u2014live those values from the top down. Asking employees to abide by a cultural framework that isn\u2019t respected by all is a quick way to allow good culture to deteriorate.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"361","pageTitle":"HTSUWAW.5","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-set-up-windows-authentication-with-net-5/","text":"How to Set up Windows Authentication With .NET 5\nWhen building an intranet-facing utility, making sure the correct people are the only ones getting access can be crucial. While there are many other ways to implement authentication, Windows Authentication is one of the easiest and has the advantage of using the existing security infrastructure of your Windows domain environment. A word of caution, though; Windows Authentication should only be used for an internal-facing application only. It will work over the internet, but that presents a large security headache you don\u2019t want.\nIn order to use Windows Authentication, there are a few things you need to have set up beforehand that are not covered in this post.\nThe first thing you need to do is create a new project in Visual Studio. The easiest way to accomplish this is in the command prompt, but first, we need to create a directory to store our files in.Open VSCode, and open the folder you want to use. For this example, I\u2019ll be using C:\\code\\windowsauth, but you can use anything you choose. You should get the terminal open at the bottom automatically to the folder you are in; if not, use the Terminal \u003E New Terminal command to open the command prompt.\nCreate a new project with the command:\nOnce your project is created, you\u2019ll have a ton of new files. The one we\u2019re most concerned with is Startup.cs, as this is where we are going to add most of the code to enable authentication.You\u2019ll want to build and run the application to ensure everything is working properly. You may need to close and reopen VSCode to get it to prompt you to add the build and debug files. Alternatively, you can use the dotnet command line commands to build and run, which are:\nOnce running, you\u2019ll want to open a web browser (if it didn\u2019t open automatically) and go to\u00A0https://localhost:5001, and you\u2019ll see this:\nNow that we have everything set up and verified working, it\u2019s time to start adding the authentication. First things first, we need to add a NuGet package. In the command prompt open in VSCode, use the following command to add the Microsoft package we need to make it all work:\nNext, we want to start adding the code to the Startup.cs file. Open up Startup.cs, and you should see a section labeled \u201CConfigureServices\u201D and it should be mostly blank right now. We need to tell our application to enable Authentication and Authorization, so you\u2019ll want to add them to the services collection. When you\u2019ve done that, it\u2019ll look like this:\nYou\u2019ll also need to add a using statement to the top to use the Negotiate functions and constants, so add this to the top of the file:\nThe last thing we need to add to enable authentication in the code is down in the Configure function. The default template we used adds the line \u201Capp.UseAuthorization()\u201D for us already, but we need to tell the app to use our authentication as well. Both the authentication line and authorization lines\u00A0MUST\u00A0be between the \u201Capp.UseRouting()\u201D line and the \u201Capp.UseEndpoints()\u201D line to work. When done, the function should look like this:\nNow that we have Authentication all set up, we need to use it in the application somewhere. To accomplish this, we\u2019re going to protect the entire Home Controller on the application because it\u2019ll give us a very easy and quick way to tell everything is working. Open up the HomeController.cs file, located in the Controllers folder. We\u2019re going to add a single line above the class declaration; here is what that will look like when done:\nNotice we used a group that doesn\u2019t exist. This is on purpose so we can see it denying us access first, and we\u2019ll know for sure it\u2019s working properly when we fix it. Run your application again; you should see an access denied page:\nNow stop the debugger and change that group name to one that exists, and your user is a member of. If you don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t sure, you can print out some of your user details by typing this command in the VS Code terminal window:\nThis will print out a lot of information about your user, but what we\u2019re looking for is a section labeled \u201CThe user is a part of the following security groups\u201D which is a list of every group you are a part of. Pick one of those and replace the \u201CSomeGroupThatDoesntExist\u201D with the one you picked. Now run the application again; you should now see the page instead of an error like you did before:\nThat\u2019s everything, you now have Windows Authentication running in your development environment! When securing your application, you can do so at the Controller level, which secures everything like my example, or you can do individual actions; the way you do it is exactly the same, just add the line with Authorize above the action and not the controller.\nThis will have gotten your environment working for local development. It should continue working properly as long as you use a localhost address to run everything. Let\u2019s go over what you need to do for deployment with a real URL and not a localhost one. Note that if you choose to use a real URL for a development environment (like mysitename.com.test or something similar), you\u2019ll have to follow the same directions here to make that work as well.\u00A0You\u2019ll need to set up and configure your web server that will be running the application. Once done, you\u2019ll want your administrator to run the following command in the command prompt or PowerShell:\nMake sure to replace intranet.company.com with the actual address your application will be using and YourServerNameGoesHere with the actual name of the server the application is being deployed to. Without going into the nitty-gritty of what this command actually does, it will authorize the server to access and use permissions from Active Directory, which is what we need.\u00A0You will also want to ensure you have a security certificate on your site, it\u2019s not required to make everything work, but it is very highly recommended when using authentication of any kind to maintain security.\nIf you are new to Authentication with .Net, you\u2019ll want to read more on what you can do. Microsoft is usually a pretty good resource on this so the best place to start would be\u00A0Microsoft\u2019s .Net Documentation on Authentication.\u00A0If you are interested in learning more about how the authorization side works and the different ways you can implement and use it, start with\u00A0Microsoft\u2019s .Net Documentation on Authorization.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"363","pageTitle":"KXBKEIS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/keeping-xperience-by-kentico-environments-in-sync/","text":"Keeping Xperience by Kentico Environments in Sync\nIn software development, we typically employ several environments to offer a separation of features that are currently being developed, tested, approved, and released.\nCommonly this involves a 4-tier approach having a development, test, stage, and production environment. The development stage is where all new features are introduced which often involves integrating existing content into that new feature set. One problem with this development cycle is having test content on the dev server that closely resembles content that will actually be used in a production environment. Without an accurate representation of the content, section titles may be too long, images too large or too small, menus too cluttered, and other visual inconsistencies that were not caught in the quality assurance step. For this reason, I recommend some type of periodic synchronization of content. With Xperience by Kentico, there are several approaches that can be used to accomplish this.\nHands down, this is the easiest approach. You select the pages you want to push, click the stage button, and magically your content appears on the target server. The hardest part of using content staging is configuring the servers to talk to each other.\nUsing the Export wizard, you can export all of the content of a production site into an archive file. This content package can then be uploaded to other environments and imported.\nFull database backups are a common way to synchronize environments. Using this method, you can ensure that all the content, well\u00A0everything, gets its way back down to dev. For example, you can create a data-tier export (bacpac) or create a backup (bak), transfer that to the development server, and restore.\nKentico continuous integration\u00A0was designed to serialize the data objects from the database into XML files on the file system so you can then add them to a\u00A0version control system\u00A0such as\u00A0git. Typically, this is used between team members to synchronize their databases during development. An advanced use for Kentico CI is syncing content from one environment to another. This can be done by serializing the content on production, copying the files back to development, and running the ContinuousIntegration.exe utility. This process can also be scripted by utilizing the\u00A0Kentico API.\nThere are several ways you can use to keep your environments in sync. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and it all depends on which approach will work best for you. For me, using Kentico CI is something I\u2019ve only recently considered using for environment syncs, and it looks very promising.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"364","pageTitle":"LIGWK","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/localization-in-gatsbyjs-with-kontent-ai/","text":"Localization in GatsbyJS with Kontent.ai\nLocalization is an effective tool to extend the reach of messages and content on a website to additional audiences outside of the primary language. In a typical application or site, localization is often considered a difficult or complex feature for developers to implement, but with a static site framework like GatsbyJS coupled with a headless CMS like Kontent.ai, localization can be easy to implement.\nThis article focuses on implementing localization within a GatsbyJS site using Kontent and will not be delving deeply into configuring localization in Kontent itself. The Kontent Docs provides documentation on setting up localization in the CMS under Set up your project languages.\nAnother assumption that will be made is the use of the gatsby-source-kontent package as the primary method of retrieving data from Kontent and populating the GraphQL queries used in a site. For the purposes of properly communicating language to the client viewing the site, the gatsby-plugin-react-helmet will be used to modify the page structure outside of the site content. The install process and configuration of these packages can be found on their respective pages on the Gatsby package listing.\nThis article will focus on a \u201Cpost\u201D content type, which aligns with articles and blog posts, but the same process can be applied to any content type.\nRetrieving localized content from Kontent increases the complexity of the static site, as each instance of content will be multiplied by the number of languages configured in Kontent. For example, a site with 50 articles and six languages will have 300 pieces of queried content. The content retrieved for a particular subsection of the site can be reduced by using variables on a normal GraphQL query to filter out content by language, but Gatsby\u2019s static queries do not support variables. As using static queries would require additional handling in JavaScript to filter out all content types, static queries will be avoided. As independent components won\u2019t be able to query for the data used in the component, the content types used for those components, such as navigation or metadata, should be queried for at the same time as other content. Using a \u201Cglobal\u201D content type that holds all global information typically retrieved using static queries can make modeling localizable content more manageable.\nTo reduce the amount of data available to any particular page and to manage these pages across languages, it is expected that all pages will be created using Gatsby\u2019s Node API (even the index page). The key important difference between a single language site and a multi-language site at this point is the inclusion of an additional GraphQL field provided by Kontent: preferred_language. The language field in the system corresponds to the actual language of the content instance, which will be the default or primary language if it hasn\u2019t been translated.\nThe query to retrieve articles for page creation might end up looking like the following:\nslug and preferred_language are important for the next step: creating the localized page. Gatsby\u2019s createPage function takes an object containing the page path, the template component, and any context data to pass into the page template. Configured using the query above, the createPages API in Gatsby might end up looking like the following:\nThis will create a page using the article.template.js file for each Article content item, assigning the page path based on the language and the slug, and provide the language variable into the page query associated with the template. After the filters are applied, the data forwarded to the template component will be no different from the data used on a single language site.\nIn order to communicate with the browser that the particular page is intended to be in a specific language, the lang attribute should be set on the page. One easy way of making the page metadata header available to page generation is through the use of the gatsby-plugin-react-helmet plugin. This is fairly simple to do and can be achieved by using the helmet component with the htmlAttributes prop.\nThe language code used by the lang attribute is described in RFC 5646: Tags of Identifying Languages. In the event that the language names do not align between Kontent and those considered valid for HTML, mapping those to valid language tags is left as an exercise for the reader. Instances of this may occur when the language code name is the full language name, such as English or Japanese, or when the default language is named default.\nOne benefit of using Kontent as a headless CMS for a multi-language Gatsby site is that Kontent allows the linking of content types, allowing one content type to contain link to many others, such as a navigation content type containing links, or a banner or featured items content type containing multiple call to action buttons. Intentional structuring of content types can enable reuse of translations across multiple components, such as through a \u201Clocalization string\u201D content type. In order to make use of these content trees, especially due to the increased overhead of static queries on a multi-language site, one effective approach is to pass the relevant context item from the page template to the components that implement a specific content type. The following will demonstrate how to do this for a hero or featured component with a call to action.\nThe action_label on the call to action is retrieved from the kontent_item_localization_string, which is an additional component that consists of just a text value that may be used in multiple locations, such as \u201CSubscribe\u201D or \u201CEnroll.\u201D A similar process can be used to query for a global component, which can be used to provide access to content types that are used on all pages, such as headers and footers.\nGraphQL can be organized into \u201Cfragments\u201D, which act as subsets of queries, in order to make writing page queries, especially when using many common content types, like the localization string content type as mentioned above. Gatsby has condensed the GraphQL documentation into an easy-to-access form, which can be read here.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"365","pageTitle":"HBEDOQS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-bizstream-ensures-delivery-of-quality-software/","text":"How BizStream Ensures Delivery of Quality Software\nAt BizStream, we\u2019ve come a long way in our effort to reduce bugs and repair them quickly when they happen. We have many processes in place to prevent bugs, such as our software development process, automated testing, QA personnel, and error logging software. In this blog post, I\u2019ll break down the many different ways we care about delivering quality software.\nThe most cost-efficient way to fix a bug is by preventing it in the first place. Typically, the least expensive bug to fix is the bug that is found during requirements gathering. Conversely, the most expensive bug to fix is found on a live production site. In this section, I\u2019ll walk through the many ways we prevent bugs from occurring.\nThe best way to prevent bugs is by following a proven software development process like Agile Scrum. At BizStream, we follow the Agile Scrum steps on every project. These steps include:\nAllows developers to step through code, line by line, to see how it runs. Values can be changed in real-time to simulate possible issues and test out different scenarios.\nDevelopers can add many extensions to help them out, like spell checkers and code completion tools.\nResharper suggests code refactorings that are more performant and less error-prone.\nAfter a developer is assigned a task, they will begin the work on their local computer with an exact copy of the live site you\u2019ll see in your own browser. This gives them the chance to make changes without affecting the production site. We can try new things and test them out on our own without affecting anyone else. Once we\u2019re done making our changes, we make sure the site builds without any errors and then test out the new feature on our own PC. You might think this is standard practice in the industry, but some developers at other companies are changing code on live sites without testing it first, yikes!\nUnit tests are automated tests that developers write to test out the smallest chunks of code. Each small piece of code has many small automated tests that are run against it to ensure that each piece of the whole is working correctly. It\u2019s good practice to write tests that cover every possible outcome of each code block and to add new tests after each bug is found and fixed. These tests flush out bugs quickly because developers can run them in large batches after every code change they make. This gives us the confidence we need to change the code without injecting new bugs.\nOnce we\u2019re done writing our code and testing it locally we make sure the code looks good by proofreading it again before we commit it to the repository. I always review my own code before I commit it, and then I review it again after I submit it for peer review. I\u2019ve found many issues by reviewing my code twice.\nOnce a developer finishes a task, they create and assign a code review to all other developers on the project team. Team members read the code changes and make comments on any line they choose, just like we can in a Microsoft Word document. Often times we\u2019ll suggest re-using an already existing and tested piece of code instead of writing something new. Or, we\u2019ll simply point out spelling errors or places where the code is likely to fail if an error isn\u2019t handled properly.\nAt BizStream, we use Cypress, a JavaScript automated test runner. Our Cypress tests verify that the front end of our sites is what we expect it to be on a regular basis. We can run the tests locally as a developer or set them up to run daily against our development sites and live sites.\nWe also set up a \u201CCrawler\u201D on each site that runs every 24 hours. The crawler provides a report of all the URLs tested along with any errors and warnings that occur. This allows us to track down any bugs we might have created in the previous deployment.\nBizStream has a dedicated team of QA professionals. After peer code reviews are finished, the same task is assigned to our QA team. A QA team member will beat it up and find those edge cases we didn\u2019t think about during our developer testing. It\u2019s always good to have a second set of eyes re-read a task\u2019s acceptance criteria and make sure the work is done correctly.\nWe use Azure DevOps to automate our deployments. Manual deployments are risky, stressful, and time-consuming. When I performed manual deployments in the past, they sometimes took 2 to 4 hours and I had to follow a complicated process step by step or risk taking down a live site. An automated deployment can take 5 minutes or less to complete and can be set up to run at any time without a developer being present. Many live site problems are caused by failed deployments performed by humans. A developer may forget to copy a file over to a production server or forget to run a query to update a database. Sure, there may still be issues every now and then with automated deployments, but when they do arise, we fix the automation problem instead of the deployment problem, and it\u2019s often easier to automate the rollback process, which reduces the overall downtime.Even though our deployments are automated at BizStream, we still watch every live deployment to make sure it runs smoothly. If we need to intervene or restart the process, we\u2019re standing by. Once the code is deployed, the entire team makes sure every new feature is working as expected. We want to be the first to find any new bugs if they are out there.\nWe utilize multiple different sites for testing before we move our changes to a live production site. These are the usual sites:\nNow that we\u2019ve covered some good bug prevention steps, we\u2019ll talk about how we find live bugs and record them, so our clients and users don\u2019t have to.\nThe Kentico Xperience Content Management System (CMS) has its own built-in event log. It\u2019s good to skim through the log on a regular basis to make sure a site is running well. Errors are conveniently highlighted in red with dates, custom error messages, and sometimes even the exact line number where the bug occurred in the code. Our YouthCenter and CaseStream products utilize their own custom event logs that are crucial in helping us figure out what\u2019s causing a bug.\nAudit logs are used to determine who created, viewed, edited, or deleted items on a site. The Xperience CMS stores this information in the event log. BizStream\u2019s products implement their own version of an audit log. They help us figure out the \u201Cwho, what, when, and where\u201D of a bug before we start troubleshooting.\nWindows servers store IIS logs that can be used by developers to figure out issues when they arise when nothing is logged in the Event Log or Audit Log.\nIf you press your F12 button in your browser and view the console tab, there may be errors listed in red. Sometimes the errors are specific enough that we\u2019ll know exactly what the problem is without doing any further digging.\nIt\u2019s often helpful to run an automated service that sends some sort of notification message to the development team when errors occur. If needed, we can respond right away to an issue and solve it before more users find it.\nIf you\u2019re running the Xperience by Kentico CMS, you can add an e-mail address to the \u201CError notification e-mail address\u201D setting in the administration part of the site. You will then receive e-mails when errors occur.\nBizStream also utilizes RayGun on non-Xperience sites. RayGun is a software product that provides error monitoring, crash reporting, user monitoring, and real-time performance metrics. We have it set up to send us Slack messages whenever errors occur on our sites, so we never miss one.\nThe Xperience CMS provides many different tools out of the box for reporting and logging errors. However, some of our clients want a little more than what Kentico gives them. As a result, BizStream added the\u00A0Toolkit for Kentico. The Toolkit contains many software tools that enhance the Xperience CMS like Sitewide Search, Compare for Kentico Deployments, and Connect for integrating with CRM tools like ZoHo and Dynamics. However, two software packages in the Toolkit can help reduce issues on your site.\nConstant Care\u00A0automates the review of over 100 points of performance on a Kentico Xperience site and gives easy-to-follow instructions to get a site performing at its fullest.\nThe\u00A0Siteimprove\u00A0add-on is an integration between Siteimprove and\u202FKentico Xperience that streamlines workflow efficiencies for a web team. With this extension installed, a team can fix errors and optimize content directly within the editing environment. Once the detected issues have been assessed, they can be re-checked on the relevant page in real-time to determine if further actions are needed.\nFinally, we need to realize that bugs are unavoidable on live sites. It\u2019s nearly impossible to prevent all of them. The key is to gather all the relevant information from the available sources and fix the issue as fast as possible. The more information we get from our clients and users in our support e-mails, the quicker we can solve the problem. After we collect the information and fix the bug, we follow the same process as outlined above in the Bug Prevention section of this post before updating the live site again with the fix. Ensuring quality is a team effort that starts with prevention, continues with the use of logging and error reporting tools, and finishes with quick response times from everyone on the team when errors do occur.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"368","pageTitle":"CTCIAP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/custom-task-conditions-in-azure-pipelines/","text":"Custom Task Conditions in Azure Pipelines\nAzure Pipelines\u00A0is an Azure DevOps service that allows anyone to easily build, test, and deploy with CI/CD. These pipelines offer a ton of customization on their own with hundreds of available build tasks (steps), countless integrations, and triggers based on other builds completing or a set schedule. When it comes to customizing the pipeline tasks, however, things get a little more complicated.\nWhat if you only want to run a specific pipeline task on Mondays? What if you want to run certain tasks if the build was kicked off manually? What if you have a custom variable and want to run a task based on its value? All of these situations are made possible by the use of custom conditions in Azure Pipelines. This useful setting is hidden away on each pipeline task and will unlock customization options for all your needs.\nTo start off, there are a few easy steps we need to follow:\nNote: For this tutorial, I am using the Classic UI in Azure instead of YAML. If you are using YAML, the general approach should be similar enough to follow along. Let\u2019s continue!\nNow that we have our pipeline open and in edit mode, let\u2019s familiarize ourselves with the custom condition setting:\nNote: The \u201CRun this task\u201D selector has some predefined options that allow for some basic customization. For example, you can select \u201COnly when a previous task has failed\u201D if you want the task to only run if the build fails. One use for this would be if you want to send a Slack message to your team notifying them of the failure. For more in-depth customization, I recommend using the \u201CCustom conditions\u201D option, as it makes the possibilities virtually endless.\nAzure has some great documentation on\u00A0custom conditions, and they even give some\u00A0useful examples\u00A0to get you started. Reading through the examples will help you understand the expressions and how they are constructed. If you still have questions after looking at the examples, check out the documentation on\u00A0expressions\u00A0within Azure DevOps to understand the syntax for variables, functions, and more.\nAs we continue, I will show off some specific examples of useful custom conditions and then show you how to unlock even more possibilities with custom conditions paired with PowerShell scripts.\nFor each example, I will give a brief explanation of what the custom condition does and then show the syntax. Feel free to skip to the example that suits your needs or scroll to the PowerShell section for maximum customization, like running a task on a specific day of the week.\nExplanation:\u00A0You only want to run a task if one of your pipeline variables is set to false.\nExample: Run a task when system debug is set to false.\nCustom Condition:\nExplanation:\u00A0You only want to run a task when a variable equals a specific value.\nExample:\u00A0Send a Slack message if your notifications variable is set to public.\nCustom Condition:\nExplanation:\u00A0You only want to run a task if the build is queued manually through the Azure Pipelines UI or via the Azure API.Example:\u00A0Update the npm packages each time the build is run manually.Custom Condition:\nExplanation:\u00A0You only want to run a task when the build is queued via a schedule that is set on the Triggers tab.Example:\u00A0Publish the test results when the build is run on a schedule so that the number of results is consistent each week.Custom Condition:\nExplanation:\u00A0If the above options don\u2019t provide enough customization, PowerShell scripting may be your answer. A PowerShell script in your pipeline allows you to generate a variable and set its value to anything you want. You can get the value from an API call, function, date formatter, etc. After creating the variable, you can use it in your task\u2019s custom condition and run or ignore the task based on its value.Set Up:\nExample: Run a task only on Mondays that deletes the previous week\u2019s cached files.PowerShell Script:\nCustom Condition:\nThe above examples are just a small preview of all the possibilities that custom conditions bring to Azure Pipelines. If you are passionate about customization, I am sure you will find even more unique ways of customizing pipelines to fit your needs. Thanks to Microsoft\u2019s great documentation and examples, I was able to quickly learn about this feature and find practical uses for it in my daily work.Did you know about custom conditions before reading this article? How do you plan on using custom conditions to improve your build pipelines? Are you still having issues with understanding this feature? We are here to help, and we love feedback, so please send us an email with your comments or questions. Happy customizing!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

We expanded upon this implementation in\u00A0Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware\u00A0to support\u00A0Page Routing\u00A0via a custom Request Delegate. In this conclusion to the\u00A0Error Page in Kentico Xperience series, we\u2019ll explore the BizStream/xperience-status-code-pages repository, and how the two NuGet packages BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages \u0026 BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages\u00A0 published from it, can be used to quickly get started with StatusCodePages powered by Kentico Xperience.\nBizStream maintains two NuGet packages that can be used for quickly spinning up StatusCodePages in an Xperience solution:\nBizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages:\u00A0Contains an object archive defining a\u00A0StatusCodeNode, akin to the\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u00A0described in previous parts of this series, and a Module that auto-imports the included object archive, thus importing the\u00A0StatusCodeNode\u00A0Page Type object into the target EMS solution.\nBizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages: Contains the StatusCodePages middleware, a default controller and view, and extension methods to use Kentico Xperience-powered StatusCodePage in an ASP.NET Core MVC project.\nTo begin with Xperience StatusCodePages, the\u00A0BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages\u00A0package must be installed into the\u00A0CMSApp\u00A0project, using the \u201CInstall NuGet Packages\u201D option within Visual Studio, or using the\u00A0Package Manager Console:\nInstall-Package BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages\nUpon installing the Administration NuGet package, a\u00A0CMSSiteUtils/Import/BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip\u00A0file should now be visible within the Solution Explorer (if not, you may need to\u00A0Show All Files\u00A0in the project), this\u00A0Object Archive\u00A0contains the Page Types \u0026 Form Controls needed to manage Error Pages within the\u00A0Pages\u00A0application.\nTo finalize the installation of the Object Archive, start a new Debug session or execute Kentico CI against the target\u00A0CMSApp. This will result in the initialization of the\u00A0StatusCodePagesModule, which will execute the registered\u00A0IStatusCodePagesImportProvider\u00A0implementation to automatically import objects within the\u00A0BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip\u00A0archive.\nIf Kentico CI was run, XML files for the StatusCodeNode\u00A0Page Type, among other object types, should now exist in the CI Repository folder, or if a Debug session was run, the Event Log can be checked for errors from the StatusCodePagesImportProvider. After successfully importing objects, as indicated by the Event Log, the\u00A0BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip\u00A0file can be deleted locally and removed from the\u00A0CMSApp.csproj.\nThe Administration package contains build .props/.targets files that ensure the BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip archive is included in MSBuild Publish artifacts. This ensures the file exists when promoting the CMSApp through environments when using WebDeploy / Visual Studio Publish Profiles. When installing the Adminstration package, NuGet adds references to these .props/.targets files within the CMSApp.csproj.\nWith the Administration package installed and initialized,\u00A0StatusCodeNodes\u00A0can now be added to the Content Tree within the\u00A0Pages\u00A0application:\nIf the StatusCodeNode is not visible in the \u201CAdd Page\u201D menu, it may need to be manually assigned to the correct Site within the \u201CPage Types\u201D application.\nAfter installing the Administration package into the CMSApp, the BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages must be installed into the Xperience ASP.NET Core MVCMvc project:\ndotnet add package BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages\nOR\n\u003CPackageReference Include=\u0022 BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages\u0022 Version=\u0022x.x.x\u0022 /\u003E\nUpon installing the AspNetCore NuGet package, the Startup.cs must be updated to add required services, and to configure the middleware:\nFinally, the StatusCodeNode must be registered for Page Routing with Kentico. The AspNetCore package provides a default\u00A0Controller\u00A0\u0026\u00A0View\u00A0that can be registered using the\u00A0RegisterStatusCodePageRouteAttribute:\nBizStream recommends creating a\u00A0RegisterPageRoutes.cs file in the root of your MVC project. Additionally, BizStream recommends segmenting Kentico Xperience-related components of the MVC site in a Razor Class Library, for example, refer to the MVC.Kentico.Xperience Class Library in\u00A0BizStream/xperience-blog-template.\nAlternatively, if you require greater control, the base RegisterPageRouteAttribute provided by the Kentico API can be used for registering the route, for example:\nWith the packages installed, and a \u201CNot Found\u201D page configured in the Content Tree, debugging the MVC site in a mode other than\u00A0Development\u00A0and navigating to an invalid path shall yield a page from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree:\nLearn more about ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages \u002B Kentico Xperience Middleware on GitHub at\u00A0BizStream/xperience-status-code-pages.

In this predecessor to\u00A0Part I, we\u2019ll dip our toes into the waters of the ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages source to implement a custom\u00A0Request Delegate Middleware, allowing support for\u00A0Page Routing.\nAs\u00A0recommended by Microsoft, we\u2019ll start implementing our Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware by defining an extension method that targets\u00A0IApplicationBuilder, to expose the usage of\u00A0UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func\u003CStatusCodeContext,Task\u003E)\u00A0to configure the StatusCodePages middleware.We\u2019ll start our implementation with the WithRedirects extension:\nIf the path of an\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u00A0can be retrieved via\u00A0GetErrorNodePathAsync, we instruct the response to redirect to the retrieved path. In\u00A0GetErrorNodePathAsync, we use the\u00A0IErrorPageRetriever\u00A0from\u00A0Part I\u00A0to retrieve an\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u00A0for the current response, and Kentico\u2019s\u00A0IPageUrlRetriever\u00A0to retrieve the path for the respective\u00A0HttpErrorNode. By using Kentico\u2019s\u00A0IPageUrlRetriever, our Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware will automatically support the\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u0027s\u00A0configured\u00A0Page Routing\u00A0behavior.To learn more about the details of Kentico\u2019s\u00A0IPageUrlRetriever\u00A0service, check out Sean G. Wright\u2019s excellent piece \u201CBits of Xperience: The Hidden Cost of IPageUrlRetriever.Retrieve\u201C.That static\u00A0GetErrorNodePathAsync\u00A0method though,\u00A0kind of gross. Just as was done with the\u00A0ErrorController\u00A0example from Part I, a \u201CRetriever\u201D service can be defined to make the implementation more concise and extensible.\nAdd our service to the IServiceCollection in the Startup, and we\u2019ve once again made our code a bit more concise.\nThe ASP.NET Core source code for the\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute\u00A0extension method on\u00A0GitHub\u00A0shall serve as a solid reference for how to support\u00A0ReExecute\u00A0functionality. Reviewing the source code, there are\u00A04 lines\u00A0of particular interest:\nThese 4 lines format the string arguments passed to\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute\u00A0that create the path to\u00A0ReExecute\u00A0the request pipeline on. We can base our implementation off of the framework\u2019s source for UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute, replacing these four lines with a call to our\u00A0GetErrorNodePathAsync\u00A0method. This will ensure that our custom Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware\u2019s behavior is compatible with the behavior of the StatusCodePages Middleware when using\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute\u00A0out-of-the-box, ensuring additional middleware in the request pipeline that may depend on the\u00A0IStatusCodeReExecuteFeature\u00A0will continue to behave correctly, just as expected.\nThe next step is to register the\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u00A0for Kentico Xperience\u00A0Page Routing, refactoring the\u00A0ErrorController\u00A0to use Kentico\u2019s\u00A0IPageDataContextRetriever.\n@Model.Heading\n@Model.Content\nFinally, update the Startup.cs to use our desired Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages middleware behavior:\nRequests to the MVCMvc site at paths that produce a 404: Not Found status code will now return the Content and Heading from an HttpErrorNode where HttpStatusCode = 404:\nPage Not Found\n...\nLearn more about ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages \u002B Kentico Xperience Middleware on GitHub at\u00A0BizStream/xperience-status-code-pages.

{"id":"373","pageTitle":"PIAITAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/part-1-an-introduction-to-asp-net-statuscodepages/","text":"Part I: An Introduction to ASP.NET StatusCodePages\nIn almost every MVC\u00A0site I\u2019ve developed on the Kentico Xperience Platform, there has been one feature that has never quite felt \u201Cright\u201D:\u00A0Error Pages.\nWhether it\u2019s due to confusing configuration\u00A0(looking at you, System.Web), awkward routing and redirects in controllers, or multiple, sometimes ambiguous, patterns for handling exceptions (looking at you again, System.Web), creating user-friendly error pages in Kentico Xperience MVC sites don\u2019t always seem straight-forward.\nIt\u2019s time\u00A0for a reckoning.\nIn this 3-part series, we\u2019ll be covering the background to BizStream\u2019s\u00A0xperience-status-code-pages\u00A0packages, reviewing how the ASP.NET Core\u00A0StatusCodePages\u00A0pattern can be extended to serve user-friendly error pages from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree.\nWithin the ASP.NET Core framework, StatusCodePages\u00A0is a pattern for providing a response body, based on the response\u2019s status code.\nThe StatusCodePages pattern provides a variety of\u00A0IApplicationBuilder\u00A0extension methods that configure the behavior of the underlying middleware, and allow developers some options as to how the response should be handled. Of these extension methods,\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute\u00A0is particularly attractive, as it allows developers to specify a path upon which to re-execute the request pipeline.\nAn advantage to \u201CReExecute\u201D over \u201CRedirect\u201D, is that the original URL is preserved in the client. A request to\u00A0/not-a-real-url that produces a 404: Not Found\u00A0status code is returned to the requested URL,\u00A0/not-a-real-url, rather than redirecting the client to\u00A0/error?code=404. If you\u2019re a veteran ASP.NET developer with IIS Rewrite Module experience: a \u201CReExecute\u201D is similar to a \u201CRewrite\u201D, as opposed to a \u201CRedirect\u201D\nFor Example:\nAn additional advantage to this pattern is that in other controllers, the base Controller.NotFound\u00A0method can be used, as opposed to redirecting to a custom \u201CNotFound\u201D action:\nThe RedirectToAction( \u0022NotFound\u0022, \u0022Error\u0022 )\u00A0is a common pattern I often see in Kentico Xperience MVC sites, wherein the\u00A0NotFound\u00A0action queries the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for some type of NotFoundNode.\nIn many cases, we\u2019d like to give Content Editors the ability to manage the content of Error Pages. This can be achieved by building upon the\u00A0ErrorController\u00A0from the previous example to query and serve content from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree:\nThat\u2019s quite a bit of query logic in the controller\u2026\nWe can clean that up by defining a service to compose the\u00A0IPageRetriever\u00A0usage and query logic. We\u2019ll try to work with Kentico\u2019s\u00A0\u201CPage Retrievers\u201D\u00A0pattern here by defining an\u00A0IErrorPageRetriever\u00A0that describes the retrieval of an\u00A0HttpErrorNode:\nAdd our services to the\u00A0IServiceCollection\u00A0in the\u00A0Startup, and the\u00A0ErrorController\u00A0is a bit more concise.\nAll of this is nice, except for\u00A0one. little. thing.\u00A0/error?code={0}. All of the error pages are accessed at the\u00A0/error\u00A0path with a query string, Yuck! An ideal solution would allow us to use\u00A0Page Routing\u00A0to give Content Editors the ability to configure the URLs\u00A0of the error pages, just like any other node in the Content Tree.\u00A0Page Routing\u00A0would also give greater flexibility to support\u00A0Redirect\u00A0or\u00A0ReExecute\u00A0behaviors.\nWe are now presented with a new problem:\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute\u00A0and\u00A0UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects\u00A0require\u00A0a\u00A0specific\u00A0path string that must be known when\u00A0Startup.Configure(IApplicationBuilder)\u00A0is invoked and the\u00A0UseStatusCodePages*\u00A0method is called. In order to make Page Routing work, the StatusCodePages middleware requires a means of dynamically querying the Content Tree for the\u00A0PageUrl\u00A0of the expected\u00A0HttpErrorNode\u00A0in which the request should\u00A0Redirect\u00A0to or\u00A0ReExecute.\nUnfortunately, neither of the\u00A0WithRedirects\u00A0or\u00A0WithReExecute\u00A0extensions provide overloads that would allow dynamic retrieval of the path to\u00A0Redirect\u00A0to or\u00A0ReExecute\u00A0on. There is still hope, however, thanks to the\u00A0UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func\u003CStatusCodeContext,Task\u003E)\u00A0overload. This overload allows a\u00A0Func\u003CStatusCodeContext, Task\u003E\u00A0delegate to be passed, which effectively functions as a\u00A0Request Delegate\u00A0via the\u00A0StatusCodeContext.\nIn\u00A0Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware, we\u2019ll explore how\u00A0UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func\u003CStatusCodeContext,Task\u003E)\u00A0can be used to implement our own\u00A0WithRedirects/WithReExecute\u00A0extension methods that query the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for the\u00A0PageUrl\u00A0to\u00A0Redirect\u00A0to or\u00A0ReExecute\u00A0on, in a manner that is compatible with the behavior of the extensions provided by the framework.\nIf you are looking for more help with your Kentico Xperience projects, feel free to\u00A0reach out to BizStream directly.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

What in the world actually\u00A0happens\u00A0when you click this button?\nIt can be intimidating to attempt to capture all of that information so that, 12 months later, when your team is finishing up that last feature, you still remember what it\u2019s supposed to do. That\u2019s why I wanted to share some of my hard-won-by-making-all-the-mistakes experience with you and hopefully make your next discovery project that much more effective.\nThis first one seems obvious but can be more challenging than you might realize. Why? \u00A0Because oftentimes, it\u2019s easy for us to categorize some things as \u201Csmall or trivial\u201D when in reality, they end up becoming very important down the road during implementation.\nWe\u2019re constantly taking in information from everything around us; way more than our brain can process, so it prunes out information it doesn\u2019t see as important, so you can focus on what is. (Fun fact, did you know that your\u00A0nose is in your field of vision all the time, but your brain just edits it out, so you don\u2019t see it? Weird, right?). With that level of experience editing information as it comes in, you would think we\u2019d be pretty good at it, but unfortunately, that skill doesn\u2019t quite transfer here. So my rule is to write down way more than I think I should. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times some random off-handed remark that I jotted down was the answer to a question we had weeks or even months later.\nOf course, you can\u2019t get it all. Unless you\u2019re a court stenographer, writing\u00A0everything\u00A0down is hard and, if you\u2019re doing that, you likely don\u2019t have much bandwidth left over to think through and respond to what is being said. You know the \u201Canalyze\u201D part of the Business Analyst title? So if you miss something, don\u2019t beat yourself up. Just make sure to always, always, ALWAYS record the meetings, so you can go back and review them later, remembering that digging through hours of stale conference calls can be time-consuming, so consider it more of a last resort.\nMore data is only better when it\u2019s the right data. Otherwise, you\u2019re just creating your very own proverbial haystack for yourself to find the proverbial needle in. Thinking through the architecture and taxonomy of your documentation is as important as the architecture and taxonomy of the project itself. Obviously, it is extremely important for a developer to know what a feature needs to do. However, knowing the strategy about why the client decided on that particular shade of blue for the background color of the feature is likely not.\nKeep every shred of information you gather filed away somewhere, but be mindful about overwhelming people with lots of information irrelevant to what they need to do. It usually just leads to confusion and opportunities for varying interpretations. As you may be able to tell from this blog post, I rarely use 1 word when 20 will do. That\u2019s not usually a good idea when providing information to a developer to complete a task. Context is great, but it\u2019s rarely necessary to read the whole novel to know how they need the contact form wired up.\nI was going to suggest a drinking game where you take a shot for every one of the tools above that you\u2019ve used in the last year, but I care about your safety. Those of us of a certain age might be familiar with the phrase \u201CThe truth is out there\u201D from the X-Files. That search for the truth was compelling for a TV show but should not be a feature in your documentation.\nSo you\u2019ve written down as much as you can. You\u2019ve organized all your notes and recordings. You\u2019ve distilled that information down to focused tasks without too much fluff in their descriptions. But, ultimately, there needs to be a single place that documents the way things are going to work. At BizStream we utilize\u00A0Jira. Discovery notes and internal meetings turn into tickets and, once the client approves the tickets, those become law. My notes are still there for reference and context, but the Jira ticket trumps everything else (again, once approved by the client).\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be external documentation that fills out the information on the tickets. Things such as designs, sanitized test data, and other items that don\u2019t make sense to add to the Jira ticket live in our shared Google Drive. The key here is to link those assets directly to the ticket. That way, there is no question about which design, flowchart, etc., applies to this exact task.\nOR\nOR\nAfter spending so much time talking about how things should work, taking notes, documenting final decisions, distilling that information into actionable tasks, etc., it might feel a little, well, embarrassing to ask the client for more information. Especially when you know it\u2019s something you previously discussed, but it didn\u2019t make it to the documentation for one reason or another.\nIn development, we know that doing your best to hit all the acceptance criteria right the first time is far more efficient. Otherwise, you can get into a cycle of back and forth with QA finding bugs and sending them back to the developer, the developer fixing them and sending them back to QA, and then QA spending time re-evaluating those bugs. That is all with the specifics clearly defined and rock solid! Why make a guess, however, educated, at what the client wanted on a certain feature rather than just confirming it with them? Does that mean emailing the client 12 times a day? No. After all is said and done, though, the client is the one paying for something to be built the way they want it to be. So make sure everyone knows what that is.\nSo none of these concepts are exactly groundbreaking research. They are all pretty common sense things you may have looked at and thought, \u201Cduh\u201D (people still say \u201Cduh\u201D, right?). My experience, however, has been that we all need reminding from time to time. Things get busy, we fall into bad habits, we get lazy, and so on. There are even times when we\u00A0think\u00A0we\u2019re doing a certain practice well but, when you really stop to think of it, you realize it was more of an\u2026 ideal you had in your mind rather than\u00A0something you\u2019re actually doing. Sometimes it takes hearing something you\u2019ve heard before one last time before it finally clicks into place. Whatever the case may be, I hope you found something useful.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"377","pageTitle":"CARVCFCIXM","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/creating-a-recaptcha-v3-custom-form-component-in-xperience-mvc/","text":"Creating a reCAPTCHA v3 Custom Form Component in Xperience MVC\nLet\u2019s say you want to safeguard your site\u2019s forms from spam by utilizing reCAPTCHA v3 so that you don\u2019t have to render the reCAPTCHA challenge in your nicely designed form that you built with Xperience\u2019s Form Builder. Enter custom form components. Custom form components allow you to define new form components that can be used by content administrators when building new forms in Form Builder. In this blog post, I will show you how we can leverage custom form components to add google\u2019s reCAPTCHA v3 via client-side code and validate the key that is returned by the reCAPTCHA API on the server side.\nMost of the general setup for creating a custom form component is outlined in the Xperience documentation, so if you are looking to create other custom form components, that is a good place to start. For this blog post, I will be showing specifically how to implement a reCAPTCHA v3 custom form component.\nThe first step will be to create a folder called \u201CFormComponents\u201D to hold all the classes related to your custom form component(s). This needs to be at the root of your Web project, ~/Models/FormComponents.\nNext, create a \u201CFormComponentProperties\u201D folder within the \u201CFormComponents\u201D (/Models/FormComponents/FormComponentProperties) folder and then create a new InvisibleReCaptchaV3Properties properties class.\nHere are a couple of things to note about the code snippet below.\nSettingsKeyInfoProvider.GetValue(\u0022reCaptchaV3SiteKey\u0022, SiteContext.CurrentSiteID) is using CMS.DataEngine to retrieve custom site settings that are defined in the Xperience admin. To create these custom settings, navigate to the Modules application in the Xperience admin. If you don\u2019t already have a Custom module for your site, create one. Edit the Custom module and go to Settings in the left sidebar. Once you are in the Settings, create a \u201CNew settings group\u201D titled reCAPTCHA v3 Keys (or whatever you would like to call it) and within that group, create two new settings keys with code names reCaptchaV3SiteKey and reCaptchaV3SecretKey. The code name of these settings keys needs to match the first parameter that you pass to the SettingsKeyInfoProvider.GetValue:\nNext, we will create a partial view, which is responsible for rendering the form component. In our case, we are only using the form input to hold the reCAPTCHA token value. Since the user does not need to see or know about the reCAPTCHA token, we will add a hidden class to hide the input from view.\nWe will then use the value of the input (which will be the reCAPTCHA token) on the server side to validate the token. This is also where we will add the JavaScript that will programmatically invoke the reCAPTCHA challenge. If you would like to read more about reCAPTCHA or need to know how to get a reCAPTCHA site key and secret key, here is a link to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA documentation.\nNext, you will want to create a new JavaScript file that will hold all of our logic for registering the reCAPTCHA. If you follow along in the JavaScript, the first thing we do when the window loads is call the getFormOnSubmitFunction and removeFormOnSubmitFunction functions. Those calls then get the value of the inline onsubmit function that is on the \u003Cform\u003E element, sets it to a window object property to be referenced later, and then removes it from the form component. This allows us to programmatically invoke the reCAPTCHA challenge and validate the token before the Xperience form is submitted. We also add an event listener to listen for submit events. When a submit event occurs, the onClick function is called. This function contains the code that programmatically invokes the reCAPTCHA challenge.\nBe sure to add this JavaScript file to your partial view that is responsible for rendering all of your site-wide JavaScript bundles in the footer of the HTML.\nIf the\u00A0grecaptcha.execute()\u00A0method is successful, it returns a reCAPTCHA token. We need to validate this token on the server side. In order to have access to that token, we set it to the value of the reCAPTCHA custom form component input that we created. Since we created a new validation rule (see \u201CCreate a New Validation Rule\u201D section), as long as we select this validation rule in Form Builder, the\u00A0Validate()\u00A0method will get called with the input\u2019s value passed in.\nOne thing to note here is that we are adding a\u00A0hidden\u00A0class to the input. You can name your class whatever you would like or use an existing utility class that you have. This hidden class adds\u00A0display: none\u00A0to the input so that the element is not displayed and has no effect on the layout of the page.\nAt the root of your Web project, create a\u00A0ReCaptchaV3Validation.cs\u00A0file. This file will go in a new\u00A0~/FormBuilder/ValidationRules\u00A0folder. This creates a new validation rule that is available to select for a form component in Form Builder. When the form is submitted, the\u00A0Validate()\u00A0method will be called with the input\u2019s value passed in. The value is the reCAPTCHA token that we can pass to the reCAPTCHA API, along with your site secret key. If the validation is successful, google returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 0 being that the interaction on your site was very likely a bot, and 1.0 indicating that the interaction was very good and is most likely a human. That\u2019s it! The only step left is to add your new custom form component to a form in Xperience Form Builder.\nThe last step of the process is to add your new form component to a form on your site via Form Builder. Navigate to the Forms application in the Xperience admin, create a new form or edit an existing one, and click on Form Builder. Click on the \u201C\u002B\u201D button to add a new form component. You should see your new form component listed here; select it. Next, click on the Validation tab in the right sidebar, and you should see the custom validation rule you created previously in the dropdown menu. You now have a fully functioning reCAPTCHA v3 implementation that is invisible to the user but protects your form from bots!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"380","pageTitle":"EPBWWCWCIKX","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/enhancing-page-builder-widgets-with-custom-web-components-in-kentico-xperience/","text":"Enhancing Page Builder Widgets With Custom Web Components in Kentico Xperience\nOne of the many great features of Kentico is being able to create custom widgets for use in page builder, and there are several ways to implement custom behavior in those widgets. One way that we at BizStream have found to enhance widget behavior on the client-side is through custom Web Components.\nWeb components are, in the simplest sense, custom HTML elements that are written and implemented in JavaScript. They are similar to components in Angular, React, Vue, etc., except they are built-in for all modern browsers. There is a wealth of information on web components on\u00A0MDN, and I highly recommend reading their documentation.\nThere are a few reasons why you might want to use web components to enhance your widgets in Kentico.First of all, there is no build step required. If you are used to using a framework like Angular and React, you know a lot goes into setting up the project. With web components, all you need to start is JavaScript code.Another benefit is\u00A0progressive enhancement. Web components, when implemented correctly, will allow adding functionality to a web page, but in such a way as to not break the functionality of the web page if JavaScript is disabled and will not hinder a page\u2019s accessibility.Finally, web components give the developer a way to encapsulate functionality fully within the custom component, using the\u00A0Shadow DOM, and allows a Kentico widget to easily pass options from the server-side to the client-side through attributes.\nTo demonstrate all this, we will make a custom pager component which can be added to a listing widget.\nStart by creating a listing widget. Creating new widgets in Kentico is well documented\u00A0here, but here is a sample piece of code that could be used to get a listing of articles using a C# View Component:\nThen in our view component markup, we could have something like this:\nArticle Listing\nNote the\u00A0\u003Clisting-pager\u003E\u00A0element. That is our custom component which we will create next\nTo create the pager web component, first add a javascript file and make sure it is imported in the site. To start, we will declare a class for our component and implement the base element class, making sure to implement a constructor. We will also scaffold out the rest of the methods to be implemented later.\nThere are quite a few methods here, so let\u2019s get started! We will implement each method in turn. To start, we will implement the\u00A0constructor.\nNext, we will implement the method that will query the \u201CPer Page\u201D attribute from the markup. We are implementing this method as a class getter to simplify its usage in the rest of the code.\nNext are the \u201Clifecycle\u201D methods for our custom element. First, the\u00A0connectedCallback\u00A0method will be used to set up events and anything else that needs initialization in our element.\nThe\u00A0disconnectedCallback\u00A0method will be used for any and all cleanup we need to do for our element.\nNow, we will get into the meat of our component and implement the main events and functionality. The first event we will set is for when a selected page changes.\nNext comes the event for when content is added or removed to the slot within out custom element.\nThe following two methods are utility methods for adding or removing buttons for selecting the current page. In the\u00A0addPageButton\u00A0method we will manually set the IDs and the\u00A0data-page\u00A0attributes for each button and use these in other methods. Since we have control of each button and its functionality in our element, we can safely make some assumptions and implement our own desired way things should work and interact, but best practices should always be followed, and the inner workings of our element should always be documented, especially since we have so much control of the code.\nThe\u00A0removePageButton\u00A0will query for the button corresponding to the method\u2019s input, clean it up and remove it from our button list.\nThere are only two methods left! They hold the code for updating the content and buttons in our element, so let us dive into each one.The next method we will implement is for updating the buttons. As seen earlier this will be called when content is added or removed from the slot, including any content already inside the slot in existing markup. This method will validate and calculate the number of pages based on the desired amount of items per page and add or remove buttons from our element accordingly.\nThe final method will update the visibility of the slotted content based on the current page that has been selected.\nOur element is finally complete, but there is one final step to make the Web Component usable. We need to register our custom element so that the DOM knows what it is. Here is how we do that.\nWith that, our element has been defined and we can use it on any page where the above code is imported or defined. There is quite a bit of code here, but the main goal here is to demonstrate how a larger custom element might be defined and implemented. At this point, there are also some things that need to be improved upon. For instance, if\u00A0per-page\u00A0is larger than the number of children there will still always be one page button created even though a button is not needed for only one page of content. There is also no styling which can be added in a\u00A0style\u00A0element explicitly and attached to the\u00A0shadowRoot. But, in general, for a small to average amount of items this pager should work great.\nOne final thing to highlight is that having a new slotted custom element opens up several other opportunities. Not only can this be used to enhance Page Builder widgets, but this can also be used to enhance Page Builder sections as well! Using the pager we have already defined, we can use it just as easily to add paging to an entire section like this:\nUsing this same idea, we can define and implement tabbed content in a section:\nThe full implementation of tabs in the above example is quite a bit more complex, and I might revisit this idea in a future post.\nWith the flexibility and functionality that Web Components provide, we wind up with a lot of options and power at our fingertips. I hope this post has sparked some interest in looking deeper into Web Components and how they can be used, not only in Kentico but anywhere on the web.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"381","pageTitle":"HTONTMIAVW","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-onboard-new-team-members-in-a-virtual-workplace/","text":"How to Onboard New Team Members in a Virtual Workplace\nWhile the last 15 months introduced many unique challenges to the workforce, we recently had to address how to onboard multiple new staff members.\nBefore the pandemic, Bizstream had a hybrid work schedule that offered employees the option to be in the office three days a week and work from home the other two. We had never been in a situation where not only was a new hire going to be remote, but the rest of the staff was as well. We wanted to ensure that all new hires felt immediately welcome and part of a team and were not lost in the shuffle or felt disconnected, which we already monitored with our existing employees. We did a few things that made an immediate impact, and overall, the feedback we received from the new hires is that the onboarding process was well beyond what they expected.\nOne of the first things we did before day one was to compile the gear each new hire needed, along with a few extras. We found a time where they could meet us at the office and, even though it was practically empty, get a tour of the space and leave with their equipment and some fun swag. We wanted to give them a sense of what they, one day soon, would hopefully be walking into (what can we say, we love our space). We also provided some books that we use to help our team understand our culture and how we like to operate.\nWhile we provide a laptop, we also were mindful of the situation and tried to provide any other ancillary materials that would help them set up a workspace that would be close to what they would have in the office, including monitors, cables, keyboard, and mouse. Lastly, their gear package includes our LAB book, or \u201CLife at BizStream.\u201D\nThe LAB book is a collection of information about what someone new can expect at BizStream. It includes common things specific to our culture, like how to use Sonos, helpful Slack channels, special time tracking notes, planned holidays, office events, etc. It is something we provide to someone on their first day in the office, but even as people are remote, we think it still helps team members get to know BizStream and our unique culture even without experiencing it firsthand.\nAnother thing we like to provide before someone starts is a detailed agenda for their first day. We figure that starting a new job is already a little bit stressful, and having some idea of what to expect that first day will look like provides some comfort. The same goes with working fully remote. We don\u2019t want someone sitting at their computer not knowing who or when someone would reach out to tell them whatever comes next. Actually, you can read more about a new hire\u2019s first day\u00A0here.\nWe also like to kick off each new hire day with a team meeting where we introduce the entire staff. We\u2019ve been able to have some fun with this! To get it to go smoothly, we have a list of every team member in order of years they\u2019ve been at Bizstream (down to two decimal places) or days in the office. On top of that, we\u2019ve incorporated some fun icebreakers for each person to include, such as \u201CWhat is your favorite superhero?\u201D \u201CWhat is your dream car?\u201D or \u201CWhat is your favorite stompy mech movie/game/comic/manga?\u201D\nOn their first day, we present them with their onboarding plan. While this is also something that we have provided pre-COVID, we made sure to spend more time on it and detail it as much as possible. It spans a new hire\u2019s first three months and provides a clear list of expectations and milestone dates for achieving them. It includes our core values, what their position is accountable and responsible for, key meetings, and provided training. We treat it as a bit of a living document that the manager reviews with the new hire every week and determines if things are on track or if we need to make some adjustments. If both parties agree that a change is needed, it is noted in the onboarding plan, and we move forward.\nOne of the changes we made to our process is scheduling meetings throughout the first few weeks so that the new team members could spend some time with each team or department and get to know each other better. We were missing out on the in-office opportunities of saying hello when getting coffee or grabbing lunch together, so we decided to be more intentional about getting people together. As we are starting to move back into the office fully, we decided this is something we should keep going. Previously, we have had people that wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to work with another team, so getting them connected and talking early on feels like a no-brainer at this point.\nThe last thing we did to make new hires feel welcome is organize a parking lot party. Following the latest government mandates at the time, we would optionally invite everyone to the office and have chairs, some drinks, pre-packaged snacks, and hang out from a short distance (you all know the drill by now) in our parking lot. While it worked fine to do everything virtually, there is still something to be said for face-to-face communication. It was good to bring people together (while separate) for some social interaction and get to know each other in person.\nWe really like to hear from our new team members so we can figure out what we are doing right and what we could improve on. So far, we have received great feedback regarding our revised onboarding process, with some saying it was the best they\u2019ve seen.

While the new guidelines are in the process of being tweaked based on\u00A0public feedback, the overall goal is to provide easy-to-understand guidelines that strengthen support for broader needs, including diverse cognitive abilities and disabilities.\nWe wanted to take a fresh look at what was needed in accessibility guidelines. We worked with academic and corporate researchers to identify priorities. We brought together industry leaders in a design sprint to brainstorm new approaches. We spent years proposing, debating, and discarding prototypes until we agreed on this draft.\nThe new guidelines provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities by encouraging better experience for:\nWhile nothing is set in stone yet, we have a good idea of what\u2019s to come. There are only five guidelines in WCAG 3 so far. Each guideline was selected to demonstrate a feature of the new structure. They are still being worked through and will most likely change in a future version. As of now, they are as follows:\nBroader testing methods are set to be implemented with the rollout of WCAG 3. These new testing methods will consider all five categories of disability (vision, auditory process, physical ability, cognitive ability, and speech). We can expect these scoring methods to include:\nTesting is based on user journeys instead of testing sample pages, enabling more flexible conformance.\nLevels A, AA, and AAA will be replaced by a new conformance rating that is designed to encourage teams to improve continuously. The new conformance levels are:\nIf your score is high enough in each disability category, then you achieve Bronze level. We expect that Bronze level will be the level recommended for regulations.\nSo, how soon do you and your team need to take action? Thankfully, we have a lot of time to prepare. WCAG 3 is a rough first draft, and it will likely be years before it is finalized. While it will eventually replace WCAG 2 when it is complete, it\u2019s expected that WCAG 2 will remain valid even after WCAG 3 has officially launched. In the meantime, it\u2019s recommended to concentrate on meeting WCAG 2.1 and keep an eye on WCAG 2.2, which is expected to be released in the summer of 2021.\nThis is just a high-level overview of what\u2019s expected when WCAG 3 rolls out.

Make Sure Your Website Does This.\nAttracting new members is a top priority for all associations and member-based organizations (MBOs). Trouble is, convincing them that you\u2019re worth their time and money.\nHow, then, can you grow your membership base? What\u2019s the secret to effective membership recruitment?\nBy telling a better story and building a better website, you can convert interested prospects into new, engaged members.\nEffective association membership marketing is easier said than done, though. That\u2019s why in this blog, you\u2019ll find helpful insights like:\nThe pandemic exposed how much associations and MBOs rely on events, both for revenue and recruiting new members.\nNow, in an event landscape divided by in-person and remote experiences, MBOs are placing greater emphasis on two major trends, one of which is building a better website.\nWhy are MBOs strengthening their marketing with a better digital presence?\nA primary reason is to attract new members. This audience, typically younger and digitally savvy, quickly searches for what value they can expect from your website and other online experiences. Oftentimes, their decision to join depends on your ability to effectively provide a great online experience.\nThe website ideas and strategies below are based on BizStream\u2019s experience working with associations and MBO\u2019s websites and marketing programs. These will not only help you with membership recruitment, but also can improve ties with existing members, resulting in better retention year over year.\nA top reason why people join associations is for connection. People are naturally wired to participate in communities of people with shared interests.\nYour website is the place to foster and strengthen connections. It\u2019s where your members go to find engagement opportunities. While in person connections are great, the truth is your website is open 24/7, making it an extremely convenient and accessible destination. For new members, your website is often the first exposure to your organization and the launching pad toward establishing themselves in your community.\nUnfortunately, many MBO websites miss the mark. Information is obscured, lost in complex navigation and user-averse, instead of user-friendly experiences.\nHow can you correct this online connection conundrum?\nFrom an information accessibility standpoint, consider:\nIf you feel confident that your site\u2019s taxonomy and navigation are clear, then there are two other ways to strengthen your community:\nWhen we interview members as part of our website discovery and audit process, we always hear that finding information is a struggle. That, and knowing who to contact for questions.\nAwareness is another major struggle for MBOs. But what if we told you there\u2019s a free membership recruitment hack right in front of you?\nWe\u2019re talking about sharing your existing members\u2019 stories to advertise the value your organization offers. If prospects hear true stories from real members, that may be the nudge they need to sign up.\nToday, many people are skeptical of claims coming from companies. They want authentic accounts from real customers. That helps explain why social influencers and brand ambassadors are popular.\nThe importance of developing a clear and seamless onboarding experience can\u2019t be overstated. What does this mean for your website, though?\nIt means investing in great user experience (UX) design and intuitive navigation.\nConsider creating a welcome video to ensure members know where to find information. If you want to take this a step further, use a tool such as Pendo, which takes users on a guided tour of your website or app.\nHave you ever asked yourself: What\u2019s something you can provide that no organization can?\nWe\u2019ve found this question is integral to unlocking your website\u2019s unique value proposition and keeping members engaged.\nFor example, many associations offer professional development certifications. Some of them, especially in technical industries, require members to log a minimum number of hours toward obtaining certifications.\nThis fundamental insight led to a brilliant idea: What if you made it easy for people to log those hours under their profile on your website? What if others could see their progress? Or maybe they could add professional accolades to their profile or display which association committees they participate in? The possibilities are endless.\nThe goal with stickiness, also known as \u201Crecurring engagement,\u201D is finding ways to seamlessly deliver value to entice your audience to become return website visitors. If you can master stickiness, you\u2019ll prove to new, prospective members that your organization is offering value they can\u2019t afford to miss.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a marketing technology partner who has proven experience working with association and member-based organizations, contact our team.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

The proverbial \u201Cbreaking point\u201D for me. Let\u2019s talk about the metaphorical mental cocktail that I\u2019d been perfecting for some time. Take one shot of 14-month isolation, mix vigorously with equal parts government mandates, and fancy bar graphs depicting deaths per million. Add one teaspoon of a vitriol presidential election for flavor and garnish with a lawsuit from an unhappy customer who just wants to have a wedding during a global pandemic (I own a wedding venue as a side gig).\nOnce I had perfected its potency, I took a big swig on March 3rd and then stared at my computer screen for 15 minutes before realizing that I simply could not work that day. The laptop was closed. Not a word was spoken to my colleagues. I simply got out of my chair with no real plan. \u00A0As a PM, not having a plan is kind of a big deal. Engage cerebral autopilot.\nGet Keys.Get coat.Walk to car.Place keys in car.Drive.Continue driving.Don\u2019t stop driving.\nDuring the pandemic, my wife pointed out that \u201CIt\u2019s Fine\u201D had become a bit of a daily overindulgence for my vocabulary, brutally forced into my subconscious after months of throwing my hands up in the air at every mention of the word COVID or lockdown. It was my feeble attempt at trying to brush it all off.\nI started using this phrase mostly as a joke.\u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s Fine.\u201D\nAnother six months of lockdowns? It\u2019s fine.\u00A0My favorite restaurant closed again? It\u2019s fine.We are facing our 4th lawsuit in three months. It\u2019s\u2026fine?\nYou get the idea. I had hit a point where I simply needed to disengage and shut down for a bit. To quote the IT Crowd, I tried turning it off and then back on again. It had taken months for me to finally come to the realization that things weren\u2019t okay, and honestly, that\u2019s okay. We all know that times are rather strange right now. Like a three-year-old throwing a tantrum, I refused to submit to the notion that this was the \u201Cnew normal.\u201D As a coping mechanism, I hid behind words like \u201Cit\u2019s okay\u201D or the all-too-classic meme.\nThis is fine. Everything is fine.\nThe truth is, I was not okay. I needed a day to reflect. To shut down and perform a hard system reboot. Clear the cache and start fresh.

Giving this much power to content admins can be a little worrisome when you\u2019re used to more structured content, but giving your content admins the freedom to customize their pages without calling you for redesigns will keep them happy. I\u2019m going to highlight some of our custom generic column sections and our carousel and configurator widgets below.\nInstead of having multiple sections cluttering the section selection menu to handle all the client requirements, we made a generic column section. The section properties has a simple dropdown for the content admin to select the desired number of columns.\nIn the section\u2019s view, we set the Bootstrap class to the colCount divided by twelve to obtain even Widget Zones. In the case of the admin selecting five columns, Bootstrap rounds down the \u201C2.4\u201D to 2.\nThe result is dynamic and provides a lot of customization to the content admin without flooding them with too many section options.\nWe wanted to provide the client with a highly diversifiable carousel widget so each carousel fits their needs. We\u2019re using SwiperJs for its vast amount of customization and ease of use. If you look at those Swiper demos, it would\u2019ve been easy for us to go overboard with the widget properties.\nInstead, we contained it to what the client specifically wanted and some nice to haves. Using the PathSelector widget property type allowed us to mix structured content and the flexibility of page builder. Before creating the carousel widget, the content admin would need to create the slides by populating a folder with our Slide page type. Then add in the carousel widget and edit the properties to select the folder they just created.\nIn the CarouselWidgetController class (below), we\u2019re using the selected path to get all the children in that carousel folder and its children (slides).\nBuilding clean reusable widgets and sections will speed up your development for future projects and give your content administrators the confidence to create the pages they need.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

In the never-ending process of improving our speed and efficiency, we reached a point where we knew automation could help enhance our testing. More specifically, we wanted to improve and automate our manually repetitive and regression types of testing. A variety of languages and testing tools were explored to help us do just that. After some searching, a colleague of mine, Tyler Pfohl, came across Cypress.\nAs a non-developer, it has been quite an adventure (and a steep learning curve), but it has also been a lot of fun learning a coding language. Haha\u2026what I am really trying to say is that it does not look like I am going to be a developer anytime soon. How do you bridge that learning gap without slowing down your QA process? Let\u2019s welcome to Cypress Studio!\nBack in January, Cypress released a new feature called\u00A0Cypress Studio. With the help of a starter script, as shown below, you can start a screen recorder that will record your keystrokes and user movements around a site. Cypress Studio takes those recordings, converts them into Cypress commands, and places them right into your script. This has really helped me learn a variety of those commands that are useful for other scripts I am working on. Slowly but surely, I can start editing scripts on my own using the commands I have learned. The recorder also allows for a quicker turnaround time when getting an automated test up and running.\nThere is a little bit of learning involved with getting Cypress itself started up, but\u00A0Cypress Docs has some great documentation to help get you up and running. With Cypress and Cypress Studio running, you can run your startup script. Within the Cypress Test Runner, there is now a little magic button that allows you to start recording, as seen here. Follow the prompts and start recording your script.\nLet\u2019s say you have been hearing about how awesome this team at BizStream is, so let\u2019s check them out! Using that magical \u201CAdd Commands to Test\u201D button in Cypress Studio, here is a small script that would take you to the BizStream team page so you can check out the team. The generated code is even inserted with comments so that you know where the generated script has been added.\nWith some basic Cypress familiarity and the use of Cypress Studio, I was able to generate a reproducible automated script within minutes. With a script now in hand, you can easily go back to review and make sure items like your URLs and element selectors were recorded correctly. Additional assertions or commands can also now be added to your script and then simply just re-run it from there. Overall, Cypress Studio has proven to be a very useful tool in growing my Cypress skills over the past few months. Happy scripting, everyone!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

I\u2019ve scoured the web for various recipes, meat substitutes for my favorite dishes, and a replacement for what I miss the most\u2014Ice Cream. A friend of mine suggested a hometown creamery\u2019s dairy-free \u201Cice cream,\u201D and it didn\u2019t disappoint.\nEager to share my newfound love for this amazing plant-based creamy deliciousness, I looked up the flavor online, copied the URL, and pasted it into Facebook to start my post on how amazing it was\u2026\nWhat the heck was this? Facebook was grabbing the logo! I expected some great imagery of the product in all its non-dairy goodness. How could this be? This must be a mistake. After all, the page for the product has amazing imagery.\nHow could they not include a social image to showcase their product?\u00A0I\u2019m trying to give them free promotion to all my vegan friends after all! A brand with an amazing product has lost a chance at free promotion from one of their raving fans just because they didn\u2019t include a simple tag and image in their webpage code for their product.\nI found it interesting that they do use Open Graph images, but only on their blog articles.\nThere\u2019s that beautiful imagery I was looking for! Hudsonville Ice Cream even made a custom social image for their blog post to be sure it made an impact when shared. Why not put that same effort into their products?\nI don\u2019t want to pick on Hudsonville Ice Cream; after all, they have a fantastic plant-based product I love. They\u2019re not alone in missing out on social images for their products. After my experience with Hudsonville Ice Cream, I started paying attention to other brands and found many don\u2019t include a social image on their product pages.\nSharing the So Delicious product looks a little better than Hudsonville, but still, their product\u2019s image is cropped and really doesn\u2019t do their product justice. Again, So Delicious doesn\u2019t include specific images in their code for social sharing. They are relying on the social media platform to display an image from their product page, and in this case, their square product image has been cropped at the top and bottom.\nRelying on the social platform to select and display your product or content can be problematic, as shown in this example from a press release that was shared on LinkedIn.\nI\u2019m sure the headshot looked amazing, but because it is in portrait orientation on the page, LinkedIn grabbed it and cropped it to the center, cutting off the woman\u2019s eyes.\nAdding social images may seem like a lot of added work, but in reality, it\u2019s a way for you to control how your brand appears off-site. After all, you won\u2019t put out a print piece without having full control over how it appears, right? The same goes for social media. You have control over how your brand appears when users share your content. Make the most of it.\nOpen Graph tags are the easiest way to control how your content looks when shared on social platforms. Originally designed for Facebook, many social platforms, including LinkedIn, also use that tagging system to allow you to control both the copy and images displayed when someone shares your content.\nThere are a ton of articles on what\u00A0size image you should use for Open Graph and how to set up Open Graph\u00A0for your specific CMS/DXP. We\u2019re not going to get into those details. Instead, we\u2019re going to give you 4 steps on how we approach adding social sharing tags to our client\u2019s sites:\nAt BizStream, this is something we practice and encourage our clients to do as well. Every page on our website includes custom images and description tags for both Facebook (Open Graph) and Twitter.\nBy creating these custom tags for each page and adding custom imagery, it allows us to take control of our brand, make our content fun, and provides content that stands out when viewed on social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. Taking the added step of doing this for all our pages help us stand out from the competition\u2014if your competition isn\u2019t doing this, it can act as a differentiator for you and help you stand out from the crowd.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"389","pageTitle":"Design Like a Developer","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/design-like-a-developer/","text":"Design Like a Developer\n\u201CAnything is possible with code.\u201D This is a very common phrase thrown around when talking to clients or development teams about implementing features on a project. As I have transitioned from development into the design world, that phrase has quickly become \u201CAnything is possible with code, but only with a good design.\u201D As a web designer, it is important to bridge the gap between development and design through your work. Doing so allows for successful implementation, the ability to achieve realistic timelines, and ultimately, the delivery of a full-fledged, pixel-perfect web complaint site to your client. In order to achieve these project milestones, you must design with your developer in mind. Throughout my design process, I quickly found out that there are plenty of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts when it comes to creating something that can turn into clean and working code.\nI will be going over five basic design rules to follow to ensure that your work is always created with the developer in mind.\n1. Use The Grid. Consistent layouts are key to making sure your designs are perfectly implemented in code. The first steps in designing always start with determining your canvas, layout, and grid settings. Using the grid is crucial to allow for fluid and responsive design and is a big determining factor in how consistent your design project will be. What exactly is the grid? Is a twelve-column layout that has become standard in design due to its flexibility in dividing columns for responsive design. Most design tools have a grid layout system already baked in and are very easy to set up. When I use Sketch, I can set my grid for a workspace fairly easily.\nAn example of a common grid setup is shown here:\nOnce you define your grid for a project, be sure to note these specifications in a style guide that is provided to the development team. That way, they can easily translate any gutters, widths, or layouts in their code with any front-end framework that is built off of this same concept.\nI will be going over five basic design rules to follow to ensure that your work is always created with the developer in mind.\nConsistent layouts are key to making sure your designs are perfectly implemented in code.

That way, they can easily translate any gutters, widths, or layouts in their code with any front-end framework that is built off of this same concept.\nAccessibility awareness is on the rise, and if you are in any way involved in tech, there is no doubt that you have been part of a discussion involving web accessibility and ADA compliance recently. From seminars to certifications, it is becoming super important to make sure that designers and developers aren\u2019t only gaining knowledge of, but also creating their work based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). So why is this so important? As an engineer, you need to make sure that your product is accessible and has a consistent user experience for all of its users. The WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) states, \u201CMaking the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.\u201D TLDR; you want to make sure that the product you are creating doesn\u2019t get you sued.\nThese guidelines are a set of rules constructed to guide you to keep your site compliant, but this all starts with the design. A common issue I find when I am looking at certain designs or websites is regarding their color palette being used. One accessibility rule states your site must \u00A0\u2018ensure that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text\u2019. This seems simple enough but is often a common issue missed by many by the time it gets into the hands of the developer. Luckily, there are countless tools, both native and for download, to help guide you to make sure your site is compliant. One tool I commonly use to create my color palette for any project is WebAIM\u2019s color contrast checker. This is a simple tool to help make sure that you are creating web-compliant color pallets for your design style guides that are code-ready.\nAnother great tool is the\u00A0Cluse plugin for Sketch. This free-of-charge tool helps you test the contrast of various color layers within your project.\nAs a designer, it is hard to fight the urge to create the most extravagant deliverable with all the bells and whistles for the client. You want to deliver the next best thing; we all do. However, the design process is very similar to code. By following concepts of \u2018not reinventing the wheel\u2019 or the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), as a designer, you will natively start thinking in terms of code early on in the process. Know your audience you are designing for, and don\u2019t overcomplicate things.\nSetting a good foundation for a website through your design is crucial to allow for additional development to be implemented in the future. Your MVP design should consist of pages constructed by reusable components globally used throughout the project. Constantly ask yourself, \u2018Where can this design element or feature be reused?\u2019 Noting these consistencies in the documentation and style guide for the development team will be huge for consistency and estimating the project.\nComing from a development background, it is almost second nature for me to think, \u2018How can this be implemented in code?\u2019 when creating something. This isn\u2019t always the case for some designers. Luckily, there are tools out there to help you grasp development concepts and implement them into your designs. Webflow is a tool for designers to create fully functioning websites without touching any code. It is also a great way to design with front-end concepts in mind.\nThe dashboard is very CSS-focused and allows you to create your designs in a very code-oriented way.\nWebflow\u2019s design dashboard even gives you the ability to apply already existing styles through its \u2018selector\u2019 system which directly translates to CSS classes in HTML. Webflow is a great tool for any designer who is new to writing CSS and wants some knowledge of various CSS properties. W3Schools also has a great CSS Course if you want to learn some of Cascading Stylesheets\u2019 basics.\nBy now, you should be well acquainted with concepts of the grid, style guides, reusability in your designs, and so on. How can you make sure that all of these concepts are being implemented correctly in your design project? Trial and error, for one, but another important concept when it comes to working with a development team is collaboration. Whether it is through your deliverables or down to features to be implemented, any input from an outside-of-the-design team member will always be beneficial for your work.\nAt my previous employer, I was a front-end developer working with the design team, on the same floor, same row, sometimes even the same desk as me. There was a constant flow of communication when it came to their designs. \u2018How long would this variation take to develop over this one?\u2019 \u2018Is this even doable?\u2019 \u2018How would you approach this in your code?\u2019 were common questions early on in any project\u2019s design process coming from the designer. We were not siloed, and we were more often working together than not. This is why I feel like having an in-house design team is crucial to any development shop\u2019s success. Not just because it helps with keeping things internalized from a billing and estimating perspective, but because at the end of the day, teams are meant to work together in the same space to reach the same goal: create an awesome product for the client.\nTech is forever changing. Design is also forever changing. With new tools popping up every day to countless design systems to work with, it can be a bit overwhelming. Knowing how to work with your development team is key. Keeping collaboration, consistency, and web-accessible deliverables in mind, you will be successful in creating web-focused designs. If you are new to design like me, a graphic designer turned web, or even a complete career change into the design world, know that you will be on track to start designing like a developer in no time with these five steps.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

For some of us, it might not have hit us too hard; for others, it has been devastating. But, regardless of the magnitude, we have all been affected in one way or another. So here are a few ideas that may benefit you or even help you think of new ways to continue to tough it out through 2021.\nPersonally, I am very grateful that myself and my family have \u201Csurvived\u201D thus far with our health and jobs intact. Yet, there have been many disappointments and adjustments on the way, and they keep on coming.\u00A0Working from home and virtual school for my three children has often been quite a challenge. Being mostly \u201Choled up\u201D at home and not being able to see friends and family or even to go out often leads to feelings of loneliness. The most difficult thing for me, as a mom, is to have to sit my children down and tell them that one more thing they have been looking forward to has been canceled: another sports season, 4-h shows, church groups/activities, vacations, camps, and my daughter\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime East Coast Trip with her classmates.\nWith no real end in sight to the pandemic, it\u2019s easy to feel down, both physically and emotionally.\u00A0So I ask myself, \u201CWhat are some ways we have used or are using, both at work and at home, to help cope with some of the stress and issues that Covid has brought about?\u201D.\nHere are a few ideas that may be beneficial to you or even help you think of new ways yourself to continue to tough it out through 2021.\n1. Give yourself grace. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself (or your children). 2020 was a rough year, but you survived it. \u00A02021, you got it, no problem!\n2. Try to focus on the positives. Have you been able to spend more time with the family, less time commuting, lessen your commitments outside of work, focus more on your hobbies, or more time for self-care?\n3. Maintain your physical health. Exercise has always been a great way for me to blow off steam, and I feel a lot better afterward. Even if you can\u2019t go to a gym, there are many programs online you can do at home without any or little equipment. Challenge yourself. Get creative and get your family/friends involved.\n4. Get outside when you can and enjoy nature. Science shows that going outside has many benefits, including giving you more energy and mental focus.\n5. Connect virtually with people. Virtual hangouts can be a way to feel connected to your friends, family, and even co-workers. At BizStream, we have been doing virtual happy hours just to chill and catch up with our fellow team members. This past summer, we even held a socially distanced parking lot party just to be able to get together in person.\n6. Find creative ways to help or do something kind for someone else who is struggling. Send a card, bring a meal or care package, or call or text to let someone know you are thinking of them. Bringing joy to others often brings more joy to ourselves.\n7. Find substitutions. \u201CWe can\u2019t do/go ______, but we can do/go ______\u201D.\n8. Focus on things you CAN do. Play games, go to parks, go for walks, catch up on your favorite show or read that book you never seem to have time to finish.\nHang in there, and best wishes to you in 2021.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Once you have personas set up for your users, you can begin the process of customizing web page content.\nThrough the use of Page Builder, you can set up multiple variations based on your personas. As an important note, your development team must set up your widgets to support this personalization. Below you can see a basic call to action widget for a mythological productivity software:\nNow that I have my personas set up, I can modify the text, call to action, or image. To do so is simple. Simply hover over the widget and select the person icon:\nFrom the dropdown menu, select the \u201CIs in persona\u201D option to select from one of your personas that we setup.\nYou can be sure you\u2019ve done this correctly by checking to see that the single person has changed into a group\nYou can be sure you\u2019ve done this correctly by checking to see that the single person has changed into a group\nSelecting the group of people will show you all the variants you have created and allow you to change between them so you can modify your content.\nYou can target specific parts of the page and only create variants for sections that you think will matter for that specific persona.\nThe customization doesn\u2019t end with pages built with page builder. Let\u2019s assume someone filled out a form after buying our product. It makes sense to send an email tailored with their persona. This is where the marketing automation processes of Kentico can really shine. We can start with setting up a trigger within the marketing automation of a form fill:\nOnce we have the starting trigger setup, we can split out the path forward by using an if/else condition. The macro editor will allow us to easily select which persona or personas we want to split off, as well as sending a default email to anyone who doesn\u2019t have a persona yet.\nNow with a few simple conditions, our personas have been set up in the designer.\nWe can now take the next step and create emails for each persona. Using the Send Marketing Email action, you can specify which email or what drip feed you wish to send. If you don\u2019t have the emails already created, you can create them directly from the Marketing Automation!\nAfter we have all the steps defined, we can simply drag the pieces together in a nice flow, and we\u2019re ready to go!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

It helps you identify the right people to hire and justify firing the people who aren\u2019t a good fit. It helps you choose which projects to take on and which to let go of. And it gives your team a clear model to aspire to.\u00A0BizStream lives by seven Core Values, one of them being \u201CCare\u201D. The following is my interpretation of one of the ways it means to care at BizStream.\nThere are many ways to care at BizStream. Here is the \u201Cofficial\u201D list:\nThis blog post will focus on, \u201CCare about your work, the project being successful, the client being happy, and the team working well together.\u201D During my time working at BizStream as a web developer and leader, it has become easy to tell when a person has put careful thought into what they are delivering versus just getting a task off their plate as quickly as possible\u2014often making more work for others. Here are some things to consider before handing off your work.\nToo often, developers get caught up in deadlines and schedules, and the temptation to check in code that \u201Cprobably\u201D works is great. The problem is that making those assumptions, more often than not, leads to more work later because you have to get back in the headspace of the project and spin it all back up. It\u2019s better to be 100% sure it\u2019s ready now.\nWithin reason, of course. We\u2019re all human, and we all make mistakes.\nAnything that could be found, should have been tested for by you.\u00A0You know what your code does, you know what it interacts with, you spent time at the beginning identifying potential weaknesses and a test plan. There\u2019s no reason QA should find big obvious problems.\nAnything big that could be found, should be found in PR.\u00A0When you\u2019re putting your pull request together, feel free to point out any areas of your code that seem weak or you don\u2019t feel great about. This is the last opportunity to have someone else weigh in and help out.\nQA should be looking for edge cases and that your changes flow well with the rest of the app.\u00A0They should not be your last line of defense against 404 pages and buttons that aren\u2019t wired up. In the course of development, you should have been clicking everywhere and doing tests on the fly. You know that when you parsed that string, you need to check inputs that are too long or too short. You know that when you filter on a date range, you need to test dates and times right at the limits of the range to be sure you got your \u201C\u003C\u201D and \u201C\u003E=\u201D right. And if you don\u2019t know that, it will come with experience.\nTake\u00A0deliberate\u00A0time to review your work. A self-review of your work is a given. It\u2019s a part of development. Senior devs, how many times in all your years have you been in a hurry fixing a \u201Csimple\u201D bug, checked it in without testing, only to have it blow up for QA, and they send it right back to you because you spelled something wrong? Something that would have been obvious if you took the 5 seconds to pull up the UI and hit F5. Just one example, but there are so many places to take deliberate time to ensure success down the line.\nDon\u2019t do this:\nDo this:\nThere are hundreds of ways to show you care in any job on any project, and the effects of the caring you put out there can be felt throughout your team. Imagine being the QA person for someone who obviously never tests their own work and uses QA as a catch-all for their bugs. Resentment would, understandably, creep into that relationship quite quickly. These are just a few examples of how a developer can show they care on a daily basis, and how we at BizStream try to live up to our Core Values every day.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"393","pageTitle":"AQADGTPTOFVP","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-placing-trades-on-forex-com-via-python/","text":"A Quick and Dirty Guide to Placing Trades on Forex.com via Python\nFor anyone who has previously attempted to use Python to integrate with\u00A0Forex.com\u2019s API for algorithmic training and failed, I feel for you. Due to \u201Calright\u201D API documentation on Forex.com\u2019s end, and a lack of documentation on the\u00A0Lightstreamer side of things, it was no easy feat to get something working. With that being said, after going on a short hiatus of not working on this and then revisiting it with fresh eyes, I can finally utilize Forex.com\u2019s API and place trades via Python.\nForex.com is a foreign exchange broker. In layman\u2019s terms, they\u2019re a service that allows you to exchange currency for other currencies (like converting US dollars to Euros) on the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily volume of over 6 trillion dollars. For reference, the U.S. stock market sees about 90 billion dollars of daily volume. Due to this high level, there\u2019s a lot of liquidity in the forex market, making it a great candidate for algorithmic trading.\nBefore anything else, an account with Forex.com is needed, and thankfully they offer demo accounts, so you don\u2019t have to risk your actual money when you\u2019re getting your code setup and working.\nAs far as I know, the only way to gain API access for the created account is by contacting their support team and requesting API access. This process may have been improved since my experience, but I\u2019m sure this approach will still work even if there\u2019s an automated process now.\nThis is also the only way I\u2019m aware of to gain access to the API documentation, as I haven\u2019t been able to search for it using a search engine. Due to this, I will not be able to show screenshots or snippets from the documentation itself, but I will show my implementation.\nA session ID is needed for every request made to the API, so we need to get one before doing anything else. To do this, we\u2019ll need to make a POST request to the TradingAPI\u2019s session endpoint. The body of the POST will need to include our username, password, and app key. The username and password are the exact same as you would use to access the Forex.com WebTrader, and the app key is a value that gets provided to you when you set up API access to your live or demo account. Here\u2019s an example\u00A0get_session()\u00A0method\nNow that we have our session ID, we can now retrieve our Trading Account ID from the API. To do so, we need to make a request to the /useraccount/ClientAndTradingAccount endpoint. This call and all other requests require us to include authentication headers, which consist of your username and the session ID from the step above. Here\u2019s an example get_trading_account_id()\u00A0method\nNow we need to get some market IDs for the different markets we might want to trade in. For this example, I\u2019ll only be looking to place trades in the EUR/USD market. This is probably one of the simplest requests we\u2019ll make. The endpoint we need to hit is the /market/fullsearchwithtags endpoint, which takes in a query parameter that lets us pass in the market names we want information about. Here\u2019s an example\u00A0get_market_info()\u00A0method\nHere\u2019s where the meat and potatoes of this process come in. All previous and future steps involve us making requests to a HTTP service, but we need to interface with a streaming API to get current price data. In this case, Forex.com is using a library called Lightstreamer (https://lightstreamer.com) to stream data to clients. Unfortunately, there is no python client library straight from Lightstreamer. Fortunately, someone has made their own version for us to use. To use it, just run:\nNow that we have our Lightstreamer Client library, we need to build the connection and subscribe to the correct data stream. First things first, we need to create a LightstreamerClient object. This takes in our username, session ID, API Url, and something named an\u00A0adapter_set. In this instance, the\u00A0adapter_set\u00A0is\u00A0STREAMINGALL.\nNext up is creating our LightstreamerSubscription object. This is what determines what information we get back in the stream response. This object takes 4 parameters: mode, adapter, items, and fields. Below is a quick description of each.\nHere\u2019s an example of all these fields broken out using methods we previously created.\nNow that we have a subscription object, we need to provide a method to add as an event listener. In this case, we\u2019ll make a method called\u00A0on_item_update(update_item)\u00A0which takes in an object that has all the fields we requested as part of the subscription object setup. Below is a sample event listener method that simply prints out the fields we wanted. For your own usage, you would want to save these in some way to be used later on. We\u2019ll also include the call that adds the method as an event listener.\nAll that\u2019s left now is connecting to the server side of Lightstreamer, and connecting the subscription to that connection. After making these two calls, we\u2019ll start getting updates every time the streaming API pushes our new values. Here\u2019s how to do that\nAs you can see, when subscribing, we get a key value. This can be used at a later time to kill the connection like so\nWe finally have all the information we need to place a trade. To do so, we need to construct a JSON object that contains information about the trade we want to place. For this object, we\u2019ll need data from a few different things. First, we need the Audit ID and either the Bid or Offer price from the streaming API (the price used is based on if this is a buy or sell operation). We will also need the market ID of what market we want to trade in, as well as your Trading Account ID from earlier. In this example, I\u2019m requesting a static quantity of 10,000, but this could also be easily made into a variable that can be modified for each request. The same goes for the PriceTolerance value, which determines how much slippage in price you\u2019re willing to allow. Here\u2019s the full example\u00A0place_trade()\u00A0method\nCalling this method should successfully place a trade using your account.\nIf you\u2019ve followed this full post, you should have everything you need to start placing trades in the market. Obviously, there\u2019s plenty of space to improve, like putting this all in a class or a couple of different classes so you can have variables always at your disposal for things like your session ID, streaming data values, and anything else you might need. The goal of this post was to give some simple copy-paste lines of code that can be used together to get you up and running as fast as possible.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"402","pageTitle":"DPTEYKXS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/defining-personas-to-enhance-your-kentico-xperience-site/","text":"Defining Personas to Enhance Your Kentico Xperience Site\nDo you know what an individual or group of users is doing on your\u00A0Kentico Xperience website? Google Analytics can provide a high-level overview of what is being viewed but isn\u2019t great at tracking at a macro level. As a trusted website and application consultant, BizStream leads many conversations about delivering tailored user experiences to various website visitors. In this post, I\u2019ll break out some of our common advice and share how Kentico Xperience can logically do segmentation of groups based on the rules you define.\nWhen we start on the user journey with our clients, we commonly discuss two items for each page of their site: What is the goal of a page, and what types of people visit the said page? This often creates a matrix, as different people visit pages for different reasons. For today\u2019s example, I\u2019ve generalized a page from one of our e-commerce clients working in manufacturing. They have three types of people that typically interact with their category landing pages:\nThe above process of designating groups of people within a website is often called building Personas. As a best practice, we usually suggest people identify between two and five personas at the start of their project. You\u2019ll want these personas to be as unique from each other as they can be. You can get into the further refinement of personas once you have a baseline. For instance, maybe there is a persona for super-engaged designers that is based on the number of times they attend events associated with the brand. This is a good segmentation point but is usually overkill for the start of the project.\nThe more you know about someone, the more likely you can tailor their experience into something that will resonate with them in a meaningful way. This personalization leads to a happier user experience, which, in our experience, results in hitting our key website performance goals. Now that we have some idea of the personas we want, we can create them in Kentico and set up the automation of users into personas.\nOne quick note, personas, and other digital marketing tools, are provided as part of the Xperience Enterprise licensing. If you have just the business license, you can upgrade (We can assist with this process; just\u00A0contact us) to access all the marketing features.\nOnce you have logged in to the Kentico Administrator site (Also known as the Kentico Mother), you can access the personas application by selecting the icon in the top left corner or by pressing \u2018F2\u2019 and then typing in personas. From there, you can select the\u00A0add a new persona\u00A0button.\nHere we can enter the Persona name, add an image if want, and, most importantly, talk a little about why they will be placed into this persona. This helps us as we begin making rules about adding points for different activities on the site.\nOnce that information is set up, we\u2019ll begin associating site activity or information we know about the user to add to the persona point score. This scoring system allows you to further refine how a user ends up in a specific group.\nPersonas logic would say that a user is in at most one persona at a time, so we really want to key in on what specific activities indicate they are in specific groups. Kentico tracks in three primary categories:\nWhile each of the above options has its use cases, we often find site activity tracking to be of extreme importance to building a good persona. As such, we often encourage a minimum of three activity-based rules for each persona.\nYou can see all these various options by selecting the rules menu item and selecting the green New rule button.\nIn the persona design phase, we often encourage our clients to just start adding rules and then figure out the thresholds of points for each attribute or activity after they do some live testing. For Marty\u2019s example, our client added a rule for if visited the gallery pages, product detail pages, and a large number of points if they filled out a form requesting a design consultation.\nNow that we have some rules set up, Kentico will do its best to track both logged-in and anonymous users and will even merge some information together if a user starts anonymous and then changes to a logged-in user, placing them into proper personas. Better than generic page view data, having an idea of how many people are fitting into each persona is vital in planning out marketing automation.\nThat\u2019s all you need to know to get some personas set up in Kentico. Next, we\u2019ll look at\u00A0elevating an individual persona\u2019s experience with your website by personalizing content on pages just for them.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"404","pageTitle":"IPTAS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/iis-performance-tips-and-scripts/","text":"IIS Performance Tips and Scripts\nLately, I\u2019ve been trying to improve the performance of our web server, which runs IIS 10.0 on a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine. We host over 150 application pools that run many of our internal sites and tools, as well as some of our multi-tenant applications. In this article, I\u2019ll give a few tips on how I was able to reduce the server\u2019s memory footprint by 50% and improve the responsiveness of our sites.\nIIS configuration can be a bit confusing. There is a hierarchy of configuration files that handle various settings, and it can be tough to memorize which settings are located in each one. To break it down:\nLuckily Microsoft has a handy PowerShell module available for IIS 8 and above to help manage all these settings. I will demonstrate using the IISAdministration module. You can verify it is installed with this snippet:\nBy default, your IIS site is not actually loaded and running until the first request is served. This means that your site can be slow to load initially. There are a few different strategies you can employ to mitigate this, but I chose to have our sites ready and running at all times. To do this, I will be setting some properties in the applicationHost.config file using PowerShell.\nI first need to make sure I have the IISAdministration module loaded and get a reference to the IIS Server Manager:\nNext, I iterate through all of the sites and set the properties I want:\nNow our applicationHost.config file will be updated with the above values, and our sites and application pools will automatically startup with the server. Our sites will be speedy and have no delay when the first request comes in, but now it seems we have another problem. With all of these sites always running, it looks like the server\u2019s memory is filling up fast! What do we do?\nBy default, IIS will configure application pools as 64-bit when the operating system supports it, and this can be a problem for site performance and server memory usage.It turns out that Microsoft recommends setting your application pools to 32-bit unless you have a specific 64-bit dependency, and it has been the recommendation since 2007! It seems this advice continues into .NET Core as well. From the article:\nOne of the performance benefits of the x64 platform is that it increases virtual address space, making more memory available. We recommend that you configure IIS to use a 32-bit worker processes on 64-bit Windows. Not only is compatibility better than the native 64-bit, performance and memory consumption are also better.\nTo do this, we have to set the enable32BitAppOnWin64=\u201Dtrue\u201D attribute on our application pools. We can do this in the same PowerShell snippet above by adding this line below the other application pool configuration changes:\nHowever, since we probably want this setting to apply to all of our application pools and all the ones we make in the future, we should set this on the \u003CapplicationPoolDefaults\u003E node in applicationHost.config. To do this with PowerShell, we can add this to our snippet before we call CommitChanges():\nAfter the changes are committed, our node will be updated like this:\nNote that we could also set the\u00A0StartMode\u00A0and\u00A0AutoStart\u00A0properties on the ApplicationPoolDefaults as well.\nIn our situation, our server was consistently utilizing around 80% memory, according to Task Manager. After setting the application pool defaults to enable 32-bit, that utilization IMMEDIATELY dropped to 40%. Quite a difference!\nI hope this article was able to help you improve your site performance with IIS, or share some ideas for utilizing PowerShell for site configuration. The IISAdministration\u00A0module is very powerful and can be used to manage all of your site settings well beyond what I\u2019ve covered here. Please see the\u00A0documentation\u00A0for additional details.\nAdditional references:\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

Once this is done, it\u2019s just a one-click deploy from your repository to your production site. This can be somewhat involved, and probably takes an hour to do.\nBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll try to make it easy.\n1. To start creating your release pipeline, go back to dev.azure.com/teamname, click on your projects, then go to Pipelines -\u003E Releases.\n2. Under New, click on New release pipeline\nThis will give you a blank template of what you want your release to look like. You should be seeing something like this.\nIt\u2019s going to open up a menu on the right-hand side of the screen that looks like this\n3. Just click on Empty job\n4. If you\u2019ve already created a build pipeline, you can add the output of that build as an artifact. Just click on the plus button next to Add an artifact.\n5. Fill in the information that relates to the Pipeline that you set up earlier, and click Add.\n6. Click on the Stage and name it by what you are deploying to (a Raspberry Pi) .\n1. Under Pipelines, click on Deployment groups.\n2. Then click on New under Deployment groups.\n3. Name the group something you\u2019ll remember\n4. Hit Create\n5. In the Type of target to register, Select Linux\n6. Make sure you select the box Use personal access token in the script for authentication.\n7.\u00A0Click on Copy script to the clipboard\nYou will need to change this script. The default script includes a full-blown x64 Linux script, you don\u2019t want that; you need the script that does arm.\n8. In the script you copied, replace the part of the script where you find this\u00A0with this.\nNote that the only difference here is the fact that I replaced x64 with arm, so if you are on a newer version, just test the link in the browser to see if it works for the download.\nTake this script, and copy it into a terminal window in the Raspberry Pi, and run it in your home directory (you can get there by typing in cd ~)\nAlso, it\u2019s going to ask you to Enter deployment group tags for agent; press y for yes. Put in a description of the raspberry pi (for me, I put in something like Pi4 Deploy)\nIf you have to re-run this, then go into your home directory and type rm -r azagent first to get rid of any installs.\n9. Once this is done, you can go look at your deployment group in Azure and see if it\u2019s online or not.\nThere\u2019s no need to create a service; the script you ran did that all for you! All that\u2019s left is to finish configuring your release pipeline and run it.\n1. Go to Pipelines -\u003E Releases, click on the Release you made earlier, and click Edit\n2. Go to Tasks and click on the default task that was created with your pipeline.\n3. Create a deployment group job. This creates a context that all of the releases run.\n4. In the Deployment group, select the group as the one that you created in the previous steps. Your build artifact is automatically selected for you.\n5. We don\u2019t need the agent job, so click on Agent Job and then click Remove. After that, click on Save to save your current progress on the release pipeline.\nThe Release Pipeline is now going to run in the context of all of the agents inside of the deployment group. Now we can start telling it to do things.\n1. Copy your files from the Artifact to a working directory.\nTake note of the Source folder, this has your project folder that it saves your zip file to; you will need that later.\n2. Stop the kestrel service\n3. Stop nginx from serving your site\nAll the other steps involve creating bash scripts as you did in the last step, so just keep creating them with the following settings\n4. Delete your current website\n5. Unzip your artifact to your website directory\n6. Start NginX again\n7. Start the kestrel service that hosts dotnet\n8. After this, your release pipeline should look like this\n9. Save your Pipeline\n10. Go ahead at test it out by clicking Create release\n11. You can manually create your release from the Pipeline. Later you can set it up to trigger on certain conditions (like if you push to the Master branch of your repo). Click on Create\n12. After the Release is created, you need to trigger it. If you go to Pipelines-\u003E Releases and click on your pipeline, you should see your first release, go ahead and click on it.\n13. This will bring you back into the pipeline and show you where this Release needs to be triggered. Click on the Deploy button after hovering over the stage to trigger the release.\n14. While you triggered the deployment, you should see the task turn to In Progress. To view more information, just click the link\n15.\u00A0It tells you what the status of the task is. To view the steps/scripts that it\u2019s currently running, click the graph.\n16. In order to get the details, you may have to refresh this page\nThis is really handy for troubleshooting any errors that may have happened during your build. It tells you what the status is on each step of the process.\nThat\u2019s it!\nIt\u2019s a long process to get here, but once you are here, it\u2019s easy to automate builds. You can set up your releases to trigger on a push to the master branch and set up new environments on other pis (Like if you are hosting a local web app). Now all of your deployments are done by a push of a button instead of manually compiling a list of changes to push when you update your code.\nBe sure to check out the whole Raspberry Pi series:\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

If all you need is a dev site or something local that you want to tinker with, then a Raspberry Pi works just fine. In my case, I know this is only a local website. Also, there is only me and maybe one other person that will be able to access it. It\u2019s also really good for creating an app with familiar web programming languages.

There are no security concerns that I addressed here either, so you may have to customize what I did to enable that.\n3. This will direct you to the navigation page.

This makes it so that you can do all of your development on a windows environment (or any environment, or from multiple environments) and deploy seamlessly with a click of a button to a Raspberry Pi. Bad news, it\u2019s not very easy to figure out how to set it up initially. As far as I know, there isn\u2019t a good tutorial on how to do this. So, here it goes.\n1. Get a website working. I\u2019m using a .NET Core app with REACT.\n2. Get an account on Azure DevOps \u2013 \u00A0I will admit, this is the only thing that I never actually did myself. I used an existing account to do this.\n3. Have a repository where you store your .NET Core solution.\n1. Go to dev.azure.com/azureaccount\n2. In the top right corner, click on New Project\n3. Fill out your project name and description and click Create\nIt will give you quite a few options on the side. You really aren\u2019t interested in any of them except pipelines for this tutorial.\nIf you are unfamiliar with pipelines, then know that there are two main kinds of pipelines: build and release.\nThe build pipeline tells Azure where to go to build something. So in my case, I\u2019m getting my code repo from git and building it on my Raspberry Pi. This creates a build artifact. Once you have a build artifact, you can publish/deploy it using the second main kind of pipeline \u2013 the release pipeline.\nThe release pipeline takes your build and publishes it to wherever you want it published to. In my case, I\u2019m taking my build artifact from my Raspberry Pi and then publishing it to the web directory on the same Raspberry Pi.\nSo with our next steps, we need to set up a build pipeline and a release pipeline. The release pipeline will be covered in the next blog post.\nYou can have Azure spin up its own server for you to build stuff for every time you run the build Pipeline. It\u2019s probably easier than doing what I\u2019m about to show you. However, I didn\u2019t want to incur any charges to the account I was using, so I needed to build on my own equipment. If you have a default account, you can use the Azure (I think it\u2019s just the default one) agent pool with enough free build minutes that you probably won\u2019t have to worry about the cost. If that\u2019s the case, you can just skip down to where we set up the release Pipelines. It won\u2019t make me sad because I don\u2019t actually know you\u2019re reading this in the first place.\n1. Before you can create the agent, you need to create a personal access token so that your Pi can authenticate with Azure. To do this, click on the little user Icon next to your user badge in the top right. Then click on Profile.\n2. Click on New Token, Then fill out the agent according to what\u2019s on the screenshot (Your organization name is specific to your organization) and name it whatever you want. Then click Create.\n3.\u00A0Copy your Personal Access token. You will use it later when configuring your Raspberry Pi.\n4.\u00A0Agent Pools are not on a project level. They are an organizational thing, that way, if you have a build server, you can have a bunch of different projects use the same build server whenever you need it. So, go to your home page at dev.azure.com/azureaccount.\n5. In the bottom left-hand corner, click on Organizational Settings\n6. Go to Pipelines -\u003E Agent pools\n7. Click Add pool and add a name/description and submit\n8. Now, you need to access azure from your Raspberry Pi. So, log in to your Raspberry Pi, and navigate to the Agent pool you just created\n9.\u00A0Now Click on Agents and click on New Agent\n10.\u00A0Select Linux and then ARM. Then click the Download button to download the agent\n11. Then you want to run the commands listed from a terminal window on your raspberry pi.\nmkdir myagent \u0026\u0026 cd myagenttar zxvf ~/Downloads/vsts-agent-linux-arm-2.166.3.tar.gz./config.sh\nWhen you run this command, it\u2019s going to ask you some questions\n12. To see if the agent is online, go to dev.azure.com/organization -\u003E Organization Settings (in the bottom left)\nClick on the Agents tab to see if your agent is running. If it isn\u2019t, then go to your terminal window where you installed it (in the case of this tutorial, it was installed at ~/myagent), run the command ./run.sh and it should soon enable your agent. If it still doesn\u2019t work, you may have to recreate the build agent, or reboot the raspberry pi and try again.\n1. Go to Pipelines on the side navigation menu, then click on New Pipeline in the top right of the screen.\n2. There are two different ways that you can do an Azure Pipeline. YAML, or the Microsoft designer. Ideally, YAML gives you more control, but I chose the Microsoft designer way since it\u2019s easier to start with. I also found YAML to be really boring. So, in my case, I had a Git repo on the very same Azure Account, but I chose Other Git for this so I could get the Microsoft designer features for the Pipeline. Note that you can switch to YAML if you want to later. However, if you choose any of the options tagged YAML, you can\u2019t get any Microsoft designer features.\n3. Now, you can select your Azure Git Repo here; just give it the information you need (If you are using another repository, select something else). Click Continue.\n4. Next is your basic templates. Since this tutorial is running with a .NET Core application, I\u2019d suggest selecting that just to get you started.\n5. This gets you set up with a basic starter pipeline. There is one thing I recommend changing about the default, and it\u2019s on the publish step. So click on the Publish step, and add -r linux-arm into the Arguments text box.\nThe Artifact staging directory doesn\u2019t matter all that much because you are grabbing from that same directory in the release pipeline that we will be setting up later.\n6. Click on Save (Not save and queue as we aren\u2019t fully set up yet).\nNow that the Pi is set up as an agent, it\u2019s time to finish the pipeline build.\n1. Click on your Pipeline, and select the Agent Pool that you made earlier.\n2. Click Queue to run the Pipeline.\n3. To see if your Pipeline is running, go back over to your Raspberry Pi and look at the agent that you started when you typed in /run.sh, it should look like this\n4.\u00A0 You can also view the status of the build by clicking on the running job in the Pipeline.\n5. Now, if you\u2019re me, you ran into this issue:\nThis means that you need to install node and npm. To do this, visit and follow the instructions on the npm site on your Raspberry Pi.\nNote that on these instructions, it\u2019s going to have you run a command tar gzipped file. I\u2019ve found that this doesn\u2019t work, and you may have to open up your file explorer, right-click on the downloaded file, and click on extract here for the step. Other than that, it will work just fine.\n6. Queue the build again in Azure DevOps, and see what happens.\n7. Note that with your first publish/build, it may take some time for it to gather all of the resources it needs (for me, it took about 8 minutes to build on the Raspberry Pi 4).\nYou still aren\u2019t done. Why?\nWell, what happens when your Pi reboots? You have to manually run the ./run.sh and dotnet command to spin up your solution. So, we need to create services to automatically restart those things when your Pi restarts; here\u2019s how to do that.\n1. Create a Service for your dotnet app (and replace any appname texts with your app name)\n[Unit]Description=ASP.NET Core 3.1 App \u2013 App Name\n[Service]WorkingDirectory=/var/www/appnameExecStart=/home/pi/dotnet/dotnet /var/www/appname/appname.dllRestart=always# Restart service after 10 seconds if the dotnet service crashes:RestartSec=10KillSignal=SIGINTSyslogIdentifier=dotnet-appnameUser=piEnvironment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=ProductionEnvironment=DOTNET_PRINT_TELEMETRY_MESSAGE=false\n[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target\nsudo systemctl enable appName-kestrel.service\nsudo systemctl start appName-kestrel.service\nFor me, I got a problem that happened where it kept on trying to run the site under https. I didn\u2019t really want this to happen as I didn\u2019t have https configured, so I went into my .net core Startup.cs and commented out this line, \u200B// app.UseHttpsRedirection();\nThen I re-ran the build and copied it back to my web directory again.\nAfter this, it should automatically start your web site even if your Pi has to reboot. There. One less thing to worry about.\n2. The build service \u2013 this is a bit easier to do, just go to the directory you installed it on and run these commands (cd ~/myagent)\nsudo ./svc.sh installsudo ./svc.sh start\n3. You can then verify that it\u2019s working by going to the Agent in Azure DevOps, it should say Online.\nThere. Phew. That was a long process to get the build server up and running. The next step is to set up your Pi release Pipeline. That way, your build can actually run as a website there. It\u2019s kind of an involved process by itself\u2026that\u2019s why it\u2019s in my other blog post.\nBe sure to check out the whole Raspberry Pi series:\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

It\u2019s ok; things will get better. After you do what I say, that is. Don\u2019t feel bad if your Raspberry Pi doesn\u2019t work right away, I had to troubleshoot about four or five times before I learned my lessons.\nI\u2019ve found that it usually boils down to something not loading correctly on the SD card. The problem I ran into when this happened was that I wasn\u2019t sure if the Pi just didn\u2019t like my monitor or if it really wasn\u2019t working. It turns out there\u2019s a way to find out!\nSee the little lights on the side of the Pi?\nIf only one of them is on and the other one never blinks, that means your Raspberry Pi isn\u2019t starting up. Something is probably wrong with your SD card. Here\u2019s how you can fix that.\nIf you are setting up the Raspberry Pi for the first time, I recommend doing this anyway.\n1. Put the SD card into your computer. When you do this, you\u2019ll probably get this warning.\u00A0Just dismiss it, and if a dialog box opens, simply exit out of it.\n2. Hit the Windows key and type in Disk Management.\u00A0Click on Create and format hard disk partitions.\n3. Make sure that you look at the disk that\u2019s in your drive. If you get the wrong one, you could erase your own hard drive and anything that\u2019s on your computer. I did this. It was very embarrassing, but mostly because I told everyone.\nI\u2019m using an 8 GB chip, so I know that it\u2019s this disk.\n4.\u00A0For each of the Partitions in that disk, right-click and select Delete Volume\u2026 I can\u2019t stress enough to make sure that you are deleting it under the correct disk.\n5.\u00A0After you are done, it should look like this.\n6.\u00A0Take out the SD card and put it back into your computer. You can try to open it, but it will error out. This is because it\u2019s completely clean, and it doesn\u2019t even know where to store things. That\u2019s good because it\u2019s the right state to run the installer in.\nOnce this is done, you\u2019ll want to set up your Pi again.

{"id":"410","pageTitle":"HTSUARPIGS","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-getting-started/","text":"How to Set up a Raspberry Pi I: Getting Started\nIn the world of the Internet of things (IoT), the most versatile thing is a full-blown computer. Most people (including myself) are too cheap for that, so the makers of Raspberry Pi decided to make a cheap computer that almost anyone can afford. Setting it up isn\u2019t as easy as a normal computer. There are plenty of Raspberry Pi setup tutorials out there (I will be sending you to some of them), but few of them, in my opinion, will set you up from start to finish with a working computer.\nNot only this, but if you are a web developer like me, you\u2019ll want to host your own websites with this! This is one of many tutorials on setting up a web server on the Pi using the fun .NET Core. You don\u2019t have to learn the less fun PHP that Linux likes so much.\nAlso, if you have no idea how Linux does all the things, I\u2019m hoping this will get you through without having to know any Linux things that do stuff. Sure, you\u2019ll have to open up a scary terminal window a couple of times, but I\u2019ll walk you through it.\nFirst, I like to be very obvious. You need a Raspberry Pi. But which one? There\u2019s like a zillion of them!\nOk \u2026 more like 9. Anyways, it depends on what you want to do. If you\u2019re just starting and you want to do things with a computer with the least amount of setup, go with the 3B\u002B (it\u2019s a little cheaper). Otherwise, go with the 4. This tutorial will cover either of those.\nWhen you want to figure out how much it costs, keep in mind it\u2019s more than just the Pi. You\u2019ll need some other components as well.\nAny HDMI monitor will do, although I\u2019ve had issues with some off-brand monitors not liking the Pi for some reason. I used a 4K 52\u201D TV. It looked amazing in all of its tiny HD pixels.\nMost of the USB keyboard/mice out there will do. I recommend one that lights up because it looks cool and makes you look like a pro.\nYou\u2019ll need these things only for setup, so if they are hooked up to a computer you already own, you can use those, and I\u2019ll show you how to remotely access it from another computer.\nDisclaimer: Technically, don\u2019t NEED any of these. There\u2019s a way to set it up without it. However, I\u2019ve tried it that way\u2026over and over again with no success with different Pis and versions of its Operating system. If you like to experience repeated failure at a higher rate than I could tolerate, then I suggest not getting a keyboard/mouse/monitor.\nIf you have a Pi 4. You need a USB-C charger (or the charger to your phone if it was built in the last couple of years)\nIf you have a Pi 3B\u002B. You need a plain old mini-USB charger.\nI wouldn\u2019t use anything less than 16GB \u2013 I tried an 8 (they said you can do that), and I quickly ran out of space with the libraries I was using. Most of these come with an adapter.\nBut WHY?\nA Raspberry Pi is not like other computers. It boots off of this one mini-SD card. Get one. It will not run without it. I\u2019ve also found that if you buy a kit to set up your Raspberry Pi with stuff already set up for you on it, it may not actually work. You\u2019ll have to wipe it if that\u2019s the case.\nLike the one in the screenshot above, you can also use one of those flash Drive -\u003E SD card adapters.\nYou\u2019ll need a WiFi network to download all of the updates you need.\nYou also need a plain old HDMI cable to hook the Pi up to a monitor.\nNotes:\nAfter you get all that stuff, here\u2019s how to set it up.\nYou need to get the latest Operating System installed on the Pi. The Pi most commonly runs on Debian (Also known as Raspbian, and it has a bunch of different versions). That\u2019s the OS I\u2019ll walk you through here.\nFun fact: each version of Debian is named after a Toy Story character.\nIf you have a Pi3, you can\u2019t use the latest version of Debian, you need to use the Stretch version of Debian (Some random octopus character from Toy Story 3). For the Pi 4, you want to run the Buster version of Debian (the puppy from Toy Story 2).\n1. Insert your SD Card, then open up your file explorer, and it will show up on the left.\nYours might show up as the letter D as I have more than one drive on my PC.\nYou can download the imager for your little SD card by going here; it\u2019s the first link on the page. Note that you might not be able to access it. That\u2019s because you might not even have a partition on your SD card, and that\u2019s ok; just keep going.\n2. Install the program from downloads. Once it finishes, it will open the program.\n3. You want to select the first option (Raspbian) for this tutorial.\u00A0(I\u2019m not sure all of the limitations on this, but I do know that I\u2019m running a web server with .NET Core/REACT and a build/release agent on it, so regular Raspbian (a version of Debian) can handle all that).\n4. When you select the SD Card, remember that drive letter from step 3? Select that drive.\n5. Then click on Write \u2013 note that this can take a little bit \u2013 I have a fairly fast laptop, and it took me 5-10 minutes to complete.\n6. After this is done, take out your SD card and put the mini-SD into the little slot at the bottom of the Raspberry Pi.\n7. When you\u2019re done, the setup instructions on the pi will help you connect to a network and change your password.\n8. After that\u2019s done to make sure you have the latest version of whatever version of Debian (If you got Buster, it would give you the latest and greatest Buster, if you go with Stretch, the latest and greatest Stretch). To do this, you have to open up the scary Terminal window.\nNext, run these commands to start the upgrade process:\nsudo apt updatesudo apt full-upgrade\nThese commands could take a while. So go get a sandwich. Then type in the following command:\nsudo reboot\nWhen you run this, your Pi will restart, so don\u2019t freak out when everything goes black.\n9. Congratulations, you did something. Your computer works.\nThese things are all well and good, but what if something doesn\u2019t go right? I had a bad SD Card, my monitor wasn\u2019t working, and the installation didn\u2019t work the first time. If this sounds like something that happened to you see, keep an eye out for part 3 of this series, where I give a tutorial on how to wipe an SD Card.\nAlso, If you aren\u2019t burnt out on setting up your Raspberry Pi, you can set up a remote desktop. This lets you log in to your Pi if it\u2019s on the same network as your computer. It will display a screen of your Raspberry Pi that you can do whatever you want in without actually having to run a dedicated monitor/keyboard/mouse. That way, you can just be cheap and use them for setting up the Raspberry Pi and use the other stuff on a computer you actually care about. If that\u2019s something you want to set up, go here. It\u2019s probably the best tutorial that I\u2019ve found.\nBe sure to check out the whole Raspberry Pi series:\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

I love working with .Net Core and Kontent, so this series will focus on giving you the tools you need to create awesome products. We\u2019ll start at the place where all successful projects should begin from a development perspective: with a look at what type of architecture is going to position us for success based on the project\u2019s technical requirements.\nArchitecting your solutions properly is important. In Robert C Martin\u2019s Clean Architecture, he states the goal of software architecture is \u201Cto minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system\u201D. Trying to make changes to a project that has bad architecture is a bit like gluing together your legos: worked great the first time you did it but is a real headache if you need to make any changes! \uD83D\uDE2C\nIf you\u2019re like me, there\u2019s always THAT PROJECT that you dread making changes to because changing one thing is like pulling out a bottom piece on a teetering Jenga tower, one wrong move and everything comes crashing down.\nNow imagine your boss saying there\u2019s a critical feature malfunctioning in THAT PROJECT and YOU need to fix it right away before the company bleeds too much money! \uD83D\uDE35\nEager to solve the critical problem, you rip open the codebase, take one look at the code, and the nightmares of the last time you had to change something in this project come rushing back.\nYou psych yourself up, thinking \u201CI can do this!\u201D Remembering the Jenga tower you formulate a plan of attack, in and out with lightning speed, fixing the issue quickly and efficiently with no casualties. Here\u2019s your plan for the change:\nBut as soon as one unforeseen force hits you, everything crumbles around you and it ends up being more like this:\nThis is what bad architecture can do to your project, it can cripple it making the easiest changes difficult and risky.\nIn this post, we\u2019ll review the architecture of a production .Net Core 3.1 MVC website with a Kontent.ai headless CMS. We\u2019ll review a SOLID architecture that\u2019s easy to scale and maintain. We\u2019ll cover which projects you\u2019ll want to add, what each project does, and why each project is important.\nNormally we\u2019d look at the project requirements and goals first, evaluating which technologies would be good fits for the requirements. For the purpose of this article, we\u2019ll assume the technology requirements are already chosen.\nThe goal of this architecture is to segregate the Kentico dependencies in a repository layer so the remainder of the project has no dependencies on Kentico, the external API doubling as our data layer.\nSean Wright outlines a similar architecture for Kentico 12 MVC, N-Tier Architecture \u2013 Layers as Abstractions, in his excellent blog post, Kentico 12: Design Patterns Part 20 \u2013 Choosing a Solution Architecture.\nI love all of the examples you can find online. Reading other peoples\u2019 articles and reviewing other projects on open source platforms like GitHub has really taught me a lot about what good software architecture looks like. A great example, complete with automated tests, is the Kontent.ai Boilerplate repo for ASP.NET Core MVC. Like most projects online, for simplicity, their HomeController performs all of the logic: it queries the database, creates objects, and returns the object mashed together with the view back to the browsers.\nAlthough great, for example, projects, this can break things like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) or the Open Closed Principle. Joe does a great job of explaining why query logic (or any logic) in your controllers could be troublesome in his blog post, Visualizing Thin ASP.Net Controllers via SOLID Principles. Basically, there can be more than one reason for this code to change; you can\u2019t test the controller or logic in isolation, it can lead to god methods, and the query isn\u2019t reusable.\nKentico has done a great job and giving you all the tools you need to query their headless CMS, Kontent, including the heavy hitter, IDeliveryClient. This interface alone will give you enough power to do nearly everything you need to do to get data from Kontent. \uD83D\uDCAA\nIn order to call Kentico\u2019s DeliveryClient from your controller, you need to install the Kontent Delivery SDK. Since this is functioning as our data access layer, we are going to create a Kontent. Repository layer that will have all of the dependencies needed to interact with the Kontent API map the results to domain objects and return them without any references to Kentico to the UI layer. Whenever you have an external API, you should consider an abstraction like this around the code with tight coupling to the API. This allows you to only change your repository layer when those external dependencies inevitably change, rather than changing every layer of your project. The UI layer shouldn\u2019t care if the database layer changes underneath it!\nThe Common Reuse Principle states\nDon\u2019t force users of a component (dll in our case) to depend on things they don\u2019t need.\nI don\u2019t want to have to install the entire Kontent Delivery SDK in every piece of my project!\nYou can see here that the Web, Infrastructure and Repository projects depend on Core, but do not depend on each other. We\u2019ll use the D of SOLID, Dependency Inversion Principle, to inject the concrete classes the Web, Infrastructure, and Repository layers need without adding dependencies to those projects by putting only the interfaces in core! \uD83E\uDD20\nThe most important rule of the Dependency Inversion Principle is:\nDon\u2019t refer to volatile concrete classes. Refer to abstract interfaces instead. This rule applies in all languages, whether statically or dynamically typed.\nIf you use a new keyword, chances are you\u2019re probably violating this principle.\nThere are two ways data can flow through the layers of this application. For Create/Update/Read/Delete (CRUD) pass through style calls, the UI layer calls an IRepository interface directly (green arrows). If our application has additional business logic that\u2019s required, like an EmailService, we implement that business logic in our Infrastructure project. In these cases, the web layer calls an IService that resides in the Infrastructure project, which then can call IRepository data access layer if it needs to (blue arrows).\nAlthough this project doesn\u2019t have a traditional database, this architecture also works well for applications that do!\nThis project is the .Net Core 3.1 web application.\u00A0It contains\nThis project is also responsible for the dependency injection container configuration. However, I would consider moving this logic into a Mapping or Bootstrap layer because it requires references to all concrete classes in order to tell the application how to resolve the interfaces. Here\u2019s a snippet of the code required to setup dependency injection for Kontent\u2019s IDeliveryClient. IDeliveryClient, CachedDeliveryClient, ProjectOptions, DeliveryOptions, ITypeProvider are all from Kentico and therefore require a Kentico dependency.\nThis project is the business logic layer that contains concrete implementations of services.\nThis layer should not depend on the Web or Repository layers. It can call the repository layers via IRepositories that are injected into it.\nThis project is a repository layer for Kontent. The purpose of this project is to abstract Kentico API calls and models into its own layer for use throughout the application.\nThis layer enables a software system to interact with external systems by receiving, storing, and providing data when requested.\nThe output of this layer are Core models designed with Domain Driven Design in mind, with no references to Kentico.\nIf you have additional data sources, add another repository layer. When we wanted to add Azure Search to our project, we created a Demo.Search.Repository. If a service needs information from both, call both repository layers and consolidate the result in a core model and return the core model to the Web layer.\nThis project is the core layer where the domain models or core models live. It also houses all interfaces for the project.\nThe purpose of this project is to hold all of the automapping profiles, so the application knows how to map Kontent models to core models. We also started to migrate some of the dependency injection registration here but did not complete it.\nIn Part 2, we\u2019ll look at the code associated with this architecture and trace a request from a controller down into the repository layer and back up to the UI. \uD83D\uDE4C\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

We\u2019d then use Automapper to map the Kontent class to a clean core model based on Domain Driven Design, returning the core model to our UI layer.\nIf we needed additional business logic, we had an Infrastructure layer for any services like Email or Recaptcha.\nIn this segment, we\u2019ll take a peek at what the code looks like to accomplish this. Let\u2019s dive in!\nThe HomeController lives in the Web project. Notice there is very little logic in the controller. It does 3 things: call the homePageRepository interface, return a NotFound 404 if no home page domain models were returned from the repository and return the view with the homePage domain model.\nAfter some debate, we chose to send core models out to the view layer rather than create a bunch of additional ViewModels in the Web layer to save on development time and mapping logic. \u00A0Our core models were simple, so we were ok with this. \u00A0When a view needs more than one model, we created a wrapper core model. \u00A0Each View displays core models.\nHere\u2019s some of that Dependency Inversion Principle at work, IHomepageRepository is injected, so the controller has dependencies on the interfaces in core instead of the class in the repository layer.\nIn your startup.cs or your bootstrapper project, you can setup auto registration so any interface with the same name as a concrete class will automatically get configured. You can also see the Automapper config below.\nStartup.cs\nBoostrapper\nAll interfaces live in Core.\nAnd its concrete implementation lives in Demo.KenticoKontent.Repository\nAs long as the Homepage is already defined in Kontent, you can use the Kentico model generator to generate a C# class that the SDK will automatically serialize the JSON response from the API into. It looks something like this and lives in the repository layer. We decided to put this in the repository layer because it\u2019s tightly coupled to the Kontent API call, and it has Kentico SDK dependencies.\nThe Kentico dependencies are almost hidden here. \uD83E\uDDD0 Asset and ContentItemSystemAttributes are both classes provided by the Kontent SDK.\nThe domain model we created to return this data to the UI is Homepage.cs and it lives in the Core project under the Models namespace.\nThe mapping logic lives in Demo.Mapping\nNow you have a good idea of how to setup dependency injection to upload the Dependency Inversion Principle and how to segregate your code in the appropriate layers to enable easy maintenance in the future! \uD83D\uDE3B\nIn Part 3, we\u2019ll look at how we can architect Kontent\u2019s linked items to have our codebase automatically generate URLs and route to them based on what type of content is linked.\nBe sure to check out the whole .Net Core 3.1 with Kontent.ai Series:\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"413","pageTitle":"IEFQPWD","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/improve-entity-framework-query-performance-with-dapper/","text":"Improve Entity Framework Query Performance With Dapper\nEntity Framework\u00A0is one of the most popular ORM frameworks in the .NET world, and for good reason. It\u2019s generally quick and easy to get started doing basic CRUD operations, performance is acceptable for most use cases, and at version 6.3 for the full .NET Framework, it is very mature and stable. However, for more complex queries, it is common to run into some performance issues.In this blog post, I will detail the steps I took to reduce the time to complete a query using Entity Framework, and then ultimately how I used another .NET ORM framework called Dapper to further increase query performance.\nRecently I worked on a project for users to track hundreds of data points about their clients, and then create complex reports using that data. Clients would have demographic information such as age, gender, household type, and others spread across normalized database tables. They would also have multiple \u201Cassessment\u201D collections tied to them, where users would input data about their clients\u2019 health, income, and other factors.The model would look something like this:\n\u2026only with many more assessment types (each of which contained their own nested object properties).Since most of the reports the users needed to generate would reference all the various assessments and other nested objects within the Client, I decided the best way to handle this would be to query the database once and populate all these nested properties, then pass this collection to the report service where the calculations are performed.This looked something like this:\n\u2026only with many more. Include() statements added.When Entity Framework builds this query, it will use SQL \u201CJOIN\u201Ds to get the one-to-one mappings such as \u201CHouseholdType\u201D. However, when it gets the collections, it will perform a \u201CUNION ALL\u201D across all the assessments and their various properties. Depending on how many collections you need to include and how many properties/nested objects they contain, this can create one huge ugly query that is not very performant. With hundreds of clients containing dozens of assessments, this query would take a few minutes to complete in our testing.\nThe first thing I tried to remedy this issue was to drop the .Include() statements for the nested collections, and instead loop through the clients and manually call \u201CLoad\u201D on them.That looked like this:\nThis method will make a call to the database for each collection. In our testing, it did shave about 30 seconds off the total query time, but that wasn\u2019t quite enough for my liking. I had heard of the performance benefits of Dapper, so at this point, I had decided to give it a try.\nWith Dapper, you write the SQL query yourself and write code to tell it how to map the results of your query to your models. To do this with collections, I used the QueryMultiple extension, as shown below:\nTo my surprise, loading my nested objects this way reduced our total query time from 2-3 minutes down to 6 seconds!As you can see, it is easy to include Dapper alongside an existing Entity Framework project. All I had to do was install the Dapper NuGet package and then add \u201Cusing Dapper;\u201D to my namespace imports at the beginning of my code.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"414","pageTitle":"CBWAT","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/cache-busting-with-aspnetcore-taghelpers/","text":"Cache Busting with AspNetCore TagHelpers\nCaching of client-side files is a functionality that, when properly implemented, can greatly improve the load speed and perceived responsiveness of your web application for end-users. In this blog post, I\u2019ll go over enabling the Cache-Control header for static files. I\u2019ll also show you how to implement an ASP.NET Core Tag Helper that can be used to fingerprint static file URLs to enable browser cache-busting when those files change on the server.\nTo cache static files in .NET Core, the Cache-Control HTTP header must set in response to a request for a file. This is done by configuring a StaticFileOptions object and passing it to the UseStaticFiles( IApplicationBuilder app, StaticFileOptions options ) override within your startup file:\nMore information on how the Static Files middleware functions can be found on ms-docs.\nThis would reduce requests needed for a browser to load a page if a static file had been requested on a previous navigation. However, if that file changes on the server, the browser won\u2019t redownload it until a year after the first time it downloaded it (MaxAge). For the file caching to be effective, we need the means to force the browser to re-download a cached file if it has changed on the server. This is typically done via fingerprinting: adding a unique value to the URL requested by the browser based on the requested file.\nWhen using a build tool like webpack, we can configure the tool to fingerprint (append a unique hash) to the file name at build time. This is great for SPAs but extremely cumbersome for Mvc applications, where a developer would need to continually update a script tag to point to the correct version of a file.\n\u201CWhat if the script element could update itself?\u201D\nThis is where Tag Helpers come into play. Tag Helpers are similar to MVC \u00A0HTML Helpers but in a syntax that blurs the lines between HTML, Razor, and C#. They enable an MVC developer to customize/override the rendering of HTML elements and/or element attributes.\nUsing the HtmlTargetElementAttribute, we can define a Tag Helper that targets img, link, and script elements, in order to define a custom cache-* attribute, which will result in the attribute\u2019s value (a URL to a file) to be fingerprinted:\nThe first step in implementing this Tag Helper is to define a method that can be used for generating the fingerprint (file hash) that will be used to make the URL to the file unique. In ASP.NET Core, file system access has been abstracted through File Providers and the common IFileProvider interface. The Static File middleware uses this abstraction to locate static files and write them to responses. We\u2019ll also use this abstraction to locate static files in order to create a unique hash of them using the IFileProvider.GetFileInfo( string ) method. This method returns an IFileInfo object and is the type upon which we\u2019ll define a generic extension method for generating a file hash using a specified HashAlgorithm:\nNow that we have a generic method that can be used to generate a file hash or fingerprint, our next step is to define the Tag Helper that will replace the usage of cache-* attributes on img, link, and script elements with the proper attributes for those elements.\nWith the code there to swap out the usage of a cache-href/cache-src attribute with href/src attributes, we can now implement the code that will retrieve an IFileInfo object and generate the fingerprinted URL. Due to some static files being quite large, such as images, we will update our Tag Helper with a dependency on ASP.NET\u2019s IDistributedCache abstraction so that we can cache the file\u2019s hash. This will prevent the app from performing expensive reads \u002B computations required to calculate the hash on every request.\nIDistributedCache is used to handle scaling (load balancing). For a more straightforward implementation, you may consider using the IMemoryCache abstraction.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"415","pageTitle":"ACED","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/angular-click-elsewhere-directive/","text":"Angular Click Elsewhere Directive\nHave you ever needed a custom drop down menu where it\u2019s dropdown state could be toggled based on click events? Maybe you\u2019ve already developed a working solution using native DOM functionality or a library such as jQuery. If not, no problem!Our goal is to write some code that will allow us to execute a callback function when we click \u201Celsewhere\u201D or outside of a target element\u2019s descendant elements. We want our functionality to be reusable amongst multiple target elements such as custom dropdown menus. Oh, and we\u2019re using Angular 4.In summary, we want to use an Attribute Directive on our target element that sets up a Host Listener that listens for a click Mouse Event on the Document and emits the Mouse Event if the element being clicked is not a descendant of our target element. Our template containing the target element will bind a callback function to this mouse event and close the dropdown menu.That was a bit of a mouthful. Let\u2019s break it down.\nWhat is an\u00A0Attribute Directive? According to the official Angular docs at the time of this writing,\u00A0Attribute Directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.So, like the definition states, we will be changing the behavior of our target element. We want our target element to emit an event when there is a mouse click outside of any of its descendant elements. Let\u2019s take a look at our directive definition before we add any functionality to it.\nUsing the\u00A0@Directive\u00A0decorator we can decorate a class as an Angular Directive. Notice the\u00A0selector\u00A0value: \u2018[clickElsewhere]\u2019. Since we want to be able to use this directive as an attribute on our target element, we are using square brackets which will select the attribute named \u2018clickElsewhere\u2019.We also inject a reference to the target element that this directive is attached to using\u00A0ElementRef. The reference to the target element is possible via the normal Angular dependency injection pipeline.\nLet\u2019s add a few more things to our directive:\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve imported a few more things from the @angular/core package that we need to complete this implementation:\u00A0EventEmitter,\u00A0HostListener\u00A0and\u00A0Output.We\u2019ve created a property called\u00A0clickElsewhere\u00A0and decorated it with the\u00A0@Output() decorator to let Angular know this is an output property. This property is an\u00A0EventEmitter\u00A0and based on its type parameter:\u00A0MouseEvent, it will emit mouse events. Event Emitters allow us to emit events up to our containing components. Notice the name of the output property we\u2019ve created has the exact same as the selector for our directive:\u00A0clickElsewhere. This allows us to use a very concise syntax when using this directive in a template, which we will see later.Finally, we\u2019ve defined an\u00A0onDocumentClick\u00A0function and decorated it with the\u00A0@HostListener\u00A0decorator. The Host Listener allow us to listen to an event on the host \u2013 which is the target element that this directive will be attached to. The first parameter of the @HostListener decorator is the event name. The second parameter is an array of arguments that are emitted in the event. Since we want to listen to click events on the whole document and not just the directive\u2019s host, we went a step further and added document as our target before the click event name: document:click.The @HostListener decorator also passes the arguments, $event in our case, into the function it\u2019s decorating. So, our function will have one parameter: event, which will be of type MouseEvent.Our function is pretty simple, it checks to see if the element being clicked on is NOT contained within the element that our directive is attached to. If the user clicked elsewhere or outside of the element that our directive is attached to, then we emit the mouse event as an output. To achieve this, we are taking advantage of the\u00A0EventEmitter\u00A0to emit the mouse event as our Output property.\nNow that we have our directive setup we are ready to use it in a template. We would like to bind a callback function to the event that gets emitted\u2013when the user clicks outside of the element we are attaching our directive to. I\u2019ve set up a simple example that calls an\u00A0openDropdown()\u00A0function when the user clicks on a target div. When the user clicks elsewhere, a\u00A0closeDropdown()\u00A0function is called.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that! You can see the concise syntax that I mentioned earlier:(clickElsewhere)=\u201DcloseDropdown()\u201D. We are doing two things at once here. The first thing we\u2019re doing is adding an attribute to the div called\u00A0clickElsewhere\u00A0which allows angular to find our directive by a selector:\u00A0@Directive({ selector: \u2018[clickElsewhere]\u2019 }). The second thing we\u2019re doing is binding the\u00A0closeDropdown()\u00A0callback function to the @Output() property in our directive that is also called\u00A0clickElsewhere. Since the directive\u2019s selector and output property both share the same name we are able to do this with a nice short syntax.If our directive\u2019s selector and output property had different names, we would have to declare the selector attribute on the target element, and bind to the output property separately. So, if we were to rename the output property to\u00A0clickOff, we would have to use the directive like this:\nIf you are writing a directive where you plan to have multiple output events that you\u2019d like to bind to, then the second syntax is going to be required. If you are writing a simple directive that does one thing, like we are in this example, you can leverage this concise syntax and have the template be a bit more readable.I hope by taking the time to read through this example, you learned something new about the Angular pipeline!\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"416","pageTitle":"YFDOTJAB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/your-first-day-on-the-job-at-bizstream/","text":"Your First Day on the Job at BizStream\nI don\u2019t know about you but I have had some less than stellar first days on the job, where the day is full of paperwork and downtime sitting around waiting on managers or others to \u201Cget around to me.\u201D It sort of makes sense right? You\u2019re new, you don\u2019t really understand the nuances of the company, your position, or even the technology you\u2019re using. I wonder if it\u2019s just a foregone conclusion that your day is just going to be that, paperwork and sitting around? But does it have to be that way?\nI have also started my first day with less than stellar equipment, few or no accounts or nothing at all, just a blank desk. At some point in the day someone will walk by and say, \u201COh I guess we need to get you some things.\u201D I have been at companies that view this as some odd right of passage, or I am told, \u201Cit\u2019s just the way it is.\u201D Why is that? I am sure in most instances it was not intentional, but sometimes managers are just so relieved to find someone to fill the position they forget about how it feels to be the \u201Cn00b\u201D on your first day. BizStream, being a small company, has run into some of these same challenges, so we started an \u201COnboarding\u201D team to alleviate or lessen some of these issues and make the first day a better experience for everyone.\nYou only get one first day, you only get one first impression: why not make it as awesome as possible?\nJust like the potential team member wants to make a good impression during their interview, wouldn\u2019t you want to show off your best as a department, team, or company? After all, you spent a lot of time and effort to find that right person to help backfill, maintain, or take your company to the next level. Why would you want them to question if they made the right move?\nWhen I started at BizStream I noticed that we were not consistent on how new team members were brought in. Now, to the leadership\u2019s credit, I was greatly impressed that they had thought it out and had a roughed out task list. The issue was it was not formalized or inclusive enough to make things consistent even though it far exceeded some other companies I had worked for. I have had good success in previous roles with bringing people in, so I wrote up a quick one page outline and shared it with a few people internally. This led to a larger discussion and our Onboarding team was formed.\nAs a team we talked about what needed to happen, at minimum, on a team member\u2019s first day. We talked about the good and bad of our first days at other companies and we developed what is now our standard Onboarding schedule.\nOur team decided that we wanted, at minimum, the first day completely scheduled out for the new team member. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t any downtime, but it is minimal. If you know BizStream, you know we are not into a formal, corporate, schedule your every waking moment kind of thing, but we made an exception here to help facilitate a lasting first impression.\nWe started by reviewing who needed to be involved in bringing on a new team member. Our current team looks like this: Office Manager, HR, Building Manager, Project Manager, IT. Each one of these team members has a vital role in \u201Conboarding\u201D a new team member. Each time we bring on a new team member we meet as a team with the hiring manager and someone from our Leadership Team to ensure that we understand all the expectations that were laid out during the hiring process, review any specific details, and set the schedule for the team member\u2019s first day. This way everyone is on the same page and no one is blindsided on the day of. This is typically not a long meeting, typically only taking 30 minutes or less.\nOverview: Below is a sample document that is printed out and left on the new team member\u2019s desk as well as emailed to the hiring manager and the Onboarding team. This ensures that at any point during the day, anyone of these people can help the new team member through their day. The actual first day agenda document will have photos of the team members that the new hire is scheduled to meet with. I have found this to be exceptionally helpful as new team members are bombarded with data the whole day. It\u2019s nice to be able to put a face with a name and if you need to find someone, to know what they look like.\nFirst off, you will notice that we ask our new team member to start their first day at 9. You are asking yourself why do you give them a free hour on their first day? Typically most of our new team members start on a Monday. How many times have you walked into the office after a weekend and you have nothing but fires to put out? What if you were caught in traffic, or your kid spills milk all over you just as you\u2019re about to leave? My experience is that new team members will try and show up early on their first day, now you as a manager, are already stressed due to the above or any other myriad of reasons. By having them start at 9 this helps not transfer that stress to the new team member and allows the manager to give them their full attention.\nWe will get into gear and accounts a little later, but with most people they like their desk a certain way, they like specific items on their desktop or want to import their browser favorites. This is a great time for them to do that and make their workspace their own and of course, to grab a cup of coffee.\nWe have a fantastic and unique office, and our team members really like it. We typically show people around when we interview, but we want the new team member to be familiar with where things are. They are going to be here eight or more hours a day, it\u2019s nice not to have to hunt for things or ask every time, \u201Cwhere is that conference room?\u201D Our office manager, Michelle, takes the new team member around and shows off our uniqueness, and the nuances of our office.\nEvery Monday we have a company meeting in which we discuss personal highlights in our \u201CList of Awesome\u201D as well as what business is upcoming for the week or month, what is new in the sales cycle, what things are being rolled out, marketing, events and a check-in to see if anyone has too much or not enough work. This is a great and relaxed time in which we all introduce ourselves to the new team member and where the new team member can get a 30,000 foot view of what our company is doing.\nYou can\u2019t get around it, so it\u2019s here. Amanda, our HR manager and Bookkeeper is great and keeps things as light and painless as filling out the handbook, insurance, and W4s can be!\nWhat better way to bring on a new team member than to take them out to lunch on the company their first day? We are a team and a family at BizStream so we try and get to know our new team members on multiple levels. Lunch usually includes the hiring manager, one of both of the owners, and some or all of the team the new team member will be working with. Again, we are family so lunch includes lots of razzing and laughter about whatever is on our plates that week.\nOur building manager also happens to be in charge of Quality Assurance (QA). Josh\u00A0will review how to access the building, reemphasize where some key things are, and then discuss how our QA team handles projects.\nThat\u2019s me, Blair. I like to discuss the software and hardware we use. Where to find things on our corporate file share, how to access our development servers, and how to access our VPN. This can sometimes get bogged down in a lot of technical stuff so I push to keep it light and short unless there are specific questions.\nMike, our Operations Lead, will take the new team member through our typical project process, walk them through our project management software, and show them how and where to track their work time. Every company does project management differently and each project manager leads projects a little differently. We find it helpful to be upfront as possible on how this works at BizStream in order to ease the new team member into our processes and reduce confusion.\nWe primarily use a Content Management System (CMS) named Kentico\u00A0for most of the websites our team builds. BizStream has it\u2019s own standards on how to implement Kentico and it\u2019s code, so the rest of the day is dedicated to working through these standards and getting used to Kentico.\nThe Friday afternoon of the new team member\u2019s first week we schedule a social hour. This is a time for everyone to grab a featured drink, chosen by the new team member, get to know the new team member, and relax as a team.\nBizStream is obviously a tech company and we love our tech! As a new full time team member you get a laptop with the same specs as every other developer. You don\u2019t get a hand me down because the IT guy wanted a new machine, you get a clean machine that is not more than a year old, and is packed with the same amount of power as anyone else in the company. We give you at least three 24\u2033 screens connected to a dock, so taking your laptop to and from meetings is as painless as possible.\nAs a perk, you get to select the keyboard and mouse that you want to work with. It\u2019s just another way that BizStream allows you to customize your workspace to fit your individual taste. The desk is full of BizStream goodies when you arrive. Our swag stock changes from time to time but a new team members can expect things like coffee mugs, travel mugs, sunglasses, pens, notepads, bottle openers and the like.\nWe strive to have all of the necessary accounts built for the new team member before they arrive. We use lots of software in our jobs, both in-house and in the cloud. I do my best to configure all those sign-ons to connect to one of two authentication platforms so when a new team member starts, they don\u2019t have a sheet of 20 different passwords to commit to memory. If I did my job right, it\u2019s one, sometimes two passwords, connected to a single sign-on (SSO) store.\nWe want to know what works, what didn\u2019t, or what could be tweaked to make the experience for the next new team member that much better. About 30 days after the first day, we send out a quick survey that asks questions about your first day and first week on the job. We keep it short and light but we really do desire the feedback to make sure we are on the right track. The Onboarding team reviews each survey and makes improvements as necessary.\nBizStream does not have all the right answers. Our team meets regularly to discuss what works what doesn\u2019t. We have gone through several iterations to get the process to where it is now. Not all things described here will work for all companies, but I think it\u2019s a good starting point to evaluate if you could be doing a better job as a team, department or company.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

If you change your database structure and remove a field or two then refresh your model, chances are those fields are still going to be hanging around in your models causing confusion. You\u2019re going to need to do the wizard\u2019s job and remove those fields for good.Using the instructions above, open up your EDMX as XML. Search the text for the name of the field you changed/removed. It will appear 4-5 times if it\u2019s a normal field, and considerably more if it\u2019s any kind of primary/foreign key. Go through all instances and modify the XML to your liking for each. In the case of removing a field, you\u2019ll just remove all traces of that field the EDMX file.\nAs you probably know, every time you hit save while looking at the EDMX diagram, Visual Studio spins for a couple seconds. It\u2019s actually looking at the XML we just talked about and deciding whether it needs to change any of your generated classes as a result. It doesn\u2019t always do the best job of changing existing classes. Sometimes you might have done something to confuse it and it doesn\u2019t update the classes as you\u2019d expect. For instance, take removing or renaming a field from your database as an example. You don\u2019t want to modify those generated classes, because at some point you\u2019ll regenerate them and all your changes will be overwritten. You might just want to have VS start over and try again from scratch.To do this, find the\u00A0[YourDatabase].tt\u00A0file (not to be confused with the [YourDatabase].Context.tt file), and expand the cs files below it. You\u2019ll see one file for each database table you\u2019ve imported. Highlight all of the files and delete them all. Trust me, it will be ok. Once deleted, right-click on the [YourDatabase].tt file and select\u00A0Run Custom Tool. Give it a few seconds to think and all your classes will be regenerated again.\nVisual Studio\u2019s default EDMX process is great, but it can\u2019t foresee every nuance of every custom database. One example is multiple relationships to the same table. For instance, in my legacy application I sometimes have tables with multiple relationships back to the user table. (A table with fields like CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy, SubmittedBy, etc.) The generated class will contain objects like User, User1, User2, etc. Not really helpful when you\u2019re using those classes in code. You can do a few things to make your generated classes more helpful. Let\u2019s dive into the T4 templates.Open the [YourDatabase].tt (T4 Template) file. This contains the template used to generate all the classes for your database tables. In it, you\u2019ll see each part of a class file with other methods and properties sprinkled in. You can do a ton of cool things inside this file to help make your generated classes easier to use. I\u2019m going to show you one of these neat tricks.Search the file for\u00A0\u201Cforeach (var navigationProperty in navigationProperties)\u201D. This is going to loop through all the relationships (navigation properties) in the class it\u2019s working on. A little farther down you\u2019ll see\u00A0\u003C#=codeStringGenerator.NavigationProperty(navigationProperty)#\u003E. This is going to output the property text, think public User User3 { get; set; }. Right above that line we\u2019re going to add:\nThis is going to add a summary block above each navigation property including the relationship name (foreign key name). This summary block is included in the intellisense displayed when you hover over the relationship while typing out code. If you have your foreign keys named decently, you can use this to help you figure out which User (User, User1, User2, User3, etc) is CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy, SubmittedBy, etc.\nTo summarize, Visual Studio makes working with Entity Framework pretty easy but it still has a way to go. Hopefully this post will help make up for a few of the places it falls short.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"418","pageTitle":"BizStream Goes Solar","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/bizstream-goes-solar/","text":"BizStream Goes Solar\nSometime last month, BizStream went dark, and we couldn\u2019t have been more excited because the darkness came as our newly installed solar panels were being hooked up!\nGoing solar has been a goal of BizStream\u2019s for a while now. As a tech company, we love the idea of leaning into this new(ish) technology. But, beyond the techy, fun stuff, we had many other reasons for harnessing solar power.\nAnother deciding factor in our decision to go solar is based on our Founder\u2019s personal experience, Mark Schmidt. Mark went solar at his home in 2019 after seeing the benefits his parents experienced once they made the switch. Noting the affordability and the collective energy output throughout all the seasons in Michigan, Mark was confident that solar was a great way to reach BizStream\u2019s goal of becoming a more environmentally friendly company.\nI\u0027ve always been interested in alternative energy (solar, wind, water, movement, etc.). I\u0027ve done small personal solar/battery projects at home on my gazebo, so I could listen to music and run a ceiling fan out there. I\u0027ve always wanted to do it on my house and business, but financially, it never made sense due to the cost of batteries. However, once I realized there was 1-to-1 net metering available, it became an option to explore. We are pretty much using the utility company as the battery. We generate power for the utility company, and they credit us. They supply us with electricity, but it is 100% paid for by the credits. This works great because we over-produce in the summer and under-produce in the winter. It all balances out with the credits.\nActually, yeah! While The Mitten only comes in 35th on the 2021 sunniest states list, and we only get an average of 170 sunny days per year, there are plenty of reasons to soak up the sun\u2019s energy here.\nOur team started planning for this project back in 2019. With the guidance of Tiger Solar, BizStream landed on 224 solar modules. The system is expected to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce 88,977kW annually.\nCheck out the final installation with\u00A0Tiger Solar\u2019s drone footage.\nThere are many factors to keep in mind when considering moving to solar energy. The incentives and grant opportunities seem to be forever changing, and of course, they will depend on your location. Tiger Solar did a lot of the leg work when it came to finding the best grants to apply for, navigating the latest laws and regulations, and working with the utility company to get everything squared away. If you\u2019re located in Virginia, Idaho, Maryland, DC, or Michigan, we highly recommend consulting with them. If you\u2019re located in a different state, we\u2019d suggest finding a reputable company that will advocate for you and help you navigate your project.\nOur ultimate goal is to get entirely off the grid, allowing us to avoid blackouts during storms, downtime during maintenance work, etc. However, it financially doesn\u2019t make sense for BizStream to do so at this time due to the high costs of batteries. Advancements in traditional battery technology have been slow-moving up until the last few decades. In the past few years, though, scientists worldwide continue to look into many alternative battery technologies, even one\u2019s that harness plant waste energy! That seems promising, right?! Either way, we\u2019re keeping an eye on battery advancements and hope to utilize them when the time and technology are right for us.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

I have no idea why, but SvcUtil.exe is too stupid to be able to figure out relative links on your local filesystem. Take heart, however, there are a few different ways to let SvcUtil know about your XML schema.\nGo through each and every imported WSDL and XSD file, making a list of all the full paths to each imported file. As you probably know, since you\u2019ve Googled this far, this can be super annoying and time-consuming when you have a large XML schema.\nWrite a little utility app to do the heavy lifting for you. Recursively parse the text of each file, storing the full path and finding more files to parse. This is ok, but it just forces you to write and maintain more code.\nWhile SvcUtil.exe can\u2019t seem to figure out relative links on your local filesystem, it seems to have no problem when your schema is hosted. A quick and easy way to take advantage of this is to create a local IIS website with your schema as the Physical Path. Then, when you pass your WSDL to SvcUtil, you use the URL instead. Bingo, all your relatively linked XSD files are picked up and your service is created!Using the easy way, your\u00A0SvcUtil.exe\u00A0command goes from this:\nto this:\nAs you can see it is a lot nicer only having to worry about loading in your resources from the URL-based version.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nI joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn\u2019t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.\nThat same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.\nI went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).\nI was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.\nI like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.\nWe have a group of like-minded people here. There\u2019s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I\u2019m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it.\u00A0When people think it can\u2019t be done, we\u2019ve done it.\nI love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It\u2019s what I\u2019d do even if BizStream didn\u2019t exist. What we do at BizStream isn\u2019t easy, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u00A0It\u2019s challenging, sure, but I couldn\u2019t be in a job that wasn\u2019t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.\nIt also makes me happy that we\u2019ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the\u00A0BizStream Academy\u00A0\u2014 a program where we offer development training for students \u2014 and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.\nI work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work,\u00A0which is one of the great things about BizStream \u2014 the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I\u2019m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.\nWhen I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),\u00A0 and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy.\u00A0I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico\u2019s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world.\u00A0When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.\nAs a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don\u2019t care that it\u2019s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn\u2019t realize it, but I was learning what \u201Cwhatever it takes\u201D really means.\nI was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I\u2019ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I\u2019m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I\u2019ve never met a Roulette table I didn\u2019t like.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.

{"id":"452","pageTitle":"Mark Schmidt","url":"https://bizstream.com/about/mark-schmidt","text":"Mark Schmidt\nOur motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.\nThe first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that\u2019s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU\u2019s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I\u2019d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.\nAfter GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.\nWith a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That\u2019s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don\u2019t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That\u2019s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.\nAt BizStream, we\u2019ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it\u2019s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be clich\u00E9, but it\u2019s true \u2014 we work hard and we play hard.\nI\u2019ve found that if you\u2019re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people\u2019s shoes, and I\u2019m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don\u2019t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don\u2019t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren\u2019t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.\nThe reason BizStream\u2019s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn\u2019t want to work at a typical job. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let\u2019s make it something we want to do.\nThis mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We\u2019ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).\nIn addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College\u2019s computer sciences department. It\u2019s really cool because I\u2019m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.\nWhen I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I\u2019m not at work, I\u2019m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I\u2019ve done a lot of home automation, and I\u2019m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.\nWork is such a big part of most everyone\u2019s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.\nThere\u2019s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: \u201CChoose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.\u201D That\u2019s where it\u2019s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren\u2019t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people. Have a project you\u2019d like to collaborate on?

{"id":"459","pageTitle":"YFDOTJAB","url":"https://bizstream.com/blog/june-2017/your-first-day-on-the-job-at-bizstream","text":"Your First Day on the Job at BizStream\nI don\u2019t know about you but I have had some less than stellar first days on the job, where the day is full of paperwork and downtime sitting around waiting on managers or others to \u201Cget around to me.\u201D It sort of makes sense right? You\u2019re new, you don\u2019t really understand the nuances of the company, your position, or even the technology you\u2019re using. I wonder if it\u2019s just a foregone conclusion that your day is just going to be that, paperwork and sitting around? But does it have to be that way?\nI have also started my first day with less than stellar equipment, few or no accounts or nothing at all, just a blank desk. At some point in the day someone will walk by and say, \u201COh I guess we need to get you some things.\u201D I have been at companies that view this as some odd right of passage, or I am told, \u201Cit\u2019s just the way it is.\u201D Why is that? I am sure in most instances it was not intentional, but sometimes managers are just so relieved to find someone to fill the position they forget about how it feels to be the \u201Cn00b\u201D on your first day. BizStream, being a small company, has run into some of these same challenges, so we started an \u201COnboarding\u201D team to alleviate or lessen some of these issues and make the first day a better experience for everyone.\nYou only get one first day, you only get one first impression: why not make it as awesome as possible?\nJust like the potential team member wants to make a good impression during their interview, wouldn\u2019t you want to show off your best as a department, team, or company? After all, you spent a lot of time and effort to find that right person to help backfill, maintain, or take your company to the next level. Why would you want them to question if they made the right move?\nWhen I started at BizStream I noticed that we were not consistent on how new team members were brought in. Now, to the leadership\u2019s credit, I was greatly impressed that they had thought it out and had a roughed out task list. The issue was it was not formalized or inclusive enough to make things consistent even though it far exceeded some other companies I had worked for. I have had good success in previous roles with bringing people in, so I wrote up a quick one page outline and shared it with a few people internally. This led to a larger discussion and our Onboarding team was formed.\nAs a team we talked about what needed to happen, at minimum, on a team member\u2019s first day. We talked about the good and bad of our first days at other companies and we developed what is now our standard Onboarding schedule.\nOur team decided that we wanted, at minimum, the first day completely scheduled out for the new team member. Now, this doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t any downtime, but it is minimal. If you know BizStream, you know we are not into a formal, corporate, schedule your every waking moment kind of thing, but we made an exception here to help facilitate a lasting first impression.\nWe started by reviewing who needed to be involved in bringing on a new team member. Our current team looks like this: Office Manager, HR, Building Manager, Project Manager, IT. Each one of these team members has a vital role in \u201Conboarding\u201D a new team member. Each time we bring on a new team member we meet as a team with the hiring manager and someone from our Leadership Team to ensure that we understand all the expectations that were laid out during the hiring process, review any specific details, and set the schedule for the team member\u2019s first day. This way everyone is on the same page and no one is blindsided on the day of. This is typically not a long meeting, typically only taking 30 minutes or less.\nOverview: Below is a sample document that is printed out and left on the new team member\u2019s desk as well as emailed to the hiring manager and the Onboarding team. This ensures that at any point during the day, anyone of these people can help the new team member through their day. The actual first day agenda document will have photos of the team members that the new hire is scheduled to meet with. I have found this to be exceptionally helpful as new team members are bombarded with data the whole day. It\u2019s nice to be able to put a face with a name and if you need to find someone, to know what they look like.\nFirst off, you will notice that we ask our new team member to start their first day at 9. You are asking yourself why do you give them a free hour on their first day? Typically most of our new team members start on a Monday. How many times have you walked into the office after a weekend and you have nothing but fires to put out? What if you were caught in traffic, or your kid spills milk all over you just as you\u2019re about to leave? My experience is that new team members will try and show up early on their first day, now you as a manager, are already stressed due to the above or any other myriad of reasons. By having them start at 9 this helps not transfer that stress to the new team member and allows the manager to give them their full attention.\nWe will get into gear and accounts a little later, but with most people they like their desk a certain way, they like specific items on their desktop or want to import their browser favorites. This is a great time for them to do that and make their workspace their own and of course, to grab a cup of coffee.\nWe have a fantastic and unique office, and our team members really like it. We typically show people around when we interview, but we want the new team member to be familiar with where things are. They are going to be here eight or more hours a day, it\u2019s nice not to have to hunt for things or ask every time, \u201Cwhere is that conference room?\u201D Our office manager, Michelle, takes the new team member around and shows off our uniqueness, and the nuances of our office.\nEvery Monday we have a company meeting in which we discuss personal highlights in our \u201CList of Awesome\u201D as well as what business is upcoming for the week or month, what is new in the sales cycle, what things are being rolled out, marketing, events and a check-in to see if anyone has too much or not enough work. This is a great and relaxed time in which we all introduce ourselves to the new team member and where the new team member can get a 30,000 foot view of what our company is doing.\nYou can\u2019t get around it, so it\u2019s here. Amanda, our HR manager and Bookkeeper is great and keeps things as light and painless as filling out the handbook, insurance, and W4s can be!\nWhat better way to bring on a new team member than to take them out to lunch on the company their first day? We are a team and a family at BizStream so we try and get to know our new team members on multiple levels. Lunch usually includes the hiring manager, one of both of the owners, and some or all of the team the new team member will be working with. Again, we are family so lunch includes lots of razzing and laughter about whatever is on our plates that week.\nOur building manager also happens to be in charge of Quality Assurance (QA). Josh\u00A0will review how to access the building, reemphasize where some key things are, and then discuss how our QA team handles projects.\nThat\u2019s me, Blair. I like to discuss the software and hardware we use. Where to find things on our corporate file share, how to access our development servers, and how to access our VPN. This can sometimes get bogged down in a lot of technical stuff so I push to keep it light and short unless there are specific questions.\nMike, our Operations Lead, will take the new team member through our typical project process, walk them through our project management software, and show them how and where to track their work time. Every company does project management differently and each project manager leads projects a little differently. We find it helpful to be upfront as possible on how this works at BizStream in order to ease the new team member into our processes and reduce confusion.\nWe primarily use a Content Management System (CMS) named Kentico\u00A0for most of the websites our team builds. BizStream has it\u2019s own standards on how to implement Kentico and it\u2019s code, so the rest of the day is dedicated to working through these standards and getting used to Kentico.\nThe Friday afternoon of the new team member\u2019s first week we schedule a social hour. This is a time for everyone to grab a featured drink, chosen by the new team member, get to know the new team member, and relax as a team.\nBizStream is obviously a tech company and we love our tech! As a new full time team member you get a laptop with the same specs as every other developer. You don\u2019t get a hand me down because the IT guy wanted a new machine, you get a clean machine that is not more than a year old, and is packed with the same amount of power as anyone else in the company. We give you at least three 24\u2033 screens connected to a dock, so taking your laptop to and from meetings is as painless as possible.\nAs a perk, you get to select the keyboard and mouse that you want to work with. It\u2019s just another way that BizStream allows you to customize your workspace to fit your individual taste. The desk is full of BizStream goodies when you arrive. Our swag stock changes from time to time but a new team members can expect things like coffee mugs, travel mugs, sunglasses, pens, notepads, bottle openers and the like.\nWe strive to have all of the necessary accounts built for the new team member before they arrive. We use lots of software in our jobs, both in-house and in the cloud. I do my best to configure all those sign-ons to connect to one of two authentication platforms so when a new team member starts, they don\u2019t have a sheet of 20 different passwords to commit to memory. If I did my job right, it\u2019s one, sometimes two passwords, connected to a single sign-on (SSO) store.\nWe want to know what works, what didn\u2019t, or what could be tweaked to make the experience for the next new team member that much better. About 30 days after the first day, we send out a quick survey that asks questions about your first day and first week on the job. We keep it short and light but we really do desire the feedback to make sure we are on the right track. The Onboarding team reviews each survey and makes improvements as necessary.\nBizStream does not have all the right answers. Our team meets regularly to discuss what works what doesn\u2019t. We have gone through several iterations to get the process to where it is now. Not all things described here will work for all companies, but I think it\u2019s a good starting point to evaluate if you could be doing a better job as a team, department or company.\nWe love to make cool things with cool people.
