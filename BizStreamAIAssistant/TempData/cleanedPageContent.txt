Discovery & Roadmap
Because every project has its own complexities, it’s critical to ensure your teams are aligned around a central vision that:
Let’s get the journey started.
Discovery is a methodical, pragmatic process with critical implications and real-world applications.
The steps you take in this program become a hands-on guide—a Roadmap—that your team and partners will continually reference as you move your initiatives forward.
Start with the why.
When you’re ready to start, the drivers behind your project go beyond the simple project need. To ensure meaningful change, BizStream’s strategists spend time with your internal stakeholders to define:
Gain a user-centric viewpoint.

Document your project’s current and future states.

For Investments & Wealth Institute, the discovery process has been a touchstone activity that has helped us pull together through a lot of change. It has been essential to give a voice to all the stakeholders in our organization, and BizStream’s management and synthesis throughout that process has kept us on track and moving forward.

Branding & Identity Services
Build a shared language that communicates your brand’s value, differentiators, and benefits to build trust, increase sales, and cement customer loyalty.
Every client has a story to tell, and it needs to come through in everything they do. Our creative team works closely with your internal team(s) to get to know the unique qualities of your company or organization, why you do what you do, and the needs of your target audience.
We then translate these qualities into custom visuals to tell your brand’s story through logo, color, typography, imagery, and other branded elements.
Refreshing an existing brand or creating a brand from the ground up takes careful planning, thoughtful discussion, and constant evaluation.
Our creative team works closely with your team to explain the branding process, work through its various steps, and create the best brand for your organization. The results will help establish your brand with a unique and differentiated position in your market, making it easier for your ideal customers to identify and choose your brand.

We deliver all necessary branding files, assets, guidelines, and other documentation to help you take control of your brand moving forward.
A crucial aspect of our marketing evolution was to fully articulate the unique value of our solutions. We needed to understand why customers should—and ideally would—buy from us rather than one of our competitors. Otherwise, how would we be able to help prospects come to that same conclusion? By centering on the customer in this way, we were able to focus our resources on reaching the right audience, improving the likelihood of successful conversions.

Visual Design
A good design and user experience starts with a deep understanding of your business, the competitive landscape, user challenges, and what makes you stand out. We work with your team to gather a wide range of information, including data analytics, stakeholder interviews, persona development, user journey mapping, information architecture, and more.
During this process, we also create high-fidelity designs and prototypes to ensure all of the behind-the-scenes technical specifications translate into a visually engaging and easy-to-use experience for your customers.
Every project we work on is a consciously crafted combination of functionality and branding—a great project must have both.
Whether starting with your existing brand standards or helping you develop new ones, we collaborate closely with every client to create a highly customized and branded design system for their project. We work as an extension of your company’s marketing team to build a digital experience consistent with your brand across all media.
Throughout the design and discovery process, we make sure to keep end users in mind and account for accessibility requirements. Keeping these important aspects in mind helps inform the creation of better site architecture, improved SEO implementation, and an overall better experience for all users.

You know that web accessibility is important.

In partnership with Recite Me—a leading global Enterprise SaaS accessibility solution provider—we’ll help you ensure your modern website reaches your entire audience.
According to Census data, 27% of people in the U.S. have a disability that can make accessing online information difficult. For most organizations, that number alone makes improving web accessibility an imperative. A truly inclusive website provides an integrated approach that goes beyond basic and expected adaptations.
Visual disabilities, including low vision, blindness, color blindness, or light sensitivity
Cognitive disabilities, which include a range of challenges including learning disabilities, neurodiversity, and behavioral and mental health disorders
Communication barriers, including language and cultural differences
Auditory disabilities, including full or partial hearing loss and difficulty understanding sounds when there is background noise
Physical disabilities, such as muscular, sensory, joint, and pain disorders that limit movement and the ability to use devices
Speech disabilities, which make it difficult to use video chat, teleconferencing, or voice recognition technologies
For us, compliance standards are a baseline. But being inclusive means being in true partnership with your customers. It comes from a place of combined empathy and pragmatism. It’s being always open to the needs of others so you can deliver your solutions to everyone who wants them.
Just as you include a Privacy Policy on your site, you should also include an Accessibility Statement. This simple document explains in plain language:
An accessibility toolbar is an embedded widget that provides an array of controls so that site visitors can customize aspects of your site and launch adaptive tools. Some examples of adaptive controls include:
Your accessibility practice is an ongoing process. Accessibility Checker software should give you a structure for active governance, including:

WordPress is a content management system that makes it easy to publish your content online. Everything from simple websites, to blogs, to complex portals and enterprise websites, and even applications, are built with WordPress.
Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo.
Our project wasn’t very complex. Our website didn’t have many bells and whistles, so we were mainly looking for an updated look. Their creative work was quite special. The new website looks very professional and fits our brand.
WordPress combines simplicity for users and publishers with under-the-hood complexity for developers. This makes it flexible while still being easy-to-use.
There are literally thousands of plugins that extend what WordPress does, so the actual functionality is nearly limitless. Make your site do whatever you need it to. Add a store, analytics, newsletter, social media integration; you’re in control with an extensive library of plugins.
Elementor is a page builder plugin that works within WordPress. Elementor’s advanced editor makes it easy to turn your ideas into reality. Visualize and build your website from top to bottom.

Figma
Figma’s intuitive interface and features were built for the web, enabling industry experts and amateur designers alike to design with ease.
Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo.
BizStream’s creative work was their most impressive asset. Moreover, they did their best to understand our business, and they obviously knew what they were doing.
Figma brings together powerful design tools with multiplayer collaboration, allowing teams to explore ideas while capturing quality feedback in real time—or anytime.
Standardize styles, components, and variables so that everything, from color to padding, scales seamlessly across your products and brands.
Dev Mode, in Figma, adds structure and communication channels to the ideation process—so design and development can work better together.

Progress Sitefinity

Siteimprove
The Siteimprove for Kentico extension, built by BizStream, bridges the gap between the Kentico content management system and the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform.
Make the most out of Kentico Xperience with analytics data, SEO insights, and web accessibility insights from the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform. The seamless integration between Siteimprove and Kentico Xperience streamlines workflow efficiencies for your web team. With the extension, your team can fix errors and optimize content directly within the editing environment. Once the detected issues have been assessed, you can re-check the relevant page in real-time and determine if further actions are needed.
I use the [Siteimprove for Kentico] Policy module to find the pages on our website containing contact information for employees who are no longer employed to delete these contact details. Our Danish website consists of approximately 4,500 pages, and our English website of approximately 700 pages. Because we have 850 employees in total, many employees leave every month. Without the Policy module, it would mean a lot of work to find every instance manually.

Our History
Well, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm’s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.
Many may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.
As we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream! 
In 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn’t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting …
Visit the NoWaterBall site
To accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!
The GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream’s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!
In 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!
Remember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.
In 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!
BizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn’t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they’ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.
This program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to BizStream Academy and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
In 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer’s loft with a firefighter’s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!
In 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal’s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream’s unique company structure.
Read the 40 Under Forty – 2014 – Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
Our implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico’s 1,000+ global partners!
Over seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!
In 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by Michigan Celebrates Small Business!
The theme for the year was ‘Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs’ and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.
BizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico’s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!
In 2018, we were recognized as a National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For® winner! We’ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!
In 2019, it was Brian’s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.
Read the 40 Under 40 – Business Leaders – 2019 – Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
With the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.
In 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!
In 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!
Now that we’re officially 21, we’ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We’ve come a long way over the years – from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services – whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
It’s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!
In 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!
In 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions—laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.

Building a More Bingeable Member Website
XtremeAg is a community of highly successful farmers from across the United States coming together to offer an Xtreme look into their personal farming operations by sharing their accumulated knowledge around pursuing profitability and success.
List, List
With the launch of their refreshed and modern website—just in time for the premier of their new television show—the XtremeAg Growers are poised for growth.
The new site dramatically improves brand visibility for searchers, content relevance for visitors, and efficiency for XtremeAg’s content management team. But it’s only the beginning of what they envision for their organization.
In upcoming iterations of the site, the XtremeAg team will work with BizStream to add:
As their dedicated partner, the BizStream team never stops working for XtremeAg. We’ll always be ready to help them evolve the site as their business and member needs change.
We knew we were doing something different in agriculture, with no clear guide on how to develop our online presence. Right from the start, BizStream got on board with our vision—and quickly turned into trusted advisors.
The award-winning Growers of XtremeAg were in high demand for events and speaking engagements. But they wanted to expand their reach and share more of their expertise. They realized that an online member community would be ideal, so they turned to BizStream to build a fully functional member platform—from the ground up.
However, almost immediately after that site launch, they realized that they’d chosen the wrong medium for their mobile audience. We helped the Growers make a hard shift, customizing their blog-centric membership site to enable video publishing at scale.
Since that launch, the XtremeAg Growers have proven to be highly capable content publishers, producing thousands of pieces of video content and expanding across media formats, including webinars and podcasts, as well as live events.
Now, they were set to launch a new TV series, adding yet another media channel. With a site already past its limits and an audience whose viewing habits turn on a dime, the XtremeAg team knew they needed another evolution.
They asked BizStream to re-imagine their site, empowering their teams with a more media-forward platform and empowering their users with more efficient navigation, more relevant search and content recommendations, and a better user experience.
The ultimate goal was to not just get more people to engage—but also keep them connected to content that would truly help them with their specific farming needs and challenges.
For XtremeAg’s Growers and partnering sponsors, member engagement means empowering viewers to consume not just the first video they came for but also the next video…and the next…and the next.
It needs to be bingeable. Like YouTube. Or Spotify.
It needs to be personally relevant, enabling visitors to easily:
It needs to be future-proof, to make immediate improvements and position them for ongoing evolution.
Surface more content
Improve visibility of recent content
Optimize onsite search
Simplify site content management
Improve overall site usability, especially for mobile users
Reduce clicks
Use space more efficiently
Increase content personalization
Improve SEO rankings
We recommended moving the member website to Storyblok, one of our top-pick headless content management systems.
When modernizing a website, transitioning from traditional to headless CMS is becoming a higher priority for member-based organizations like XtremeAg.
Storyblok’s best-in-class Visual Editor, best practices configured by the BizStream dev team, dramatically improves the XtremeAg team’s content management experience with:
Storyblok easily enabled us to integrate the Algolia Recommends AI search tool into the site, feeding it live analytics data to inform the machine learning application and enable more meaningful content discovery:
Storyblok flexibly accommodates both API integrations and custom feature builds, so our team was able to create an optimized video experience that mimics other, familiar media sites, including:
Because we had built XtremeAg’s original site and have remained their hands-on technical partner, BizStream was already in a strong position to remove roadblocks and accelerate the new website.
XtremeAg’s team was one of the first of our clients to leverage our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—a complete starter site that with 90% of the components needed to build a website faster and maximize available resources. With much of the basic web development already in place, we were able to focus resources on more complex features that personalize, filter, and display their content in unique ways.
Starting with wireframes allowed us to work through potential changes in a cost-effective manner. We produced over 30 wires to document the change before moving to design.
Once new layouts were approved, we updated the site design to refresh the established brand and enable improved site navigation, quick links, content personalization, flexible headers, and more.
As with other associations, XtremeAg greatly values their partner sponsorships. Our new design improves partner visibility and enhances member access to partner websites, videos, events, and products.
Because the XtremeAg site contains an enormous amount of structured content, it helped that we had already established strong tagging and taxonomy. With that in place, we were able to create a highly intuitive content structure for the site editors. During the content migration, we also pulled video transcripts and created strong metadata across the pages to make the content consumable for both viewers and search engines.

Transforming UX for a Multilingual Media Enterprise
Crunchyroll brings anime fans the content they love—anytime, anywhere. With an extensive library and immersive experiences, Crunchyroll takes anime beyond the screen, connecting fans and creators on a global scale. As a joint venture between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Japan-based Aniplex, Crunchyroll unites the world of anime under one vibrant platform.
List, List
The resulting Crunchyroll News site is light years ahead of where it started.
Content creators and editors have the power to leverage best practices in SEO, syndication, content discovery, and navigation to attract, engage, and convert anime fans from around the world.
Site visitors now enjoy a truly mobile-first experience, with intuitive navigation, easy ways to find and interact with the content they want on any screen or device, and seamless crossover into the rest of the Crunchyroll ecosystem.
To ensure the experience is uninterrupted, the site is geo-adaptive to display content, searches, and RSS feeds in each users’ preferred language. And users can customize their experience further with the option to toggle between dark-mode and light-mode versions of the site.
In the midst of an enterprise-scale site redesign, Crunchyroll has made the most of their opportunity, establishing Crunchyroll News as the go-to source for anime news, exploration, and engagement.
BizStream has been able to do more for us in 2 months than our other partners were able to do in a year—and they’ve become a key strategic partner for our organization. Their pragmatic approach, responsiveness to our requests, and guidance on marketing strategy has made them an invaluable resource for Investments & Wealth Institute.
It’s not unusual for very large corporate enterprises to have multi-layered websites comprising hundreds—even thousands—of pages.
But media organizations—such as the hugely popular anime streaming site Crunchyroll—house hundreds of thousands of pages and articles. Crunchyroll News, which is just one facet of the organization’s digital presence, provides continuous news and insights to tens of millions of subscribers and freemium members.
The company was working on the release of new corporate branding and a full site redesign, which included integrating the Crunchyroll News site into their ecosystem of videos, manga, games, and merchandise.
In addition, the migration was a unique opportunity to make dramatic improvements in user experience, organic traffic, engagement, and ultimately, subscriptions. The Crunchyroll team knew that the news site had been neglected, and they were ready to modernize it.
It was a tremendous chance to make a meaningful difference for both internal and external users.
To ensure the news site migration met both their timeline and their requirements, Crunchyroll’s technical team decided to bring an outside developer team into the project to work alongside their in-house developers. But they didn’t want just any provider; they needed a fully dedicated dev team with specific knowledge of user experience (UX) design, information architecture design, and their chosen CMS: Storyblok.
As a certified Storyblok partner, BizStream was uniquely positioned to take on their migration, providing experienced Storyblok developers dedicated to completing the news site. And because we are a full-service agency, we also understand the importance of elevating UX design, SEO, and site usability along with tailored CMS configuration and deployment.
But for Crunchyroll, the deciding factor was discovering BizStream’s expertise in creating tailored CMS environments that empower content editors—now and over the long term.
Most developer teams have the ability to configure in-the-box features and enable basic functionality. But Crunchyroll’s news editorial team is an outside-the-box group. They have a large core team and hundreds of contributors publishing in nearly a dozen languages from countries around the world. Their Storyblok configuration needed to be highly adaptable—empowering editors to tell an endless variety of stories, using every kind of media—within an intuitive content structure and defined branding.
Because BizStream specializes in that kind of nuanced focus on content editor usability, we became Crunchyroll’s top choice.
Our experienced dev team provided recommendations to help Crunchyroll make the most of Storyblok’s features.
Before beginning our work with Crunchyroll, we put in place a project management structure that would enable true partnership with their internal team.
The sheer size of the full ecosystem migration demanded that effort be divided between our teams. However, that also meant that for the quarter-million-article News site that was our focus, we needed to establish an even greater level of oversight than in projects we manage independently.
We established shared communication channels, using their team’s familiar collaboration tools and systems.
—all while executing all design and technical priorities.
To ensure that we’d start on firm footing, we performed a deep content audit. Because of the volume of content involved—and because the original site was not responsive—we knew moving text and images into Storyblok would not be straightforward.
We wrote custom tools for this audit, which informed our content modeling exercises.
Then, we created multiple content models, presenting each to the Crunchyroll team and refining each iteration to ensure the final model would provide the editing experience their teams required.
Our UX design experts leveraged Crunchyroll’s brand design system and specifications to create a set of high-fidelity wireframes, a critical time- and cost-saving step for complex sites.
We created pixel-perfect responsive designs for mobile and desktop, with variants for light and dark modes.
We vetted a full range of ADA-compliant colors for their design system, ensuring both light and dark modes meet the AA standard of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
The News site supports content in 11 languages, including Arabic, which reads right-to-left. We created the completely flipped page design shown here to ensure RTL balance and readability.
As we moved into technical development, our team set up the Storyblok space for Crunchyroll News.
We applied the content structure, built a set of core pages for reuse across content categories, and created reusable block components to empower editors to customize new pages.
With these customized, composable components, Crunchyroll’s team can tell any kind of story, incorporating any kind of content—all within their approved publishing workflow and adhering to their brand guidelines.
In the final phase of technical development, we created a comprehensive migration script that handled the transposition of raw HTML-based posts into structured JSON.
Before attempting the full migration, we segmented a sample set of article pages and ran them through a complete testing process.
A detailed quality assurance check revealed any stray issues ahead of the full migration. From there, we ran the scripts on the live environment and coordinated with the internal development team so they could finish their work before launching the new website.

Transforming the Online Experience Across Three Dynamic Websites
Since 1941, the American Society for Nondestructive Testing (ASNT) has been recognized as the leading standardizing and certifying body for NDT professionals. They are the heart of learning, innovation, and career advancement for the people who ensure safe and reliable infrastructure, vehicles, products, energy production, and more.
AVA Digital Award Gold Winner, Redesign
In the 15 years since their last brand and web refresh, the society has strengthened and expanded their global partnerships and built innumerable layers into their online presence. But for website users, it was increasingly difficult to navigate those layers and access the value that the society provides.
To address those pains—and elevate their organization as the global leader it truly is—ASNT had embarked on a bold digital transformation, updating or replacing major member-facing technologies and systems including their association management system (AMS), learning management system (LMS), marketing platform, publications hub, and member community platform.
At the heart of these systems are three core websites: ASNT.org, ASNT Certification Services, and ASNT Foundation—all inextricably linked across the experience with ASNT.
They leaned on our expertise and guidance to ensure the new sites delivered:
When The ASNT transitioned from a costly and fragile Sitecore website to a modern, flexible, and future-proofed Storyblok headless CMS solution—powered by our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—the impact was dramatic. By making the switch, ASNT significantly reduced costs while streamlining content operations and accelerating marketing efficiency. After a thorough analysis of their savings and performance improvements, it’s clear that this move delivered measurable ROI across multiple fronts. Here’s a closer look at the key results:
BizStream’s guidance has been indispensable to ASNT as we modernize our website and technology systems. They have become a bridge between our teams, supporting our key stakeholders with specific expertise and resources. And they provide broad consulting across strategic needs, from IT systems to UX design to SEO. Their partnership has enabled us to consolidate our efforts into a coherent plan—and maintain momentum for our transformation.
Over the course of its rich history, ASNT has become a treasure trove of not just standards and certification resources but also information, training, publications, industry leadership, advocacy, mentorship, and technological innovation.
And of course, all those interconnected parts have become more complex over time. Both site visitors and staff struggled with the complexity of finding information and completing tasks—especially because many tasks ranged across more than one online platform. The society, too, struggled with the cost and resource intensity of operating sites on three separate, expensive, and unwieldy platforms.
Thus, in addition to modernizing their overall brand and online presence, updating these essential sites provided opportunities for truly impactful improvements.
ASNT had a lot of motivation to move their project forward and a lot of ambition about how they wanted to reposition their organization. However, they also knew they needed to validate the direction they were headed with their members and their internal stakeholders.
So before jumping into web site redesign and CMS replatforming, we led them through a comprehensive Website Discovery and Roadmap project. This project phase was enormously beneficial for corralling the complexity of ASNTs project. The process enabled us to:
For this multi-layered global society, providing autonomy and control for their teams was critical—as was providing a seamless experience for visitors performing tasks across sites and systems.
For this kind of enterprise-level complexity, Storyblok headless CMS truly shines, providing a central content repository and highly flexible framework that enable ASNT to:
By leveraging BizStream’s turnkey Web Accelerator framework, ASNT is able to dramatically reduce development overhead and costs while taking advantage of built-ins such as:
Nuanced governance controls help editors:
Storyblok’s best-in-class Visual Editor, enhanced with Web Accelerator’s flexible, best-practices-built components, delivers an environment where content teams can easily:
With the roadmap we completed in ASNT’s Discovery phase, we moved their triple-website-redesign project forward. Our experienced teams delivered leadership and clarity by centralizing project management for the creation of all three websites. By managing the projects in parallel, we were able to recommend effective content consolidation and a logical user journey while delivering efficiencies in integrations across sites and systems.
For ASNT, modernizing their global online presence started with modernizing their brand—especially their logo, which had a distinctly dated look.
Returning to our site usability study, we applied UX best practices to help ASNT tell a more compelling story and reduce clicks and friction in the user journey. We developed:
A primary requirement for all of ASNT’s sites was to align page content with user needs and tasks. Our account managers and content team did a deep dive into ASNT’s user personas. Then, we collaborated to:
In addition, we wrote new entry-point, informational, and interstitial pages to create a better user guidance and enhance SEO. These pages also modeled panel and page layouts to guide ASNT’s internal content team as they carried forward content changes on their extensive internal pages.
By using our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—which provided a solid framework and WCAG 2.2 accessibility for all the sites out of the box—we increased the speed of technical development, enabling simultaneous builds across three websites.
BizStream is more than a tech support provider for ASNT. From the selection of the Storyblok CMS to building the sites to establishing integrations with existing and new tools, BizStream is an active and supportive strategic partner.
With Storyblok best-practices in place, we are able to foster seamless integrations that enable ASNT to choose best-of-breed, modern technology solutions that provide the best possible ROI in a composable ecosystem.
BizStream managed ASNT’s complex scope and project requirements, handing literally thousands of details over nearly 2 years of transformation.
With our experienced project and account managers at the helm, ASNT’s internal team kept their society humming. They relied on our dedicated in-house experts to provide leadership in everything from UX strategy to content development, design recommendations to training their CMS users.

Enriching Member Experience, Elevating Association Value
Founded in 1985, the Investment & Wealth Institute (IWI) exists to elevate and advance the financial advice profession. By uniting members, educators, leadership, and advocates, IWI addresses critical challenges in the industry: demonstrating the value of specialized investment, retirement, and wealth management services and fostering public trust in the professionals delivering them. Guided by clear principles, IWI empowers its community with resources, education, and a shared commitment to excellence, ensuring the financial advice profession continues to meet the evolving needs of the public.
List, List
Every association needs to drive revenue to continue advancing their mission.
IWI’s new website puts their mission and values front and center, while positioning their highest value offerings in easy reach.
Most important, the organization is now able to make meaningful, positive changes to their site, content, and tech stack—without starting from scratch ever again.
BizStream has been able to do more for us in 2 months than our other partners were able to do in a year—and they’ve become a key strategic partner for our organization. Their pragmatic approach, responsiveness to our requests, and guidance on marketing strategy has made them an invaluable resource for Investments & Wealth Institute.
For associations today, staying relevant is critical to their long-term sustainability.
For Investments & Wealth Institute (IWI), reviving that relevance—and making their industry-leading certifications easy for new and existing members to embrace—had become a critical need.
Their old website had become overgrown, overblown, and overly difficult to navigate—for both site editors and site visitors. Existing and prospective members couldn’t easily find what they were looking for.
And their most important message—the value of their certifications and education programs—had been buried.Leaning into the trusted relationship they had with BizStream, IWI looked to fully transform their brand and build a modern website that showcases:
The efforts of IWI’s marketing, membership, education, events, and sales teams were shackled by a traditional, decentralized infrastructure and rigid page templates.
To move multiple agendas forward, internal teams had splintered the site navigation, diluting the brand with competing messages and duplicate content.
IWI’s leadership team knew the website redesign would be a herculean effort, but they were looking for several non-negotiable outcomes. The new site needed to:
BizStream started IWI’s process with a detailed Website Discovery project to align their stakeholders, leadership, and board and clarify the most critical opportunities for website transformation.
As a certifying membership organization and professional association, IWI’s website is the hub of member, partner, and prospect interactions across an interconnected architecture of best-of-breed technologies.
To create a unified, scalable, and future-proofed solution, we recommended that IWI build the new site in Storyblok. Moving to a modern, headless architecture enables them to:
Storyblok’s centralized content architecture gives IWI’s disparate internal teams a single place to unify their storytelling, initiatives, and communications.
BizStream’s UI/UX designers and content strategists teamed to dramatically consolidate the volume of content that visitors must sift to find what they are looking for. Navigation is streamlined, key information is easy to digest, and common actions are easy to complete.
Storyblok enables fast, easy, API-based integrations with IWI’s existing tools and technologies. Without ripping and replacing systems that are essential to their operations—and leveraging BizStream’s comprehensive Web Accelerator components—they now have a seamless, intuitive experience. Members can get whatever they need, on desktop or mobile, and always feel like they are at home with IWI.
Once we had completed IWI’s Website Discovery project, we had a clear roadmap for making sure their website rebuild stayed on focus, on track, and on budget. Our experienced account teams took a leadership role, directing the project, ensuring timely milestone completions, and guiding their teams through a phased process following a logical progression.
Before moving the visual elements into a design, our designers and account strategists produced a comprehensive set of wireframes, prototypes that enable us to map the user journey from top-level navigation through every interaction.
BizStream’s creative team worked closely with their executive leaders to create a fresh visual design and messaging that faithfully represent the association’s mission, values, and position as an innovator in the financial services industry. Our teams translated their core concepts to create an instant, emotional connection and convey a member-centric view of the practical and long-term value of IWI’s certifications and membership.
With an approved sitemap and layouts, our design and content teams went to work producing high-resolution mockups and fully revised page content for more than 50 core site pages.
We also coached IWI’s editorial team, empowering them to carry forward the same brand and content changes on their extensive internal pages, leveraging our best-practices–configured components in Storyblok.
From the selection of the Storyblok CMS to building the site to establishing integrations with existing and new tools, BizStream is more than a tech support provider.
We are a strategic partner, continually moving IWI towards modern technology solutions that provide the best possible ROI in a best-of-breed, composable ecosystem.

Ensuring Association Adaptability with a Modern Website CMS
For 125 years, Big I Illinois has been supporting independent insurance agents and consumers throughout the state. The membership consists of agencies that offer property, casualty, life, health and benefits insurance. As independent agents, association members represent more than one company and can offer customers a choice of policies to fit their needs.
List, List
As a nonprofit, Big I Illinois doesn’t have unlimited funds for endless technology changes. So when a major change—like selecting a new CMS—is necessary, making the right choice is critical.
With BizStream, they found a partner who was willing to speak plainly with them, help them get the greatest value from the solution they chose, and position them for greater autonomy and control over their website and their content for the long term.
Today, Big I Illinois has a site that empowers its content editors in ways they’ve never experienced. They can:
And most important, the Storyblok CMS is easy for their users to learn, understand, and use.
BizStream continues to partner with the Big I team, providing ongoing support and helping them add new features and workflows so they’ll continue to get the greatest value that Storyblok offers.
It’s easy to become siloed in our own association’s world. But having an experienced partner who could guide us through the process—and encourage us to think as a user—was very beneficial! BizStream listened. And they understood what I needed before I realized I needed it. The combination of knowledge, experience, and empathetic guidance created a fantastic final product.
For many associations, website redesigns are deferred maintenance—always taking a back seat to projects that are more urgent, or easier, or cheaper.
The trouble is, the website is the front door for members. So when that entry point no longer works for you or your members, it’s time to make a change.
That was where Big I Illinois—previously Independent Insurance Agents of Illinois (IIA of IL)—found themselves. This professional association provides agencies and agents with industry resources, operations support, advocacy, and vital business connections.
But the Director of Communications, was frustrated by the inflexibility of the site, which made it extremely difficult for her and her team to demonstrate the powerful value of Big I Illinois membership.
Big I Illinois turned to BizStream for recommendations. She made it clear she was not looking for just another website vendor. She needed a partner and a guide who would help her make a lasting, meaningful change in how they managed their site, content, and technology.
She found the partner she needed with BizStream. Our proven process and experienced teams helped her break out of the limitations she’d been working with and empower her organization’s:
Big I Illinois realized their website had reached a tipping point: it was more costly to keep putting money into their old site than to replace it.
Content management in the rigid and antiquated platform was limited to exactly two page-layout templates. Any changes to the site had to go through the external vendor’s ticket system, taking significant time and expense.
As the association approached its name change, the team wanted to give the site a new look. But more important, she wanted to take back control of her story and her marketing efforts.
The new site needed to:
Because Big I Illinois’ most critical need was empowering their content editors, we recommended they build their new site in Storyblok. Although many headless CMSs offer benefits for modernizing website and technology architecture, Storyblok is the only CMS we found that is truly designed with content editors in mind—and at an affordable price point.
The Visual Editor ensures that both new and experienced business users can come up to speed quickly and feel comfortable utilizing the systems’ flexible features.
In addition, Storyblok will help Big I Illinois continue to adapt their site as needed with advantages such as:
Our teams leveraged our deep association experience to deliver association-specific components and features, including enhanced visibility into events, education, and resources.
Big I Illinois editors are no longer stuck with one way to present information. They can create, compose, change layouts, and re-imagine their story—all in Storyblok’s intuitive Visual Editor.
The old site required numerous clicks just to find simple information. It was easy for users to get lost.
We helped the Big I Illinois team rethink their user journey and delivered changes to the site map, menus, and navigation. Now, users can see themselves in the association—and find personalized pathways to the information that’s truly relevant for them.
For users needing to access member resources and benefits, we implemented a centralized Solution Center, adding SSO and Algolia search. Then, we pulled member content from the AMS into a user-friendly, interactive layout that reduces clicks and friction.
The new search functionality enables users to easily log in, search by topic or keyword, and filter results. And content editors can seamlessly add content and control its visibility to members and non-members.
Being locked into a restrictive website doesn’t just impact how members see your association. It also limits innovation, creating patterns of thinking that prevent teams from imagining fresh approaches to their work.
For the Big I Illinois team, breaking those patterns was key to making meaningful changes in her site and her organization. BizStream’s experienced consultant team provided hands-on guidance, leading her through our defined process.
For any size website project, from simple to complex, the discovery step is a time and cost saver. Through the Website Discovery and Roadmap phase of the project, Big I Illinois got a fresh understanding of the members who come to their site, what they need, and where they encounter roadblocks.
Our analyses and alignment discussions revealed insights that helped the team visualize a better user journey, brand new navigation, and significant opportunities to consolidate and simplify content.
Wireframing—high resolution layout prototypes—help save time and costs by enabling our UI/UX designers to develop modern page layouts before moving them into a visual design. These flexible frameworks facilitate productive discussions, helping Big I Illinois get an even clearer picture of the user journey, from top-level navigation through every interaction.
Since Big I Illinois was implementing a brand uplift along with their name change, we created a visual design that leverages their professional color palette in a clean, modern page design.
Simple icons provide visual cues throughout the site to indicate links that go to external sites, video players, or downloadable resources. Details like these help visitors almost unconsciously understand where they are and how to take next steps.

Kentico Xperience Site of the Year, Kentico Xperience Site of the Month
FERNO’s web presence was split across six existing websites. The company wanted to bring them all together into one global site, Ferno.com – a website originally built in Kentico. This would enable them to fold all FERNO Group companies, strategic partner companies, and their international location-based websites into a more seamless web experience for their global brand.
They also wanted to address performance issues, enable the website to be used as a sales tool, and empower their teams to more easily manage and update content.
BizStream continues to demonstrate a high degree of capabilities and expertise with Kentico. They are true professionals who strive to make the customer experience a high priority.
To give FERNO a properly working site, BizStream thoroughly assessed the previous Kentico installation.

The production database server, Web (IIS) Server, Kentico CMS installation, and many custom settings were also audited. The final solution included:

Revitalizing a Brand and Website to Cultivate Growth and Customer Engagement
Founded in 1982 as a wholesale greenhouse, Countryside Greenhouse has since flourished into a comprehensive retail operation with deep roots in the West Michigan community, and the largest retail greenhouse in Michigan. For many years now, Countryside Greenhouse has been a steadfast presence, offering unparalleled expertise and a genuine passion for everything green. From their humble beginnings to their current status as a thriving retail hub, they have become a cherished staple in the region, embodying a commitment to quality.
Countryside Greenhouse had a change in ownership and came to BizStream knowing they wanted to update their website. Upon initial discussions, it was discovered that the Countryside Greenhouse brand needed to be updated as well. Working together, BizStream and Countryside Greenhouse crafted a new brand identity and visual experience that better suits who Countryside Greenhouse is as a company and resonates more strongly with their target audience.
After launch, Countryside Greenhouse’s website improved across the board, with notable increases in gift card sales and website traffic. BizStream’s development and design enhancements led to stronger mobile and desktop performance, improved accessibility, and better SEO optimization. These results highlight the new site’s successful impact on driving engagement and performance.
For us, it was really important to go through the branding exercise to take some time and invest in that thought process of understanding who we were, how we wanted to present ourselves, what our voice was, and what our messaging was. I recommend doing all that work for anyone who’s looking for a major refresh of their brand and website. Once you have your brand defined, the work related to the website refresh becomes much easier to do.
BizStream worked with Countryside Greenhouse to establish four brand pillars to lay the foundation for the redesign.

Rebranding for a Leading-Edge Relaunch
InfinityQS® is the leading provider of Statistical Process Control (SPC) software and services to manufacturers worldwide. With 40,000+ installed licenses currently in use, InfinityQS quality management solutions save leading manufacturers millions of dollars each year. Like many traditional software companies, InfinityQS is undergoing a digital transformation in an effort to modernize its offerings.
List, List
The InfinityQS visual brand serves to communicate the essence of what the company offers the world: data visualization that is masterful, powerful, helpful, and intelligent.
By using clean lines, friendly typography, bold colors, and patterns inspired by the movement of data, InfinityQS’s new brand shows the world that data is beautiful.
A crucial aspect of our marketing evolution was to fully articulate the unique value of our solutions. We needed to understand why customers should—and ideally would—buy from us rather than one of our competitors. Otherwise, how would we be able to help prospects come to that same conclusion? By centering on the customer in this way, we were able to focus our resources on reaching the right audience, improving the likelihood of successful conversions.
Fighting brand creep is an ongoing effort for many organizations. Over time, individuals and teams tinker with brand standards as they create content and ads; templates shift; colors morph; and your style inexplicably merges with your partners and vendors. The result is messy, blurry, indistinct branding that loses its punch.
When that happens, it’s time for a brand refresh. That’s where InfinityQS was at the start of a major product campaign: the launch of a new product-led sales model for their industry-leading manufacturing quality platform, Enact.
The product is an elegant solution that enables manufacturers to extract extraordinary value from their production data. But although Enact had evolved since its inception, its logo and primary look and feel had not been updated. And the company’s brand, overall, had experienced that slow creep.
InfinityQS needed a clear, unified message embodied in a clean, modern look to bring visibility and impact to their product relaunch.
InfinityQS is in a unique position to support and accelerate the efforts of the people at the heart of manufacturing operations—and help them deliver positive business outcomes. Enact’s relaunch needed to clearly speak to those audiences, so we started by reviewing and updating their personas, as well as their product and company messaging.
Those foundational messages acted as an emotional and tonal guide for the development of a complete uplift of InfinityQS’s visual brand. Starting with the existing brand’s primary colors, our design team created a modern look and feel that still retains the authority of the industry-leading brand.

Building a Foundation for Website Success
Rio Tinto is a well-established global leader in the supply, science, and production of the most technologically advanced aluminum on the planet. Their START Responsible Aluminium initiative brings transparency and traceability across the entire global value chain. With key environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria verified through blockchain technology, START customers can prove their sustainability commitment and assess areas for organizational progress.
List, List
START Responsible Aluminium’s new website gave them a fresh, contemporary brand presence. The project met the core objective of communicating START’s value in a concise and minimalistic style while maintaining consistency with Rio Tinto’s cornerstone standards. The site offers improved support for the internal sales team’s onboarding efforts, giving them more consumable content for prospects and customers to learn about the program’s value. What’s more, content management is more intuitive, with the site serving as a foundation to evolve sustainable aluminium efforts going forward. Rio Tinto now better communicates START’s value so they can more effectively deliver key ESG criteria to customers and connect them to every stage of the aluminum value chain.
We knew we were doing something different in agriculture, with no clear guide on how to develop our online presence. Right from the start, BizStream got on board with our vision—and quickly turned into trusted advisors.
While the START program offers significant value, its communication needed to be articulated in more concise, simplified terms for target audiences. Additionally, the START team required a more intuitive content management experience for collaborators around the globe to administer content. With these needs in mind, program stakeholders approached BizStream to re-launch the START website.
BizStream listened to the needs of the START team and mapped out a phased solution for the new website. The planning stage included a site functionality needs assessment, which informed the sitemap, content strategy, and UX requirements. In this phase, we identified Storyblok, a headless content management system (CMS), to provide a user-friendly content editing experience. In the design and creative support stage, BizStream utilized Storyblok to create efficient customer digital journeys focused on the target audiences’ unique needs.
We developed the site navigation, taxonomy, interfaces, and primary site content to be uncomplicated, while still providing pathways for long-form content to be readily accessible for site users. Last, we entered the technical development stage, which included CMS setup and configuration, creating site pages, and significant testing. BizStream collaborated with START to design various custom widgets for streamlined content creation moving forward, including content, video, and image modals within the Storyblok framework.

Unifying Brand Experience and Performance for a Leading Water Screening Manufacturer
Hydrolox™ is the brand name applied to engineered polymer traveling screens invented and supplied directly by Intralox, who has been supplying screens directly to the water-extracting world for more than 20 years.
Having previously worked on Intralox’s Commercial Food Sanitation website, BizStream again collaborated with Intralox to revamp their outdated hydrolox.com website.
The primary goals were to reconstruct the site using the headless CMS platform, Kontent.ai, establishing a robust technology stack and content model for long-term stability while ensuring seamless upgradability and responsiveness. This initiative aimed to enhance user experience and searchability, aligning it closely with the existing technology stack of Intralox.com and its other brands.
The new Hyrolox site was meticulously crafted to mirror the look, feel, and technology stack of other Intralox sites, including Commercial Food Sanitation. This approach emphasized visual alignment and administrative ease. Special attention was given to improving page speed and implementing a filtering system for Case Studies.

Website Rejuvenation
U.S. Borax, part of Rio Tinto, is a global leader in borate fertilization and science. It provides approximately 30% of the world’s supply of refined borates from its world-class mine in Boron, California, about 100 miles northeast of Los Angeles.Boron Operations is the heart of a global business that includes refineries, shipping facilities, and a network of warehouses and stock points. It serves more than 1,000 customers in more than 100 countries. The company is acknowledged for its leadership in developing Borates’ potential and its world-class safety, environmental, and community practices.
2018 BMA Colorado Gold Key Awards, Gold: Rio Tinto Borates – Apps, Tools and Demos
With a benefit-focused message, relevant educational content, interactive tools, and increased visuals, the new site quickly delivered a noticeable boost in performance. Content is localized for Portuguese, Spanish, and Chinese speakers, improving accessibility and broadening the site’s reach. This thoughtful approach to design and messaging supports continued growth and allows for future expansion into additional languages as needed.
The website BizStream developed for us makes it faster for prospects to find product information and evaluate the best U.S. Borax product for their application. And existing customers can more easily find direct contacts when questions arise.
Rio Tinto’s U.S. Borax division produces nearly a third of the world’s supply of refined boron—an essential nutrient for healthy, abundant crops. With a global presence and decades of scientific research and educational information, the company is committed to helping agronomists and growers feed the world’s population. But to do so, it needed a more compelling, intuitive online presence. The division’s existing site lacked rich storytelling and buried its most useful information in static PDF files. The site also did little to promote customer communication or brand awareness.
To educate visitors about the value and cost-effectiveness of refined borate supplementation, we created infographics that illustrate the refinement process and video storytelling to aid information retention. An interactive crop guide moves vital content out of static PDFs, making it easier to search and use. And a new ROI calculator helps consumers immediately relate real value to U.S. Borax Agricultural products.
Through regional content and success stories, consumers around the globe can quickly find information that relates specifically to their needs and can more easily contact local distributors and experts.

Centralizing Website Content Management with Storyblok
Automox is a cloud-native IT automation platform that simplifies patch management, configuration, and endpoint security across Windows, macOS, and Linux devices. Designed to help IT teams reduce risk and streamline operations, Automox provides a centralized, automated solution for keeping systems secure and up to date—no VPNs or on-premises infrastructure required. By leveraging automation and real-time visibility, organizations can proactively manage vulnerabilities, enforce compliance, and improve overall cybersecurity posture from anywhere.
List, List
Automox’s new website provides valuable, rich content that is more available for everyone. It’s easy for site visitors to find relevant information. The resource center is organized topically, and each topic is itself a functional, keyword-optimized landing page. Users can learn right on the page and easily connect to additional related materials.
Site performance, too, is night-and-day. Storyblok’s content-first model simplifies the overall technical architecture, and enterprise hosting on Netlify speeds the frontend display of content for users and search engines.
BizStream has been a great partner for us, helping continually grow and evolve our digital presence. They’ve supported us with SEO strategies and optimized content, rapid development for strategic web content, and most importantly, an overhaul of our resources center that will migrate our site into a modern, blazing fast CMS. Everything we’ve done with them has focused on up-leveling our ability to drive more and better conversions. They are a crucial technical and development consultant for our success.
Automox’s SaaS model depends on empowering enterprise IT teams to self-discover, self-start, and self-educate. To that end, Automox provides substantive support, a user community, e-learning, and a rich resource center. All these pieces had been built over time around their monolithic website. However, without a central CMS, management of all those elements—in multiple platforms—had become problematic.
Managing content resources was the biggest source of pain for their teams. Blogs were housed in Ghost, downloadable assets and their landing pages in Marketo, and news and events were manually managed in a separate workflow, making searchability across topics impossible for site users. When they needed to add new downloadable content, the marketing team was hamstrung by a tedious process that required creating site references, building landing pages, and uploading assets in multiple places. And business users could not make any site changes—every page change had to go through the tech team.
In addition, as their brand visibility grew, they needed a news and press center—but none of their existing platforms provided a satisfactory way to add that new content to their site. Automox needed a better solution but couldn’t see a way forward that didn’t involve scrapping and rebuilding their entire site—and that was not an option.
BizStream helped Automox centralize its critical blog and resource content in Storyblok, leveraging enterprise-ready capabilities to dramatically improve the user experience for site visitors and business users alike.
We migrated their blog and resource content; designed a highly flexible content model; and provided an enhanced user experience with improved asset display, navigation, and topical categorization. In addition, BizStream added a new press center, which includes a headline feed, featured news items, and press kit materials.
Enabling direct content management under a centralized architecture was essential for Automox’s marketing team. Our developers designed a flexible and intuitive content model that is intentionally adaptable as content needs scale.
The Storyblok Visual Editor provides a transformational improvement for business users. Marketers now have the power to make their own content changes and updates—quickly and easily—and see those changes as they make them. They can customize robust content experiences for specific high-value content, all while still allowing users to request PDF versions of the content in exchange for their contact information through integrated Marketo forms.

Enhancing Digital Storytelling for a Global Architectural Lighting Brand

Lucifer Lighting enlisted BizStream to help redesign their site and update a set of functionality and capabilities within it.

For over 50 years, the Petersen Asphalt Research Conference (PARC) has been bringing together top researchers, highway officials, suppliers, producers, and other industry top minds who are working to advance the specification and performance of asphalt and bitumen.
As with many time-honored fellowships, PARC’s existing website was beginning to show its age. Though functional, the site left much to be desired in readability, speed, and back-end efficiency. Core activities like abstract submissions, sponsorship coordination, and event registration were cumbersome for conference administrators.
Like a potholed county road in need of repaving, the PARC website was ready for modernization. The conference coordinators leaned on BizStream’s expertise in recommending the right technology solutions for their express needs. The natural choice was Storyblok, a headless content management system with a flexible and intuitive platform. As a Storyblok certified partner, we configured the new ecommerce site to streamline previous inefficiencies and integrate with Stripe, their payment processing solution.

Building a Multi-Brand, Consumer-First eCommerce Platform for a Furniture Industry Leader
Sauder Woodworking Co., North America’s leading producer of ready-to-assemble furniture, initially developed its own informational custom website in 1998 and upgraded it in 2004. With the site needing a makeover, Sauder also thought it time to give consumers what they’d been asking for — a website to both browse product lines and find retailer information as well as an online platform to purchase furniture.
Kentico Xperience Site of the Year
BizStream helped Sauder build a multi-branded, fully functional eCommerce website to feature its brands and products and provide a customizable shopping checkout process.
Sauder partners with numerous firms for solution delivery. Our experience with BizStream was a true working partnership dedicated to common goals while actually having fun in the process! Sauder was impressed with the level of technical knowledge BizStream brought to the table.
There was an instant connection and collaborative partnership, so Sauder decided to invest with BizStream. I would place BizStream as one of our top vendors of choice.

Optimizing Content Management, Search, and User Engagement for a Global Hospitality Brand
Kimball Hospitality is the leader in hospitality casegoods. Trusted by the most prominent brands in the industry, Kimball brings a best-in-class product and an all-inclusive experience to designers, buyers, and owners. Kimball specializes in casegoods and seating projects, and the recent acquisition of D’Style, a powerhouse in the public space sector, significantly expands its capability as a full facility provider. Kimball provides services that allow them to be a “concierge” to those who partner with them, making the company the “go-to” for hospitality projects. Kimball specializes in design consultation, product engineering, and project management, on-time shipments and installation support.
Kimball Hospitality needed help to develop a re-designed website in the Kontent.ai platform. Since its launch, Kimball Hospitality has seen an increase in monthly visitors and an uptick in requests for quotes due to the information it can now provide on its new website.
Ultimately, we have had a very good experience with Kontent.ai. As people who were not experienced with the system, we were able to pick up on it and adapt fairly quickly. BizStream was a pertinent asset to getting our website up quickly and efficiently.  They adapted to our requests and changes very quickly, and we are very pleased with the ease and quickness that both solutions provide to our business. This has been a game changer for us. Our website looks and functions beautifully.

Turning Data Overload into a Seamless Digital Experience for a Life Science Organization
With over 30,000 members, including researchers, educators and health professionals, the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is one of the largest life science societies in the world. The mission of ASM is to advance the microbiological sciences as a vehicle for understanding life processes and to apply and communicate this knowledge for the improvement of health and environmental and economic well-being worldwide.
Kentico Site of the Year Finalist, Gold Circle Award Winner
BizStream helped ASM with a Kentico Xperience implementation, including other integrations, such as: Microsoft Azure Cognitive Search, NetForum, Shibboleth, and more. ASM is incredibly happy with the project results and has seen the following impact to their web presence:
BizStream created a custom system to eliminate duplicate content for ASM. The content audits were able to reorganize a site of 20,000 pages to a more streamlined and manageable 3,000 pages. From there, BizStream was able to reduce the number of 404 errors to almost none.
With the aim to set up the American Society for Microbiology for the future with tagged, structured content, ASM’s digital team worked with the developers at BizStream to open up the box at Kentico and make templates and models the staff could use in a multitude of ways. Multiple integrations, tag-based aggregation, and a flexible taxonomy earned ASM a best website award and laid a foundation to serve ASM’s 30K+ members and advance microbiology.

Unifying Four Business Units into One Seamless Digital Experience for a Leading Benefits Provider
Trustmark is a national employee benefits company with specialized expertise in voluntary benefits, self-funded health benefits, and health and fitness management. For more than 100 years, Trustmark has helped people and businesses thrive.
Kentico Xperience Site of the Month
Trustmark needed to consolidate its existing business unit websites into one central, dynamic site. Previously, the business unit-specific sites (Voluntary Benefits, Health Benefits, Small Business Benefits, and HealthFitness) catered to different markets and business sizes. This approach needed to be updated to match a new brand initiative. Trustmark’s goal was to ensure that the next iteration of the One Brand site provided consistent branding across all of its business units.
While Trustmark had partnered with Bizstream on several Kentico projects in the past, this was by far the largest and most complex one to date. BizStream was able to translate the function and design requirements into manageable agile development sprints. The Trustmark Marketing and Web Development teams worked closely with the Bizstream team to refine the requirements and update components when needed. The modular nature of Kentico Page Builder allowed us to roll out features in sprints that enabled our internal stakeholders to develop content quickly and see immediate results. Instead of being overwhelmed, our internal stakeholders were able to meet the milestones more easily. BizStream Kentico specialization made it possible to Trustmark to launch our new One Brand consolidated website on time.

List, List
Colorado State University’s College of Business has had a longstanding working relationship with BizStream, even preceding our establishment as an agency. The college uses Kentico, a content management and enterprise marketing system, for its website development, and BizStream is responsible for the site’s hosting, upgrades, technical assessments, specific security projects, and targeted tech projects. The CSU College of Business is well known, and its online MBA degree program was ranked No. 1 in Colorado by U.S. News and World Report in 2020 and No. 13 worldwide by QS Online MBA Rankings in 2019. The college’s staff needs to constantly suggest and implement ideas for maintaining this level of prominence.
BizStream helps broaden college staff’s knowledge in areas where they might not have as much expertise on the core Kentico solution and provides assistance for special projects. Recently, our agency created a content pillar—keyword-rich site content that creates a natural, organic draw for users who are searching for specific information, themes, and terms—and we provide ongoing support for their technology and marketing teams.
BizStream’s bolt-on technical assistance and content allows the College of Business to easily adapt to its ever-evolving needs at a moment’s notice.

Enhancing Search and Lead Generation for a National Wellness Leader
HealthFitness is a nationwide team of more than 2,700 professionals who offer wellness and injury prevention and treatment. HealthFitness is backed by Trustmark Benefits.
Trustmark Benefits engaged BizStream to update its Kentico CMS HealthFitness website from the current state to the MVC development model with components to match its other Trustmark Benefits websites.
Other goals included:
BizStream specializes in Kentico, and that’s evident in their depth of knowledge and familiarity with the product. I felt confident that they were up to speed on the latest version of Kentico and would develop my project in a timely manner. From a purely content management system perspective, Kentico has a lot of strengths. While my project doesn’t leverage all the great features, we were able to add functionality easily without a long development process and will continue to do so as our business requirements change. I would have no hesitation in recommending Kentico for CMS projects.

National Food Group sought BizStream’s help to rejuvenate its Zee Zees brand foodservice Kentico website. The site needed a redesign and eCommerce rework to maintain consistency across other Zee Zees sites and drive their B2B sales.
The BizStream team was very organized and clear as to resources, capacity, timing, and deliverables, and our launch was seamless. We appreciate BizStream’s knowledgeable team and our ongoing partnership with them!

That leaves them free to focus on their mission: Bringing renewable energy to the world.

Uniting a Public Website and Member Portal for a Leading Building Materials Cooperative
Lumbermens Merchandising Corporation (LMC) a leading Forest Products and Building Materials Buying Group in the USA owned by independent lumber and building material dealers. There are more than 1,400 LMC dealer locations all over the United States and into the Bahamas.
BizStream successfully achieved the comprehensive overhaul and modernization of LMC’s online presence. The project involved rebuilding and enhancing both the public site (lmc.net) and the authenticated member area (lmc.net/members) into a unified application using .Net and Kentico Xperience.
Other Goals included:
Outcomes of the LMC.net project have been highly positive, garnering enthusiasm from both LMC staff and the Dealer Network. The new platform enables Dealers to access the site and LMC services seamlessly on mobile devices, a capability previously unavailable. The overall site speed and performance have seen a significant boost, particularly benefiting Dealers outside the US East Coast.
After having Kentico perform some work for us, we asked them to recommend a partner with which to continue working on our site. Kentico recommended three companies. Through the interview process, I got the best feeling about BizStream. It turned out to be the right choice for us.
We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the project. BizStream’s work is impressive, especially knowing how challenging it can be to work with someone else’s existing code. BizStream ‘went above and beyond,’ delivering something to the end user.
I would definitely encourage others to go with BizStream for development work, especially Kentico development. I was super impressed with how knowledgeable Brian [McKeiver] is and how closely BizStream works with Kentico. BizStream support was also top notch. Brian was very responsive, as was the support team.

Empowering Employers with a Secure and HIPAA-Compliant COVID-19 Symptom Tracking Solution
SymReport is a COVID-19 symptom tracker application designed for employers first. SymReport includes a robust dashboard, kiosk feature, and historical tracking—helping employers limit liability with an option to provide limited data to the government.
In late May 2020, a health and welfare consultant based in West Michigan engaged BizStream to develop a customized COVID-19 symptom tracker catering to the specific needs of employers. The consultant sought an affordable solution for their clients, offering a unique symptom-tracking system tailored to each client’s business. The primary requirements included the ability to monitor and generate reports on employees, notify managers/supervisors of symptomatic cases, and seamlessly integrate with their HRIS for comprehensive data tracking and compliance.
Despite free tools in the region, such as Spectrum Health’s COVID-19 tracking application, these options lacked the capability for employers to retain reported information. Additionally, many free tools had service gaps, rendering them incomplete solutions.
BizStream has been great—they are not looking to drive margin on the product; they are doing this as a community service.

It’s hard to overstate the value of the messaging documentation we delivered. Immediately, teams from across the company began using it for internal training of new employees and to create consistent messages across websites, ads, and sales presentations.
Even better, each team now has detailed information and messages about the other businesses, empowering cross-selling and a deeper, more integrated partnership.
And most important, business and residential customers get seamless, fluid, connected capabilities presentation across the companies.

Lynxx Networks is an integrated communications, technology, and electrical service provider that connects people through modern, secure, and reliable networks. Intentionally focused on a specific local region, they bring a community focus and relationship-based interactions to effectively compete with national providers.
Key to their success is their end-to-end, integrated internet, voice, streaming, IT, electrical, and cabling solutions for businesses and residential customers. To make these services seamless, Lynxx brings together leading providers in each of their specialty areas. Lynxx Networks provides the efficiencies of a parent company while empowering specialized teams to run their divisions autonomously.
Now, they needed a centralized marketing and messaging resource to enable their teams to present their capabilities as a single provider of choice.
Lynxx Networks brings together three partner organizations. The Lynxx parent company provides business IT solutions, voice, and internet. Bahr Electric provides electrical and cabling infrastructure. And 3RT provides comprehensive IT managed services.
To enable unified yet distinct messaging across the partner organizations, the BizStream team conducted detailed stakeholder interviews, gaining rich insights—in particular from executives, SMEs and sales teams who touch the lives of their customers directly, every day.
From the data and insights we gathered, we crafted a comprehensive messaging document. The combined resource provides:

Modernizing Data Management and UX for an Industry-Leading Fluid Testing Provider
Founded in 1978, Petroleum Technologies provides complete fluid testing for many different markets and applications with a special focus on the transportation, off-highway, industrial, waste handling/landfill, marine, and power generation industries.
This project’s primary goal was to update Petroleum Technologies’ existing database application to a modern technology stack. The previous technology was outdated (MySQL) by approximately 20 years, causing many security concerns. Other goals included:
My experience with BizStream has been outstanding. They were easy to work with, quick turnaround time with our project, and their staff is very friendly. When any bugs or concerns about a feature came to the surface, they were quick to respond and went above and beyond to fix to our liking.
When we had to update our website and database, we needed to make something that was user-friendly, very responsive, and BizStream came through with excellence. Much of the improvements that they suggested have made our data entry and processing streamlined and simplified.

Visualizing Solar Impact with a Real-Time Dashboard
The BizStream Solar Dashboard is an internal project created to show the BizStream team the impact of our solar panels in terms of how much money is being saved and their positive effect on the environment through real-time data.
During a hackathon event, a team of one developer (Mark Schmidt) and one designer (Rex Rainey) challenged themselves to create a custom internal dashboard showing real-time data and historical stats from our rooftop solar panels.
Here are our stats as of this writing… and they’re increasing every day!
Ever since we had solar panels installed we wanted to do something interesting with the data we were collecting. So we harnessed our internal skills to put together a real-time dashboard that’s a useful and fun way to visualize the benefits we’ve gained since going solar.

Empowering Over 85 Schools with a Scalable, Multi-Site Digital Platform
National Heritage Academies (NHA) is a network of 85+ public charter schools serving more than 58,000 students in 9 states in the USA. NHA is the 4th largest for-profit education network in the USA.
Kentico Xperience Site of the Month
NHA needed assistance replacing its existing website, powered by legacy technologies, with an easy-to-use CMS that would allow many editors to make changes quickly and efficiently from the corporate office and multiple individual school administrations without needing technical expertise.
Like any large-scale project, there were challenges. This project was unique in that it required integration with numerous systems and technologies. BizStream and National Heritage Academies were able to tackle those challenges boldly, and Kentico handled our complex solution very well. Managing content on our sites has vastly improved, and mass edits and content validation has been streamlined due to our implementation of Kentico as our CMS.
BizStream provided a wealth of knowledge throughout the entire development and change management process. Because of the way National Heritage Academies chooses to do business, many teams and individuals are required to know how to use Kentico. BizStream was able to successfully deliver a feature-rich product and also provided us with insight into how to use Kentico. From a development standpoint, BizStream was willing and open to discussing their process and melding it with our own. This allowed us to share technical knowledge throughout the project lifecycle.

The Team Run Smart site refresh revitalized both reach and engagement. Visitors now enjoy faster, easier access to a wealth of resources designed to help them optimize their careers. The improved experience has led to stronger user involvement across the board.
We knew we were doing something different in agriculture, with no clear guide on how to develop our online presence. Right from the start, BizStream got on board with our vision—and quickly turned into trusted advisors.
Over a decade ago, American truck manufacturer Freightliner Trucks partnered with the financial and business consultant firm ATBS to create a website, Team Run Smart, that serves professional truck drivers across North America. To help truckers successfully operate a small business while maximizing drive time, the site enables members to share business, maintenance, and lifestyle advice for every stage of the trucking career path. The site was a massive success, but by 2019, Team Run Smart’s popularity had become a double-edged sword.
As its content library continued to grow, users found themselves increasingly frustrated by the site’s limited search functionality. The site’s navigation couldn’t keep up with its many blog posts and videos. And modern industry changes and challenges put truck drivers early on in their careers at a significant disadvantage—a topic absent from the site. For help, Freightliner turned to the site’s original strategy, design, and technical development team, now at BizStream.
To address usability challenges and better serve both new and returning visitors, the team implemented a range of strategic content and navigation enhancements. These solutions were designed to improve engagement, strengthen community ties, and attract a broader audience.

Uniting Former Competitors with a Lead-Generation Website
​Togetherwork is a leading provider of integrated software and financial solutions designed to empower communities and organizations across diverse sectors. Serving thousands of communities and millions of members worldwide, Togetherwork offers tailored tools that streamline operations, enhance member engagement, and simplify financial management.
List, List
Through a well-organized project plan and a highly transparent process, we delivered a focused, optimized site. Purposefully developed pages provide highly targeted information about Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce platform solutions while answering critical top-of-funnel questions.
A gated association software evaluation quiz acts as a lead magnet. And qualified leads are converted through direct requests to speak to sales advisors.
Now, these former rival companies can effectively share lead-capture resources—and as a result, both companies get better qualified leads that are further along in their decision-making process.
We knew we were doing something different in agriculture, with no clear guide on how to develop our online presence. Right from the start, BizStream got on board with our vision—and quickly turned into trusted advisors.
In the association management software (AMS) space, two leaders stand out: Protech and Fonteva. Both companies have developed association-tailored, all-in-one platform solutions—based in Microsoft 365 and Salesforce, respectively—to help associations run complex operations effectively and efficiently.
Now, under the collective Togetherwork brand, the two organizations find themselves in a collaborative (rather than competitive) sales space. BizStream had worked with both Protech and Fonteva on previous projects, and Togetherwork turned to us again to build a new, shared, lead-generation website.
This new site would capture potential customers high in the sales funnel and guide them to the solution that is most aligned with their unique needs.
Our website content and design process begins with a deep understanding of the target audience. To bring together the Protech and Fonteva worlds, we worked closely with SMEs from both companies to understand the information needs and decision drivers for association software teams who are seeking a new AMS. Then, we learned what those buyers would need to change their thinking—and embrace the idea of a full platform solution.
Our discovery and strategic planning were supplemented by revisiting existing Protech and Fonteva websites, resource centers, and brand assets. A substantial body of information already existed, and we aimed to complement those websites and resources, not replace them.
We focused on crafting a signature website that stands on its own to provide lead generation through:
As content development progressed, we selected a WordPress template and began creating the site architecture while our visual designer created the overarching look and feel for the site, its design, and aesthetics.
As part of the WordPress build, we strategically developed aspects that enable site adaptability. We ensured that the Togetherwork team can easily add content pillars and resource center assets to continue to reach their target audience.

Product-Led Success
InfinityQS is the leading provider of Statistical Process Control (SPC) software and services to manufacturers worldwide. With 40,000+ installed licenses currently in use, InfinityQS quality management solutions save leading manufacturers millions of dollars each year. Like many traditional software companies, InfinityQS is undergoing a digital transformation in an effort to modernize its offerings.
List, List
Our focused efforts paid off with the on-time and coordinated launch of all program elements and digital promotions for the Enact product-led subscription program. Within the first 3 weeks, InfinityQS had reached nearly 10% of their signup goal, with more than 50% of total signups coming organically from the newly optimized website. And the new product-led process was empowering customers by removing the risk and roadblocks involved in trying new software.
And, because product-led doesn’t mean hands-off, we put in place key metrics to enable ongoing monitoring of user signups, activation, and retention. A product-led approach isn’t right for every organization, but for InfinityQS, it was a logical next step in their product evolution.
The visual editor in Storyblok was the winner for us. Having a live preview gives our editors a powerful editing experience.
InfinityQS, a market leader in quality software for manufacturing, has always used a traditional, high-touch, consultative sales model. However, as they matured their cloud-based quality platform, Enact, they saw an opportunity to enable a new journey—one that puts customers in the driver’s seat and empowers them to gain meaningful value from the software faster.
A product-led, SaaS-based sales model would eliminate friction and risk, giving prospective customers:
To make the pivot happen within their incredibly tight timeframe—just three months from start to launch—InfinityQS turned to BizStream, a trusted partner who could drive momentum across all the moving parts and keep them on track to meet their incredibly tight timeframe.
Whether you’re pivoting from an existing sales model or launching a brand-new SaaS product, it’s critical to understand the end-to-end process that will keep you on track and help ensure a successful launch. As a full-service agency, BizStream has established processes that enable us to simultaneously manage multiple project elements.
InfinityQS realized they’d need to overhaul their entire customer startup experience—from messaging, website content, and SEO strategy to pricing, purchase, onboarding, and expansion pathways. And they’d need to re-imagine their internal and external processes along the way.
Coordinating our technical, content, marketing, and design teams with InfinityQS’s internal teams, we anchored the project by focusing first on essential, foundational elements: new company and product messaging, customer journey mapping, user experience design, and technology selection. With those elements in place, we could put teams to work blocking and tackling the website changes, microsite build, ecommerce integration, and site content revision and optimization.
Our technical experts leveraged existing knowledge to recommended technologies that would be cost- and time-effective to enable critical infrastructure. NetSuite enabled us to leverage InfinityQS’s legacy customer database while sharing key customer attributes with other systems. We paired Storyblok and Netlify to flexibly enable content management and hosting for the Enact Guided Learning microsite. User List provided the means to push nurtures, reminders, and prompts to new users, and User Pilot enabled an in-app messaging service for active Enact users.
At the same time, content marketing and design teams developed digital and social ad campaigns, built landing pages, rewrote site content, and created nurtures to ensure a connected user experience from first touch to conversion to onboarding.

Brand Revitalization: Refreshed Website to Support Account-based Marketing Efforts
InteliSecure offers Professional Services, Security Assessments, and Managed Services for data and threat protection.
2020 Fourteeners Silver Award: Brand and Digital Launch
With the support of BizStream’s adaptable experts, InteliSecure revitalized its brand and implemented a digital marketing strategy that was both impactful and budget-conscious. The refreshed approach not only amplified engagement but also significantly reduced the costs and effort required to generate and convert leads.
Going into the program, we were concerned about creating momentum quickly to demonstrate value to our board members. The strategic marketing plan helped us set a clear expectation for how we’d be using our allocated funds, and parallel workflows provided deliverables to show progress along the way.
InteliSecure is a provider of managed data protection services that incorporate vendor-partner software products. Historically focused on large, complex enterprises, the company’s growth strategy included a new audience: midsize companies. However, its traditional sales-focused approach was ill-equipped to market effectively to thousands of customers who had no previous exposure to the brand.
A digital marketing strategy was needed, but InteliSecure had no internal marketing staff. In addition to much-needed website and messaging updates, InteliSecure also required flexible, experienced marketing experts to help create a visionary, tactical strategy.
The company turned to BizStream—who interviewed InteliSecure subject matter experts and analyzed industry resources to create target personas and messaging. BizStream then built out an initial six-month marketing strategy that included a cross-channel digital campaign as well as a dual-track workflow for the creation of foundational brand and online elements. Content marketing included fresh blog content, email, and digital campaigns. These strategies and assets helped move InteliSecure’s brand forward, enabling internal staff to focus on specific growth and brand evolution goals.

BizStream also assisted BDO USA, LLP with migrating from their previous CMS to Kentico Xperience.
Working with BizStream has been a pleasure. Not only do they know the Kentico platform inside and out, but they also genuinely care about delivering the best solution possible. BizStream fully supported us through the early stages of the project, where we appreciated the detailed discovery sessions that BizStream led us through to get the requirements right. As the process continued and as our site was built, we liked their approach to sprint-based delivery and their ability to adapt to some of the last-minute details. That support was felt most as the final go-live of the site was met. Our stakeholders were extremely happy with the results. At each point, we felt we could count on BizStream, unlike other vendors we have encountered in the past.

Persona Research for Game-Changing Audience Understanding
The National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) is one of the largest student-governed organizations based in the United States. NSBE, founded in 1975, supports and promotes the aspirations of collegiate and pre-collegiate students and technical professionals in engineering and technology.
With more than 600 chapters and more than 24,000 active members in the U.S. and abroad, NSBE’s mission is to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.
List, List
Through the understanding NSBE gained from this research project, they can construct a map of the distinct journey prospective members and partners take to align with their organization.
And because they have a deeper understanding of their members, they can create conversations, both offline and online, from a position of empathy and strength, speaking to them with relevant content and in ways that inspire them to:
BizStream was great at listening and interpreting what we needed and how we worked as an organization to create custom solutions. They didn’t put us into a cookie-cutter option.
One of the largest student-governed organizations in the world, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), has empowered students and leaders in engineering and STEM fields with access to academics, peer support, and innovation since 1975.
As they approach their 50-year anniversary, NSBE has put in place a strategic plan for its ongoing evolution. A significant part of that strategy involves transforming their online presence to better serve their members and extended communities.
NSBE’s executive team recognized that to reach their strategic goals and get meaningful value from the changes they would make, they needed to start with a deeper understanding of the people at the heart of their service.
They turned to BizStream for a research project that would bring their membership a clear voice in the evolution of the society and guide future marketing and website changes.
BizStream designed an interview-centered research project to reach all of NSBE’s major stakeholder audiences and document key aspects of their relationship with the organization.
We structured the project around a phased process that would enable us to connect with a wide sample of stakeholders across multiple segments of the organization.
Our team worked closely with NSBE’s executive team to identify six member and influencer personas, then developed detailed questions for each persona segment.
NSBE provided contact lists and sent email outreach, and our team leveraged an online scheduling tool to automate interview setup. Over the course of 6 weeks, we conducted nearly 60 recorded interviews, and documented and analyzed interview and survey responses.
With an enormous amount of information in hand, our team set to work sifting and consolidating responses, taking care to include a full range of feedback and preserving interviewee voices in both summary statements and direct quotes.
For projects such as this one—designed to integrate with and inform further efforts—delivery never means “handoff.” We took the time to present our findings to NSBE’s team, provide context, and include recommendations for making the most of this valuable information.

Branding & Identity Services
Build a shared language that communicates your brand’s value, differentiators, and benefits to build trust, increase sales, and cement customer loyalty.
Every client has a story to tell, and it needs to come through in everything they do. Our creative team works closely with your internal team(s) to get to know the unique qualities of your company or organization, why you do what you do, and the needs of your target audience.
We then translate these qualities into custom visuals to tell your brand’s story through logo, color, typography, imagery, and other branded elements.
Refreshing an existing brand or creating a brand from the ground up takes careful planning, thoughtful discussion, and constant evaluation.
Our creative team works closely with your team to explain the branding process, work through its various steps, and create the best brand for your organization. The results will help establish your brand with a unique and differentiated position in your market, making it easier for your ideal customers to identify and choose your brand.
To create a unified, consistent, recognizable brand presence across touch points, we provide the assets needed to roll out your updated brand to your employees and customers.
We deliver all necessary branding files, assets, guidelines, and other documentation to help you take control of your brand moving forward.
A crucial aspect of our marketing evolution was to fully articulate the unique value of our solutions. We needed to understand why customers should—and ideally would—buy from us rather than one of our competitors. Otherwise, how would we be able to help prospects come to that same conclusion? By centering on the customer in this way, we were able to focus our resources on reaching the right audience, improving the likelihood of successful conversions.

BizStream’s Journey to Embracing DEI
In today’s dynamic world, acknowledging the depth that diversity contributes is essential. Each individual’s perspectives, molded by their life experiences, intricately weave into the vibrant fabric of our society, prompting a recognition of humanity’s multifaceted nature.
However, diversity alone doesn’t suffice; equity and inclusion stand equally crucial. Equity addresses historical inequalities and systemic biases, ensuring impartial access to opportunities, while inclusion actively values and integrates diverse voices, nurturing a sense of belonging and inspiring innovation.
Recognizing that diversity, equity, and inclusion extend beyond racial boundaries is also key. These principles collectively strive to dismantle barriers across intersecting identities, encompassing gender equality, diverse sexual orientations, accessible opportunities for individuals with disabilities, respect for varying cultural and religious practices, and alleviating socioeconomic disparities. Through promoting equity and cultivating genuine inclusion, we lay the foundation for a culture characterized by harmony and progress.
Achieving the intertwined objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion involves cultivating an environment that encourages open dialogue and embraces differing viewpoints. This ongoing journey entails inviting diverse perspectives and acknowledging dissenting ideas, fostering true inclusion that actively engages with mixed thoughts.
BizStream’s transformative journey towards DEI is rooted in a commitment to educate ourselves about the profound impact of diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team members and the organizational landscape. This educational pursuit transcends surface intentions and delves into understanding the fundamental principles that underpin these concepts, acknowledging their potential to shape a more inclusive and equitable future.
A pivotal stride was taken in 2022 when BizStream established its DEI committee. The committee’s mission and purpose are defined in our DEI Committee Charter as:
The BizStream Committee for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) will serve as a force for good within the company, within our local communities, and within the technology industry.
The DEI Committee exists to:
One responsibility of our DEI committee is to identify and coordinate educational opportunities, workshops, and training programs to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness among employees.
One pivotal contributor to our journey has been Sandy Harvey, MBA, CDP, of Exodus Consulting. Sandy played a central role in guiding us through the intricacies of DEI through her Diversity Awareness and Unconscious Bias workshops.
This interactive and reflective course led us to explore the multifaceted characteristics we all share beyond race and gender. It highlighted how diversity awareness has evolved from eliminating discrimination to promoting active inclusion. Through these sessions, we’ve understood that the more aware we are of these nuances, the better we can foster meaningful relationships.
Delving into the depths of unconscious or implicit biases, this workshop exposed the fact that everyone possesses such biases. The workshop showcased how these biases also manifest in our professional environments, potentially leading to unhealthy behaviors and exposing organizations to discrimination and harassment risks if unchecked.
Another contributor was Jessica Bacon, CRCR, who presented on weight biases in the workplace.
This workshop casts a spotlight on the influence of body size on workplace inclusivity. The discussion centered around the impact of body size discrimination, its potential implications for BizStream, and the significance of addressing this issue.
These workshops are pivotal milestones in BizStream’s ongoing journey towards creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace, embodying our commitment to continual growth and positive transformation.
Incorporating pronouns in communications, email signatures, Slack profiles, and team member profiles on our website goes beyond mere adjustments; it’s a meaningful step towards representation and respect for each individual’s gender identity. This practice fosters a welcoming environment and acknowledges the importance of recognizing and validating diverse identities within our team.
Beyond BizStream’s internal initiatives, we actively engage with and support local endeavors. This includes our partnerships like Change the Code, a student-led non-profit organization aimed at improving gender balance within the STEM industry, and our participation in Holland Pride, a pivotal event organized by Out on the Lakeshore. By participating in these events, celebrating women in STEM and the LGBTQ+ community, we manifest our unwavering commitment to catalyzing broader societal changes.
Additional DEI efforts include commemorating Juneteenth as a company holiday, accompanied by educational initiatives, recognizing and celebrating the significance of Pride Month, and participating in International Day of Pink, a worldwide anti-bullying and anti-homophobia event. We hope these actions convey our unwavering determination to cultivate an inclusive workplace that genuinely embraces the diverse backgrounds and identities of all team members and their diverse family members.
Embracing DEI isn’t just a checkbox for us; it’s a mindset that influences every facet of our company culture. We cherish each individual’s unique perspective and are committed to treating everyone with the same compassion and respect we expect for ourselves. By creating an equitable and inclusive workspace, we strive to foster an environment where every individual can flourish.
The journey isn’t a one-time achievement; it’s an ongoing commitment to fostering diversity, inclusivity, equity, and respect. We’re dedicated to learning, growing, and continuously improving as we work towards creating a more just and harmonious world for everyone.

Our History
Well, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm’s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.
Many may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.
As we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream! 
In 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn’t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting …
Visit the NoWaterBall site
To accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!
The GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream’s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!
In 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!
Remember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.
In 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!
BizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn’t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they’ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.
This program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to BizStream Academy and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
In 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer’s loft with a firefighter’s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!
In 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal’s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream’s unique company structure.
Read the 40 Under Forty – 2014 – Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
Our implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico’s 1,000+ global partners!
Over seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!
In 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by Michigan Celebrates Small Business!
The theme for the year was ‘Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs’ and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.
BizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico’s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!
In 2018, we were recognized as a National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For® winner! We’ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!
In 2019, it was Brian’s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.
Read the 40 Under 40 – Business Leaders – 2019 – Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
With the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.
In 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!
In 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!
Now that we’re officially 21, we’ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We’ve come a long way over the years – from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services – whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
It’s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!
In 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!
In 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions—laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.

Mark Schmidt
Our motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.
The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that’s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU’s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I’d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.
After GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.
With a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That’s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don’t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That’s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.
At BizStream, we’ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it’s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be cliché, but it’s true — we work hard and we play hard.
I’ve found that if you’re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people’s shoes, and I’m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don’t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don’t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren’t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.
The reason BizStream’s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn’t want to work at a typical job. That doesn’t mean I didn’t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let’s make it something we want to do.
This mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We’ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).
In addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College’s computer sciences department. It’s really cool because I’m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.
When I’m not working, I’m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I’m not at work, I’m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I’ve done a lot of home automation, and I’m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.
Work is such a big part of most everyone’s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.
There’s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” That’s where it’s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren’t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.

I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
I joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn’t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.
That same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.
I went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).
I was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
We have a group of like-minded people here. There’s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I’m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it. When people think it can’t be done, we’ve done it.
I love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It’s what I’d do even if BizStream didn’t exist. What we do at BizStream isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s challenging, sure, but I couldn’t be in a job that wasn’t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.
It also makes me happy that we’ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the BizStream Academy — a program where we offer development training for students — and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.
I work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work, which is one of the great things about BizStream — the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I’m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.
When I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),  and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy. I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico’s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world. When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.
As a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don’t care that it’s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but I was learning what “whatever it takes” really means.
I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I’ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I’m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I’ve never met a Roulette table I didn’t like.

Cory VandenBout
In 2006, I came on at BizStream. I got an interview, was hired on as a junior developer, and over time made my way to the top as a senior developer and technical lead. I’ve been around long enough to really see the company change and grow.
Most of my life has been spent in the West Michigan area — Jenison, Allendale, Grand Rapids, and now Rockford, with a brief stint in Fort Lauderdale.
I graduated from Grand Valley State University in 2003, and went on to work at a mortgage company in IT for a year and a half. After a year and a half I was transferred down to the Fort Lauderdale branch. I stayed for more than a year, and it was definitely a great experience, but I eventually made my way back to Michigan.
In 2006, I came on at BizStream. I got an interview, was hired on as a junior developer, and over time made my way to the top as a senior developer and technical lead. I’ve been around long enough to really see the company change and grow.
BizStream isn’t a typical office. There’s no bureaucracy or red tape to get stuff done. If you have an idea, you can start and run with it. We’re pretty open to new things and to changing things for the better. No one here is stuck in their ways.
The atmosphere here is pretty laid back. Everyone’s great — we’re all friends. We’re all kind of similar in the way we think about work and life. Here, work isn’t the thing you have to go to every day; it’s a place you get to go to.
Traveling is something I’d like to do more. As a kid, my family traveled all over America. Later in life, I’ve gone to Jamaica, London, and honeymooned in Paris and Cannes, France. I would like to go back to London. I like the idea of being in a foreign country without a language barrier. You get to see a different culture, but don’t feel walled off from everyone. I also want to go to Hawaii, Italy, Iceland, and maybe the Netherlands would be cool too. Oh, and to New Zealand to see the Lord of the Rings sets.
Since I’ve been out in the real world, I’ve learned that patience with new technology is essential. That old Yoda quote inspires me to hang in there when I’m figuring out stuff: “Do or do not. There is no try.”

Mike Kren
Mike has been managing large-scale projects for the better part of the last 11 years. His passion is bringing order to the chaos to keep everyone on the same page and the work moving forward.
I have been managing large-scale projects since 2006 and am a certified Project Manager and Scrum Master. I came to BizStream in August of 2015, and to be honest, I didn’t have much of a background in developing websites at that time. However, organizing, solving problems, and helping people figure out how to work together is my passion. I wear many hats as the Head of Operations, a Team Lead, and a Project Manager. Due to this, my primary role changes day-to-day.
One thing I have discovered since I have been here is that I also love finding great people to come work with us. Our people make up most of our great culture, so it is truly awesome sharing it with others and helping them see if they would be a good fit and know that they can contribute to our culture immediately. One thing I have found to be true since day one is that BizStream is the kind of company that I would have built given the opportunity. Everyone here is empowered to make a difference.
My background is actually in Communications. I graduated from GVSU with a film degree and spent the first several years of my career in the video production industry. It was there that I first learned about producing and project management and found I might have a knack for it. I’ve also found that working in the web world is not that different from the video world. I’ve been managing people since I was 18. I’ve had various managing positions since then, learning a lot as I go. I’ve found that managing people can be one of the most rewarding and most challenging parts of my job, but I wouldn’t change a thing.
When I’m not working, I love spending time with my wife, four kids, and dog. I absolutely love movies of all kinds. Blockbusters, foreign films, cult classics, etc. You name it; I’ll check it out. I also love cooking, backpacking, camping, and working out.

BizStream Recognized on Inc. 5000 List for Second Time
For the second time, BizStream makes the Inc. 5000, at no. 3,921 in 2024, with three-year revenue growth of 117%!
ALLENDALE, MI, August 13, 2024 – Inc. revealed today that BizStream ranks No. 3,921 on the 2024 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.
We’re thrilled to be recognized on the Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. This honor reflects the dedication, innovation, and hard work of our amazing team. Our growth comes from strong relationships with our clients and our commitment to delivering services and products that meet their evolving needs. We’re excited to keep moving forward and are grateful for the support of our clients, partners, and incredible team.
The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.
Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, location, and other criteria, go to inc.com/inc5000. All 5000 companies are featured on Inc.com starting Tuesday, August 13, and the top 500 appear in the new issue of Inc. magazine, available on newsstands beginning Tuesday, August 20.
One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list. To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.
Companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2020. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2023. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2020 is $100,000; the minimum for 2023 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places.

BizStream Is a GREAT Place to Work, but It’s NOT for Everyone
When BizStream started in 2001 it was small and made up of mostly friends and family. We were all on the same page and everyone knew what BizStream was about. But as we grew and as we brought on more people, we slowly began to realize that maybe our vision wasn’t being seen by everyone. The “BizStream way” was becoming blurred. As much as we hate to have a bunch of rules in place and things in writing, it became pretty clear that if we wanted to keep our unique culture and [kick-ass] work ethic, that we needed to lay it out in black and white for our people. Because, as much as we aren’t about a bunch of rules, we are about complete transparency, setting our team up for success, and keeping BizStream an awesome place to work for hard-working people. As our team continues to grow we want to make sure we’re bringing people on that are a great fit for BizStream, and on the flip side, that they can somewhat easily determine if this is a place that they want to be a part of before they even walk into an interview with us.
It became pretty apparent that we needed to do a few things:
The first thing our leadership team wanted to define was BizStream’s Core Focus. We started by asking ourselves questions like, “Why do we get up in the morning? Why does BizStream exist?” And after a fairly quick discussion, most of us came to a very similar reason. We finalized our Core Focus as:
We feel it really hits the nail on the head. We love technology, we love building cool things and we also know that the majority of our waking hours are spent at work. So, if we are spending that much time at work, we better enjoy it. We believe it is our team that makes us WANT to come to work versus the majority of the workforce, that DREADS coming to work. I’ve said it in the past, “I want to go to work every day and write code with my friends”, that’s why I started BizStream, and it’s really important to me that we keep it that way. The last part of our core focus, “have a positive impact on others” is because Brian (co-founder) and I want to work with people that are not just here for themselves. It’s a big world out there and we strongly feel one of the best things we can do as a human is to positively impact as many other people as possible. It also means doing as much in the community as we can. This is why many of us at BizStream are coaches, scoutmasters, youth group leaders, robotics team advisers, BizStream Academy mentors and so much more. Many of us especially love working with youth, education, and technology.
Now it was time to define what we do, what we are the best at, how we are unique, and the kind of projects we excel at.  We’ve always excelled in using software to find solutions to unique, complicated problems. It’s what we love to do. Our team gets excited from digging into complex issues and discovering new ways to solve them with programming. One of the common phrases you’ll hear around here is “We are experts in things we’ve never done before”. Of course, that only refers to the world of programming. I wouldn’t ask our team members to land a 747 or do brain surgery. But when it comes to programming and complex integrations, “we got this”. After all that, we landed with this as our niche:
We enjoy working on the hard stuff. We love it when we hear that a different vendor told the client that “it’s impossible, or too complex, or just too hard”… hah! Bring it on. We aren’t really into making yet another simple, static brochure site that has nothing complicated going on in it. However, if it is e-commerce, multilingual, multi-site, tapping into multiple 3rd-party APIs, pulling data from an ERP, CRM or 10 other systems … our ears are perking up, and we are already thinking about possible solutions to propose to the client. These are the types of projects that our processes and teams are optimized for. Honestly, we are overkill for the smaller, simpler problems that Wix or Square Space are much better suited for.
Our niche not only explains what we specialize in, but it also highlights what we DON’T do. We are very much the IMPLEMENTERS of a project. Already have a great design agency or marketing department, or you want to use one of our design resources? Great! We have worked with many scenarios where we leverage our internal resources as well as external resources that specialize in high-end design, graphic artistry, content writing, marketing strategies, and UX, and we know how to implement their concepts and bring them to life. We know enough to know how to implement a good marketing strategy, but we are not the ones that will come up with it from scratch.
The last step for us was to define our Core Values. While we’ve always lived by these values, we never actually stopped to take the time to really think about them and put them down on paper. It was a great experience to think about each of our team members and clearly define which qualities and characteristics stood out. We pretty much laid out the model of what we wanted all future employees to look like. So, these are the Core Values that our team lives and breathes:
Update October 2021 – I’ve recently realized two of our core values, whatever it takes and work hard, play hard, have picked up some negative connotations within the industry, so I wanted to clarify what these 20-year-old core values really mean to Team BizStream.
What it may mean to other companies: At some companies, whatever it takes means literally doing whatever it takes to accomplish a task, complete a project, or land a big sale. This may mean working long hours at the expense of time with your friends and family, sacrificing your mental health, or doing things you’re morally uncomfortable doing.
What it means to BizStream: At BizStream, however, whatever it takes means going above and beyond for the good of the team because we are stronger when we work together than we are working with only our own interests or our own projects in mind. We don’t want anyone getting left behind. It’s not just at the employee level either. Whatever it takes means the owners take care of our employees, their families, and our communities. Leadership will do whatever it takes to ensure our team members have what they need to succeed – extra help on a project, a last-minute mental health day, maybe even an advanced HSA payment when unexpected medical issues arise. When we do whatever it takes for each other, we are a stronger unit. Whatever it takes also means that our clients are well taken care of. To us, it’s not always about the bottom line. Yes, we are a business; we need to make money, but giving a little extra here and there is ok too, especially if it is impactful to our client.
What it may mean to other companies: Your boss expects a 60-hour workweek out of you while they frequently head out of the office early. You have an extremely stressful deadline, but your leadership team is nowhere to be found and leaves you feeling unsupported. YOU work hard, while THEY play hard. Does that sound familiar to you?
What it means to BizStream: At BizStream, work hard, play hard doesn’t mean working long hours. Actually, if our managers see one of their team members consistently putting in more than 45 hours a week, they will meet with that team member to understand why and make a plan to them get back to their standard 40-42 hours. We make it a point to monitor hours for many reasons – One, we want our people to spend their non-working time with their friends and family and hobbies. Two, we want to avoid burnout and unneeded stress.
Nevertheless, we expect our team to put in a SOLID, productive 40 hours (not a half-assed 40); that’s what work hard means at BizStream. We don’t want our people spending 60 hours at work where 20 of those hours are unproductive. At BizStream, we take on challenging projects with tight timelines. So when our team is on the clock, it is GO TIME. The owners and the leadership team live and breathe a strong work ethic, and we expect the same from the rest of our team. We like to get stuff done. When our whole team is working hard, we are unstoppable and can accomplish anything, including having a fun environment. Our play hard time is just as important to us (a quick foosball match, organized social hours, office parties & outings, etc.) because it allows our team to decompress and get to know each other on a personal level. I believe our team works better when they are confident that everyone is pulling their weight; It also makes our playtime that much sweeter – because the team knows we all crushed it to make our fun times happen. Because of this, I believe working hard and playing hard go hand in hand.
Now back to the original post…
Shout out to a local dev shop in Grand Rapids, MI Atomic Object. While we have Care as one of our main core value, one of our sub-points of Care is “Give a shit”, which is one of AO’s values that we’ve always admired. We tried and tried to word it differently, but the statement “Give a shit” is just so perfect and true. AO is another company with great Core Values.
I want to make it clear that although we’re all following the same core values, this doesn’t mean we lose our individuality. There is a ton (some would argue too much) of individuality at BizStream. We all have different backgrounds and ideas. But with all of us following the core values, we know we are a team, and we truly care about each person on our team and the work that we deliver to our clients. Having core values allows us to take a step back and ask ourselves if what we’re doing is in line with the BizStream Core Values and Focus. Essentially, for the greater good of the company. If it’s not, we need to re-think what we’re doing and how we’re doing it. We can have very strong yet healthy discussions and still come up with great solutions because we are not afraid to say our viewpoint or disagree with someone else’s. It’s all good, as long as it’s done in a positive and constructive way.
It has been an amazing experience to be a part of BizStream as we have begun to solidify the concept of “this is who we are!” The values have always been there, back to when BizStream was made up of only two people. Now we are integrating core values into every aspect of BizStream and using them to take BizStream to the next level. It takes the right kind of person to not only survive but also thrive at BizStream. Defining these core values will do just that to keep BizStream a great place to work.
Okay, so, if you are reading this blog post, and you are interested in working at BizStream, here is the part where I am going to try to scare some of you off.
If you are the type that wants to come to work, punch in their 40 hours, and never think about work during your off time, that is great … but you probably won’t fit in well at BizStream. There are plenty of jobs out there where you can do that, just not here. Part of BizStream’s DNA is to do Whatever it Takes, Work Hard and Play Hard, Be a Team and Care. So, that means, after-hours or on the weekends, we might be hanging out together doing something cool, or working out together at the local CrossFit gym, helping someone out at their house, or occasionally staying a little late at the office to get something done. You’ll also find a lot of us doing community work or volunteering to teach kids how to code. But we’re doing that because we care and because … we give a shit.If you follow our social media, you’ve probably noticed that we have a ton of fun. Because we DO Play Hard here. From parties (while most other companies are working) to having mini coolers all throughout the office stocked with microbrews, to team backpacking trips, and a ton more. We have a lot of fun. But the flip side to that is when we are working, we work really hard. If you are the type that likes to go to work, and kind of pretend like you are working, do half social media, news, online shopping, chatting, whatever other non-working stuff and half kinda pretend you are working … you are going to stand out like a sore thumb and BizStream is going to be very uncomfortable for you.
We do this job because we love it. Those of us that are programmers love programming, we talk about at work on the clock and off the clock. We are always looking for the next new thing. Is every project in the building the most exciting thing in the world to work on? No. But do we make the best of it, and try to balance the fun, cool technologies with the older, legacy stuff? Yes. And it’s not just our programmers. This mindset carries on throughout our QA, PM, Marketing, Sales, and IT teams.
We’ve spent a lot of time recently re-visiting why BizStream was started in the first place and how to keep it that way. BizStream was and will always be a place where awesome people come to do kick-ass work, celebrate their accomplishments, and help others along the way. Not everyone is into that style of work, and that’s okay. They just aren’t for us, and hopefully, now we (BizStream) and the person interested in the job can realize that much sooner, saving everyone time and frustrations. The team members who are a great fit for BizStream now have everything laid out for them; core focus, niche, and core values. They can apply any or all of those ideas in their day-to-day to help them be the best they can be at BizStream, which helps BizStream be the best it can be.

4 Tips for Maximizing Your Internship Experience
If you’re embarking on an internship and uncertain about what to anticipate, you’re not alone. In this blog post, I will share some valuable insights I gained as an intern at BizStream. Whether you’re about to start your internship or are planning to pursue one in the future, the tips I’ll be covering can help you make the most of your experience.
Every company has a different culture, so it’s important to know what sort of culture you may be getting involved in. One way you can get a glimpse of that culture is by taking a look at their social media posts. It’s not uncommon for companies to post fun things they do, but that is often just a small glimpse into the company. Another effective approach to gaining insight into a company’s culture and other important details is to review its website. By exploring a company’s website, you can gain valuable information on its values, work environment, dress code, and more. It’s important to note that neglecting to visit a company’s website before an interview or expressing interest in an internship may send the message that you haven’t done your research and lack a genuine interest in the organization. Another effective way to get a feel for the company’s culture is to participate in company events whenever possible. I fell in love with BizStream’s unique culture through everyday experiences and events like our annual golf outing and camping trip.
It’s important to remember that not every company is the same. By learning about the company’s culture, interns can navigate their roles and interactions with colleagues more effectively, ultimately leading to a more successful internship experience.
Internships are a learning experience. Companies invest in interns to help them gain valuable knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields. This is the time for you to explore the working world and see how it relates to your education and career expectations. Your internship may exceed your expectations or fall short, but the focus should be on learning. Most of your learning will occur through everyday tasks, but don’t be afraid to ask your colleagues for recommendations on additional resources such as books, videos, or articles to expand your knowledge.
At BizStream, we embrace our core value of Foster Growth in Others, so our team is always willing to lend a helping hand. So when I encountered a challenge or needed assistance, I spoke up and asked for help. This proved extremely helpful for me both during my internship and now as a web developer.
During your internship, you’ll have the opportunity to work alongside professionals who have been in your field for years. These individuals have a wealth of knowledge and experience you can learn from. Take the initiative to learn from them by asking questions about their experiences and career paths. You may be surprised at the valuable insights they can provide.
By learning about their experiences, you can gain insight into the history of your field and what changes have occurred over the years. This knowledge can help you better understand the industry and its trends, which can be valuable as you progress in your own career.
Finally, your co-workers may have insights and advice that can help you have the most positive experience during your internship. For example, they may be able to offer guidance on how to navigate challenges or how to make the most of your time in the company. Don’t be afraid to ask for their opinions and recommendations—their input can be extremely valuable.
In my experience, internships are relatively low-pressure situations. Although you will have some responsibilities and general expectations to fulfill, you can still enjoy yourself by finding ways to have fun with the tasks at hand. If you are passionate about the field, focus on learning as much as possible and finding enjoyment in your work. Looking back on your internship, you will likely find that it provided you with more benefits than you would have received from treating it solely as a class required for your degree.
In 2016, I enrolled in the BizStream Academy coding bootcamp, which proved to be a game-changer for me. Thanks to the skills I acquired through the program, I later secured an internship with BizStream in 2022, eventually leading to a full-time position in 2023. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in coding and based in West Michigan. It’s an excellent opportunity to gain valuable skills and potentially open doors to exciting career opportunities!
While each intern’s experience may be different, these useful tips can help you make the most of your time as an intern by acquiring valuable skills, enjoying your work, and cultivating a strong work ethic. It’s important to keep in mind that your internship may lead to a job opportunity (as mine did), so it’s crucial to maintain a balance between having fun and demonstrating a strong work ethic. By following these tips and staying committed to your goals, you can maximize your internship experience and set yourself up for success in your future career. So, go ahead and embrace your internship experience with confidence and enthusiasm!

Why Working at a Digital Agency is Great for Junior Developers
As a self-taught developer who transitioned from a career in healthcare, I know firsthand how challenging it is to be new to the tech industry. However, working for a digital agency like BizStream has provided me with numerous advantages and opportunities to grow as a developer. Since starting as an intern in October 2022, I have progressed to a junior developer and learned so much from working alongside a diverse team of experts. In this blog post, I’ll explore some of the many benefits of working for a digital agency such as BizStream and how it can help new developers like myself gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals.
One major advantage of working for a digital agency like BizStream is the opportunity to work with a diverse team of experts with a wide range of skill sets. This allows new developers to expand their knowledge and experience in different areas of digital development, including branding, web design, web development, digital strategy, consulting, CMS platform selection, and more. No two projects are the same, and it is incredibly convenient for new developers to have access to a variety of experts within the agency to ask questions and get quick, detailed answers. Having immediate access decreases the amount of time spent muddling through projects and ensures that the work being produced is of high quality. It also helps to streamline communication with clients, as there is no need to send a chain of emails back and forth between the agency and an outside team. As a result, the agency can respond to clients quickly and efficiently, delivering projects on time and within budget.
Furthermore, working with an agency allows new developers to experience a coordinated approach to online strategy. At BizStream, for example, the entire team assigned to each project is privy to the consulting, design, and spin-up processes. By doing this, expectations are shared early on, and there is minimal room for deviation. This approach ensures that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goals and is aware of the different pieces that make up the whole. It also helps new developers gain a deeper understanding of the impact of their work and the importance of collaboration across different teams.
In addition to the above, digital agency can provide new developers with the opportunity to work on a variety of projects for different clients. As a result, junior developers are able to build a diverse portfolio and develop their skills in different areas. Working on various projects also allows new developers to learn from experienced developers who can provide mentorship and guidance. This can help new developers improve their skills and develop professionally. Since joining the team at BizStream, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a range of diverse projects, including developing a website for a non-profit hospital system, updating an ecommerce site, building a water sample data reporting site, and will soon be working on an agricultural product and education site. As a junior developer, I am overjoyed by my expanding portfolio and know it is something that I would have struggled to achieve on my own and on this scale.
Another benefit of working for an agency is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. At BizStream, for example, new developers are constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, such as headless CMS, serverless architecture, and AI/machine learning. With that being the case, we are able to stay ahead of the curve and develop skills that are in high demand in the industry.
Working for digital agency can also provide new developers with opportunities for career growth and advancement. For example, at BizStream, new developers can take on increasing levels of responsibility as they gain experience and prove themselves capable. They can also move into different areas of the agency, such as project management or business development, if they have an interest in those areas.
Finally, working for an agency can give new developers a sense of community and belonging. At BizStream, there is a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, with regular team-building events and opportunities for socializing outside of work. This helps new developers feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves and can help them build lasting relationships with their colleagues.
Working for a digital agency like BizStream can provide new developers with a wide range of benefits, including exposure to a diverse team of experts, a coordinated approach to online strategy, the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, mentorship, guidance from experienced developers, the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, opportunities for career growth, and a sense of community and belonging. These benefits can help new developers gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals while enjoying their job.

Why Marketers and Developers Are Turning to Headless CMS for Better User Experiences
Content is the linchpin that connects you to your customers. In a world where people consume content on multiple devices and in many formats, ensuring a great experience is critical.
A headless content management system (CMS) can be a powerful solution—not only for your users, but also for marketers and developers supporting content creation and development.
By separating the back end from the front end, headless CMS can transform the way users experience your content—and the way companies approach content development.
Read on to learn why a headless CMS might be a smart choice for organizations aiming to streamline content delivery across multiple platforms.
The most important thing to know about a headless CMS is that it separates the creation and storage of content (back end) from the presentation and delivery (front end). Known as “decoupled” architecture, this approach can offer superior flexibility, scalability, site speed, and security.
Unlike a traditional CMS, where content is tied to a pre-set theme, a headless CMS delivers it through Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs).
Key takeaway: A headless CMS stores and manages your content, while a presentation tool (website or mobile app) presents the content.
This structure may make it easier to manage, deliver, and repurpose your content to match the omnichannel environment your customers use.
To support the best possible delivery of content across a variety of formats, the headless approach involves creating modular content components that can be deployed to any type of front end. For example, suppose you’re creating a web page that includes:
With a traditional CMS, you might break out a couple of these items in separate entry fields, but more likely, you’d just lay them out all together in a single content object using a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor.
A headless system, such as Storyblok or similar platforms, breaks these components down even further and doesn’t mix content, layout, and design—keeping the end display more flexible:
The CMS enables you to specify which of these pieces should link with others by adding tags and taxonomy notations to each item.
With this information, developers can use programmatic APIs to pull the content into a variety of front ends. The results can be more adaptable and reusable than a big block of content designed for a static webpage shoehorned into other formats.
A traditional, monolithic CMS may feel limiting depending on project goals or complexity. Its architecture can sometimes create workflow bottlenecks or reduce flexibility.
Common challenges include:
As a marketer, you need to get campaigns off the ground fast. A headless CMS’ centralized content repository can make it easier to create content once and publish it across multiple channels—often with less reliance on development teams.
If you choose a headless CMS with a visual editor, like Storyblok or other similar platforms, your content creators can preview website changes in real time.
A headless approach can also offer advantages in content strategy. Thinking about content in modular, reusable chunks helps tighten messaging and lead users toward a clear outcome.
It encourages deeper content evaluation:
This more granular approach can support improved taxonomy, tagging, and reuse—benefiting both users and marketers.
Because a headless CMS separates the back end from the front end, developers can work with the technologies they prefer. In contrast, traditional CMS platforms may restrict your programming language or integration options.

Rise Above the Noise: Tell Your Members a Better Value Story
Competition is fierce. Members used to see associations as the exclusive, trusted source of information and connection.
Now, information is everywhere online. And it’s never been easier to access sources that appear authoritative (we’re looking at you, ChatGPT), but ultimately lack depth.
The good news? There’s opportunity. If you can tell a clear, convincing story for why your association is worth the cost—and support that story with a modern website—you can rise above the noise.
Once again, your association will be seen as the go-to source for insights, experience, and leadership no other online source can match.
Associations leverage multiple channels to tell their story (both on and offline). But how often do you audit those channels to ensure your message is consistent, clear, and relevant to your audience? When was the last time you spoke at length with customers to understand what motivates them?
It’s likely you need to revisit two core elements that comprise your brand story.
Interviewing members helps you understand the value they derive from your organization and what trends are influencing their behavior.
If you collect the right insights, you’ll have what you need to craft a brand story that identifies what they truly want and how your association can help get them there. That enables you to craft a compelling narrative where your member is the hero, and you are the trusted guide. If they want to overcome their challenges and ultimately realize a better version of themselves, then they need what only you can provide.
Through your persona development work, identify places on your website that really matter to your members and ensure the value proposition is strong.
For example, an association that offers certifications should describe how earning accreditation can boost a member’s career. Or, if you’re an organization with a social-driven mission, make it clear how your members can participate and drive your mission forward.
Once you have a solid grasp of your audience, develop a brand guide. This guide will serve as the source of truth for all team members to share a story that resonates with members in a consistent and clear way—no matter the channel.
It’s time to carry the brand guide’s core messaging across your website and communication channels.
Remember, stories must always move the reader forward. How does that happen from a brand perspective? Three components must be present: great user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and information architecture (IA).
Start with detailed user journey mapping. This will help you create a sitemap that informs your navigation, making it clear and easy for users to find the information they are looking for.
Surfacing content that’s meaningful is another integral part of keeping visitors engaged. Fortunately, an AI tool such as Algolia Recommends, makes this easy by leveraging live site and user data to enable advanced search capabilities.
Change is inevitable. How quickly and easily your systems adapt makes all the difference in managing your association’s story.
Many organizations use rigid content management systems (CMS) that slow down content updates and require frequent developer involvement.
Modern CMS solutions—whether headless, hybrid, or modular—offer greater flexibility, faster workflows, and intuitive editing experiences for non-technical users. They also integrate seamlessly with your existing tools, from member management systems to marketing platforms.
At BizStream, one of our specialties is helping organizations choose and implement the right CMS solution to meet their unique needs—helping build a digital ecosystem that’s agile, scalable, and ready for whatever comes next.
But building a modern digital experience isn’t just about technology—it’s about telling a story that sets your association apart. Partnering with an experienced team like BizStream ensures your website not only works better, but also tells your story in a way that resonates.
Ready to rediscover the story that captivates your members? Let’s talk.

Helping Associations Build Inclusive Digital Experiences: Join BizStream at CSAE’s Upcoming Webinar
Creating inclusive digital experiences is no longer a nice-to-have—it’s essential for associations striving to serve diverse audiences effectively. That’s why BizStream is excited to partner with the Colorado Society of Association Executives (CSAE) for an upcoming webinar focused on web accessibility. On April 24, join Rob Bean of BizStream and Kelly Jan of Recite Me as they share practical strategies to help associations move beyond compliance and build websites that are truly inclusive.
Date: Thursday, April 24thTime: 10:00–11:00 AM Mountain Time
For mission-driven organizations, accessibility isn’t just about compliance with a standard or mandate. It’s about creating an inclusive experience for all visitors. Additionally, inclusivity should go beyond simply meeting the letter of a mandate and instead look for ways to provide better access to information and resources for members and other stakeholders.
New technology can broaden accessibility support online by automatically providing language translation for the content on your website, including documents posted online. Furthermore, these technologies can also provide the ability for the site to read the information aloud to the visitor which is important for non-English speakers or for those with reading comprehension difficulty.
But even as your association works to bring your website into compliance with Federal and State accessibility mandates, you’re likely learning about emerging litigation and lawmaking from state, federal, and global agencies that will continue to affect you.
How can you keep up, stay in compliance, and truly meet the needs of your site users?In this practical webinar, you’ll learn where to start—and how to develop a sustainable approach to accessibility governance for your website.
Rob specializes in helping associations build better website experiences through a thoughtful application of strategy, creativity, and technology. He has generated great results for organizations such as CSU College of Business, Investments & Wealth Institute, the National Society of Black Engineers, The American Society for Non-Destructive Testing, and Western Research Institute.
Kelly specializes in fostering inclusivity across digital platforms. With a keen understanding of the importance of accessibility, she assists organizations nationwide in creating digital environments that embrace diversity. Her commitment to inclusivity extends beyond her professional endeavors, as she actively engages in advocacy efforts and stays abreast of the latest advancements in accessibility technology. Through her work, Kelly is a driving force in paving the way towards a more inclusive digital landscape.

Breadth vs. Depth: Which Learning Path Should You Take?
As a developer, continuous learning is more or less part of the job. Because our field is relatively new compared to the majority of other professions out there, the landscape of software development is always changing. It seems like every day, there’s a new language or framework or a new tool that claims to improve your efficiency to the point that you can become the elusive “10x developer” (read more about that in our blog post, Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status).
Due to this, it can be really difficult to keep up with the times if you’re not making a conscious effort to grow your skills and knowledge in this space. As of writing this, I have nearly 9 years of professional development experience. So, even though I’m not exactly a seasoned veteran yet, I do feel I have a pretty good grasp on what has and hasn’t paid off for me when it comes to the learning efforts I’ve put in outside of work, and I hope to share some of those learnings with you.
An obvious place to focus your learning efforts would be the same tech you use daily at whatever company you work for. Staying within the scope of what you work with on a regular basis provides a great way to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the types of things you use and run into frequently. This is especially valuable when starting out as a developer or transitioning to a new stack.On the flip side, sticking to only learning things you are already familiar with can limit your growth as a developer. Deepening your knowledge in a particular area is beneficial, but eventually, you’ll start to hit a threshold where the time you’re investing in learning more and more about it is less and less helpful. You basically run into a situation where you’re getting diminishing returns on your time investment.
A less obvious but very beneficial path would be learning things that you don’t use that often (or at all) at your work. This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but there are a handful of benefits to looking outside your norm when it comes to learning on your own time.First, learning outside the scope of your daily work can be a great source of new and fresh ideas for tackling different scenarios that might come up from time to time. Whether that be a new language or something like a new approach to automated deployments, the things you learn along the way can influence your approach to the problems you face at work, even if you never plan to use the exact same technologies.Secondly, depending on how variable your work environment is, there’s also the possibility that the things you’ve learned on the side might become directly applicable to a project you end up taking on at work. This comes down to random chance, unfortunately, if you don’t get much say in how your organization works, but if you have the ability to share your thoughts and ideas to change the direction of technology adoption, then this is a great way to test out new stuff and potentially get your organization to move to something new. (Disclaimer: just because something is new doesn’t make it better)
As mentioned earlier, I wanted to share some of my own experiences to shed some light on this topic. Below are some recent examples of how my learnings outside the typical BizStream stack have paid off for me.
Since BizStream has primarily been a .NET shop since its inception, pretty much every project I’ve been on in the past has been hosted in a Windows environment. Whether that be On-Prem with IIS or in Azure App Services, that’s the world I’ve been most familiar with over the past seven years, and it’s what I would default to when hosting my personal projects that I had built outside of work.
However, a little while ago, when I started on my journey with Vim (read my previous blog post, Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim), I realized that Docker runs so much better on Linux. I really started to enjoy working with Linux-based systems. This led me to want to start using Docker on all my personal projects and host them on a Linux VM running Ubuntu.
All the experience that I was gaining from changing up my hosting approach wasn’t being directly used at BizStream for quite some time; it was really just me having fun trying something new.
But recently, with .NET Core becoming increasingly widely used (especially for us now that we’re doing Xperience by Kentico projects), our ongoing efforts to provide headless CMS options, and Next.js being a top contender for those types of projects, there’s been a lot more opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge I’ve built up in this area.
A recent example of all of this coming in handy was when we needed to help get a site deployed to a Linux VM that didn’t have any prior CI/CD setup, just a Dockerfile in the root of the repo and a docker-compose.yml file on the server. Hopefully, you can see where this is going…
I was able to help out due to the knowledge I had built up on my personal time. This made it so we didn’t have to re-platform them over to another hosting solution, which would’ve been a much bigger lift when they just needed a deployment to fix some issues on their site. I even got to use my Vim skills when we needed to make some small tweaks to the docker-compose.yml file as part of our changes.
For the entirety of my professional development career, my work has been with high-level languages like C# and Javascript, and the lowest-level language I’ve ever worked with was a C++ class back in college. This past December I decided I would attempt to see how far I could get in the Advent of Code challenge with all my solutions being written in C.I unfortunately didn’t get to devote as much time to this as I had hoped, but I still managed to solve 8 problems (the first 4 days worth) using nothing but C.It took me quite a while to wrap my head around solving many of those problems with the limitations that come with a low-level language. I didn’t realize how much I relied on things like dynamic length lists, Linq, and simple things like having an integer array as a parameter to a function (well, the last one is accomplished with pointers in C, but that’s a whole other fun topic). I also had to be very explicit in my memory allocation, which isn’t usually something I need to think about when writing C# or Javascript code.While I haven’t needed to write C code at BizStream since then (and most likely never will), I did at least gain the experience of needing to find new ways to solve what are typically simple problems. When I’d come back to these high-level languages after writing a handful of C, it got me thinking about ways to make my code more efficient by being a bit more aware of the space complexity of my code.
Although I’ve spent the majority of this blog post discussing why I think focusing on the tech you don’t normally use in your daily work is more beneficial to your overall growth as a developer, I want to make it abundantly clear that I think anything you do outside your typical 9–5 work is awesome, and strongly believe it will help you to grow faster than those who don’t put in the extra effort. Being a developer and staying on top of the ever-changing landscape can feel daunting at times, but hopefully, you went into this field and stuck with it because you enjoy the learning process, and continuously strive to be a better developer today than you were yesterday.

BizStream at Merge 2025: Blending Product Thinking with Software Modernization
Merge is a one-day tech conference taking place on April 28, 2025, at Daniel and Pamella DeVos Center for Interprofessional Health in Grand Rapids, MI. It’s a celebration of innovation, product development, software design, and the future of tech—all packed into one energizing day hosted by SoftwareGR.
As a proud sponsor of this year’s event, BizStream is excited to contribute to a community that shares our passion for building forward-thinking digital products. And we’re not just sponsoring—we’re speaking, too.
Time: 9:55 AM – 10:40 AM
In the world of software, products and systems don’t just remain static—they evolve, accumulate technical debt, and sometimes become an unmanageable mess of outdated frameworks, workarounds, and fragile dependencies. When dealing with a 15-year-old platform, the question isn’t just how to modernize but what to modernize.
Should you refactor piece by piece or completely rebuild? What about adding that new feature your Product Owner wants? The answer isn’t always obvious.
This session explores how blending product thinking with software modernization leads to better outcomes. Brian and Dave will walk through the lens of long-term product strategy, user needs, and business value—backed by real-world lessons from BizStream’s own SaaS platform, YouthCenter.
YouthCenter is a case study in modernizing a complex, decade-old system. You’ll learn how BizStream approached modernization not as a one-time rewrite but as a product-driven evolution, balancing technical constraints with customer expectations.
By shifting the focus from rewriting old code to delivering ongoing value, development teams can avoid the rebuild trap. Instead, they can embrace an iterative approach that promotes longevity, adaptability, and sustainability.
Whether you’re currently leading a legacy transformation or trying to avoid one in the future, this talk will showcase smart modernization decisions that don’t require hitting pause on the business.
As a Kentico, Kontent.ai, and Microsoft Azure MVP, Brian is a recognized leader in software architecture, digital marketing, and cloud solutions. With 22 years at BizStream and a hundred clients across North America, Brian shares his expertise regularly on Mcbeev.com and his podcast, Kontent Rocks.

2 Trends All Member-Based Organizations Need to Know
The digital landscape for member-based organizations is evolving quickly—and with it, the expectations of your members.
Shifting member behaviors, rising digital competition, and increasing demands for value have elevated the importance of brand differentiation and a modern, high-performing website. Revenue streams like events, education, and training are no longer guaranteed. Online engagement is fragmented. And organizations are realizing that outdated strategies and legacy technology are limiting their growth.
If you’re an association, nonprofit, or higher education institution, you may be asking:
How can we re-engage members and grow our reach?
How do we deliver clear, compelling value?
What steps do we take to modernize and stay competitive?
Leading organizations are answering these questions by embracing two powerful trends:
Telling a better story (strategic branding)
Building a better website (technology modernization)
Together, these two strategies help organizations clarify their value, connect with key audiences, and fuel sustainable growth.
If your team needs help with digital strategy or website development, connect with us. BizStream has helped organizations like yours achieve measurable success through smart branding and modern technology solutions.
Even a beautifully designed website can underperform if your messaging doesn’t resonate. At the core of every successful digital experience is a story—and that story needs to be rooted in value.
To tell a compelling story, you must first understand your audiences: their goals, frustrations, and how they make decisions. With this insight, you can shape messaging that reflects your organization’s purpose and draws members in.
Unfortunately, many organizations bury their most valuable messages or speak in ways that don’t connect. When your audience can’t quickly understand your impact, they lose interest—or never engage in the first place.
You know your mission. But do your members and prospects?Persona-driven research helps you uncover what matters most to your audience—so you can better communicate how your organization supports their needs.
Once you understand your audience’s journey, you can craft content that educates, inspires, and drives action. Use those insights to:
Position your organization as a thought leader
Build content that deepens member engagement
Develop messaging that speaks to prospects’ real challenges
Reinforce your unique value and purpose
Better content builds long-term loyalty and boosts conversions by aligning with what your audience actually wants.
Today’s website isn’t just a marketing tool—it’s your organization’s digital hub. Whether your focus is engagement, events, or education, a modern website experience is central to how you deliver value.
Here are a few key ways to improve your site’s performance while solving complex problems and reducing operational overhead:
Members expect intuitive, seamless experiences. But disconnected systems and clunky workflows often stand in the way.By taking an integrative approach—one that connects your technology stack and aligns digital touchpoints—you can streamline the experience and make it easier for users to take meaningful action.
Staying competitive requires technology that’s flexible, scalable, and fast. Member-based organizations are increasingly adopting:
Cloud-based infrastructure
API-first architectures
Modernized CMS platforms
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance personalization and insights
Modern systems allow your teams to move faster, reduce technical debt, and deliver better results.
All-in-one platforms often overpromise and underdeliver. Instead, many organizations are turning to Best-of-Breed solutions—tools that specialize in doing one thing exceptionally well.
With an API-first, modular approach, you can:
Adapt quickly to change
Lower licensing costs
Minimize risk
Launch new features faster
At BizStream, we specialize in helping organizations architect smart, modern tech stacks that balance performance and sustainability.
Need guidance on how to start? We’d love to help you modernize your tech stack, strengthen your message, and engage your members in new and powerful ways. Let’s talk.

Brian McKeiver Speaking at AAM Summit 2025
Catch Brian McKeiver, co-owner and solution architect at BizStream, as he takes the stage at the Association for Accounting Marketing (AAM) Annual Summit from May 12-14, 2025, in Phoenix, AZ, at the Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass.
AAM’s Annual Summit provides excellent educational opportunities through keynote speakers, breakout sessions, and deep-dive content blocks for every level of marketer and business developer. And if you think the education is great, wait until you experience the networking!
Networking is a huge component of Summit, and we offer both structured and informal networking opportunities throughout the conference.
Too often, we hear the words ‘personalization is a phase 2 item.’ The problem with that mindset is that overlooking website personalization can leave visitors feeling disconnected and frustrated. You miss the chance to have your content truly resonate with that visitor’s core needs, making it harder to convert them into potential clients. Personalization isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a strategic advantage that drives meaningful interactions and business growth. This session will show why taking a personalization-first approach on your firm’s website can create a more engaging, client-focused experience that delivers results.

Xperience by Kentico’s Taxonomies: What’s New & Why It Matters
If you manage digital content, organization is key. A well-structured site makes content easier to manage, improves SEO, and enhances user experience.
That’s where taxonomies come in.
Taxonomies help organize and tag content so users can find what they need faster. Whether you’re organizing blog posts or product categories, taxonomies make it easier.
With Xperience by Kentico, taxonomies received a major upgrade. They are now more flexible, scalable, and easier to manage than in Kentico 13. Let’s explore what’s changed and why marketers should be excited.
While Kentico 13 had taxonomy support, Xperience by Kentico has made the following key improvements:
Xperience’s Content Hub now fully integrates taxonomies, making it easier to:
This is a major time saver for marketers managing hundreds or thousands of pieces of content.
Kentico 13’s taxonomies were primarily focused on web content, but Xperience expands their use across multiple channels out of the box, including:
This allows content to be categorized the same way across all channels, making personalization easier and helping teams reuse content more effectively.
These updates aren’t just technical improvements, they directly benefit marketing teams by making content easier to organize, discover, and personalize.
With better taxonomy structure and multiple classifications, users can find what they need faster through site search, navigation menus, or structured content lists.Better discoverability also means improved SEO, as search engines can better understand and rank your content.
Strong taxonomies help organize content effectively, ensuring the right people get relevant content at the right time.For example:
Xperience makes it easier to personalize content across different channels by keeping taxonomies consistent across all your digital platforms.Also, combining taxonomies in Xperience By Kentico with smart folders offers marketers a dynamic way to deliver content. By tagging content items with taxonomy tags, editors can create smart folders that automatically group related content based on these tags. This setup allows widgets to display up-to-date content without manual selection. This approach is a significant improvement over Kentico 13, where such dynamic content delivery required more manual effort.
Managing large amounts of content can quickly get messy, especially when multiple teams are involved. The new taxonomy system keeps everything structured so marketers can:
Instead of spending hours searching for content, teams can focus more on content strategy.
The taxonomy improvements in Xperience by Kentico are more than just an upgrade. They’re a game changer for content organization and management.These enhancements give marketing teams greater control, flexibility, and efficiency compared to Kentico 13. Whether you manage an e-commerce site, a corporate blog, or a content marketing platform, this update simplifies content management. If you’re moving to Xperience by Kentico or thinking about doing so, this is a feature worth getting excited about.

How to Connect with—and Win—Customers: Build Better Buyer Personas
When marketers build messaging, they typically start by understanding the unique value of their company, products, and services. But just as important is understanding your customers: their roles, their pains, their business priorities and goals, their part in decision making—and their distinct buying journeys.
When you are in tune with your customers and prospects, you have the means to help them get over the pain of change and adopt the new opportunities your solutions offer. The most common reason your prospects say no is that change is painful or difficult. When you have detailed personas, you can create messaging to demonstrate how your product or service benefits them, how they can leverage your solutions to improve their situations and positively impact their companies.
Personas let you get into that prospect’s shoes and ask, “If I put on NEW shoes, do my feet feel better? Can I run faster with greater efficiency? Can I perform at a higher level?”Improving sales by changing the way you talk to your customers might also require your team to overcome the pain of change. But when you take the time to develop personas for all your different potential buyers—and then apply those insights to all the tactics in your marketing strategy—you’re already a step closer to winning more sales.
Building messaging around specific buyer personas—and creating content to support them through each stage of their journey with you—is central to the success of any marketing effort. Most marketers know this basic principle, but surprisingly few organizations build and use personas and messaging consistently or revisit them as a resource once they’ve been developed.
Detailed personas for all your customers create a foundation for accomplishing several core goals:
If you aren’t sure where to begin your customer research, we recommend starting with the most direct routes.
Reaching out to customers you know are happy—and a few that perhaps are less satisfied—will help you answer questions such as:
What is their industry?
What is their role within their company?
What are their daily responsibilities?
What are their priorities?
What prevents them from meeting those responsibilities and goals?
Who do they report to?
Who must they consult to make a buying decision?
Why do they need a solution like yours and how badly do they need it?
How exactly can your solution’s unique value help them reach their goals or meet their obligations?
What benefits will they gain from using your solution?
What objections or concerns are they likely to have about your solution?
For the most current insights into what’s going on with customers, reach out to your sales team. They spend their days talking to customers and prospects, so they have a wealth of information that you can use to create persona messaging. They can also help you better understand the specific benefits and features that generate the “aha” moments on a sales call.
Your sales team can also fill in details about how customers move through the buyer journey:
Are your ideal customers aware that a problem or need exists?
Are they aware of the causes of the problem?
Do they know that a solution exists?
Are they aware of your product or service and that it provides a solution to the problem or need?
What questions do they have about your solution?
What is their view of your solution compared to options from your competitors?
Are they aware of your successes for other customers?
Do they understand how to use your product or service?
Are they interested in learning more? If so, which products or features interest them most?
Are they willing to talk with you? If not, are they willing to read, listen to, or watch more information?
You can’t please everyone. Fortunately, you don’t need to. The key to marketing success isn’t just connecting with an audience, it’s connecting with the right audience—at the right time.
Using the answers to these questions, you can create persona messaging and use it to keep customers at the center of your content strategy. Refer to your messaging regularly to verify that everything you create, from websites to white papers, communicates the benefits of your solution when applied to your customers’ real needs.
In conjunction with your persona messaging, an understanding of your ideal customer’s buying journey can help you create a successful marketing and content strategy that improves organic search ranking, converts website visitors into qualified leads, and converts leads into sales.
The most important takeaway in all of this is to keep the customer at the center of everything your marketing team creates.
Developing personas and mapping content to your customers’ buyer journeys does take time. If bandwidth is tight, partnering with an agency team can provide a dedicated force to complete your messaging tasks.
Look for an agency that can also help you determine—
Are you ready to transform the way you connect with customers? Let’s talk.

Enhance Kentico 13 Search Index with Azure AI Search Semantic Ranker
As with any technology, search has really come a long way, especially cloud services and integrating those services with your web application. In light of that, we are going to explore adding a basic Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index and how that can dramatically improve your users’ search experience. Let’s jump right in!
First, let’s break down what our tech stack looks like.
We should also cover some prerequisites to make sure you know where our starting point is, as this article will not be covering the below items:
In order to use Semantic ranker, you will need to install newer .NET Core packages to work with the correct objects.We have a class library project, ProjectName.KenticoIntegration. In this project, we are going to install the Azure.Search.Documents package. Chances are you may already have it, but it may need to be updated. Make sure to update it in all of the projects using it.
Let’s dig into some code, shall we? There is going to be some refactoring needed, but you are mostly going to be adding to your existing code.When using Azure as a search index, generally, you are going to customize the index process in some way so that you can add your own flavor of content to the index. To provide some context, in our case, we have the following:
We are hooking into several different events with our own custom methods. We will dive into those one by one, as we will need to know what they are doing when creating the methods for configuring the index with a semantic configuration.
You’ll notice later that we have similar processes, but the objects used are from different packages. In the search index customization module, we are utilizing the Microsoft.Azure.Search packages, whereas in the helper class, we’re going to be utilizing the newer Azure.Search.Documents package to aid in creating the semantic ranker. The helper is required specifically to handle the newer Semantic ranker features we will be implementing.
When Kentico has to create and update the index, these search index objects have to match, meaning they both have to have the same configuration; otherwise you will run into errors such as the following:
“Creating or updating index ‘index-name’ failed with the following error: This index has suggesters defined in it that cannot be removed. This error is caused by attempting to update an index without including all of its existing suggesters or by attempting to update an index that was created/updated with a new version of the API.”
Now, let’s get into the actual inner workings of the index creation process.
One thing we can do to make our lives a little easier and avoid repetitive code is create a DefaultSuggester class that inherits Suggester (from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models library). We can reuse this across multiple methods, which you will see later. But, for context, here is the class now:
In this method, we are setting up the fields that will have our desired attributes—in our case, that’s several filterable and facetable fields for our search page that is already implemented.
The first thing we do is validate the incoming CreateFieldEventArgs parameter, specifically the SearchIndex.IndexCodeName to verify it is indeed the correct index. We then configure our fields with their appropriate values based on our needs:
In this method, we add our fields as necessary, formatting values that require formatting as well.
And for context, here is our AddField method:
This custom method ties everything together.
The method calls two more private methods (AddSuggester and AddSemanticConfiguration), one to set up the suggesters and the other to set up the semantic configuration.
For reference, one of the important things you have to do is make sure to reference the .NET Framework package here. Note the “AzureSearchModels” alias, which we have aliased from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models package. More on that momentarily. Let’s take a look at the AddSemanticConfiguration:
Notice we are using the fluent interface design pattern for chaining purposes. As noted above, we are doing all of this with the older package so that things are compatible with Kentico’s process, but we need to extend this with our new class to utilize the new packages and semantic options. We will explore that in a moment in the next section, but first let’s review some of what’s going on with the configuration method above.In our configuration, the semantic title field is associated with the Title field of the node. The content fields for the semantic configuration were just the fields on the node that had a majority of the content that would be matched with a semantic search. We also didn’t have any fields in our case that made sense for the Keywords fields.Another thing to keep in mind with semantic search is how it tokenizes the input and the limit on those tokens. Approximately 20,000 characters will max out the search, meaning if you have fields that are extremely long in your configuration, it could possibly eat up all of the available tokens. This is an important detail, so organizing the fields is crucial to ensure the most relevant fields are included in the search.
In our SearchIndexHelper class, located in our KenticoIntegration project, we instantiate a couple of private properties and our constructor. Note that the SearchIndex and the SearchIndexClient (and other objects) are both from the Azure.Search.Documents package. We also alias the older package so we can pass in the legacy field to the WithField method.
We use our search admin key and service name that were retrieved from the key vault and passed in to create our client. After the constructor, there are our chaining methods.
This is the method that we will call from the customization module code to integrate the two classes, integrating the Kentico CMS with the newer .NET Core packages necessary to work with Semantic ranker.
And that is the overall concept of implementing Semantic ranker with your Kentico 13 search index within Azure. With this type of configuration, search results on your website will have a layer of semantic association. The biggest challenge I ran into was integrating the .NET Framework packages of Kentico with the new .NET Core packages. The indexes have to match definitions across both packages, including the suggesters. Adding Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index is a powerful enhancement, even with minimal configuration. If you are using a free search service, you will have to weigh the costs of creating a new Basic plan search service. However, if you are already paying for the Basic plan, it might be a no-brainer to enhance the user experience within your Kentico sites search.Happy coding!

Simple Guide for Creating an Azure AI Search Index in Xperience by Kentico
Xperience by Kentico is the latest modern content management system that Kentico has released. It immediately stands out with its sleek, modern interface, fast navigation, and powerful features. One key feature is the ability to integrate with Azure AI Search. This post outlines the steps to configure a project for Azure AI Search integration and set up the Azure AI Search module in the admin to build a search index using content types defined in Xperience.
Below is what will be used to implement this feature:
The initial steps focus on configuring the project to make Azure AI Search accessible within the Xperience admin interface. This involves installing the Azure Search package for Xperience by Kentico, setting it up in the Program.cs file, and ensuring it’s recognized in the Xperience admin.
There are a few ways to install the package:
Success! The Azure AI Search package for Xperience by Kentico is now installed on the project.
Next, open the Program.cs file and call the IServiceCollection extension method AddKenticoAzureSearch, passing it the ConfigurationManager. The line of code should look like this:
The project can now be run. Upon accessing the Xperience admin interface, a new module under Development titled “Azure AI Search” should now be visible.
With the program configured to access the Azure AI Search module, the next step is connecting the Azure AI Search service to the application.
These steps involve:
By the end of this process, the Azure AI Search service will be fully connected and ready to handle search queries within the application.
If a 500 error occurs when accessing the ‘Azure AI Search’ module, it is likely due to missing settings from the search service. To resolve this, right-click the project in Visual Studio and select ‘Manage User Secrets.’ Then, paste the following keys:
IMPORTANT: The names of the keys must match exactly what they are named above.
To retrieve the values for these keys, consult the following settings in the Azure AI Search service:
Note: If a query key does not already exist, be sure to create one by clicking the “Add” button, entering a name, and clicking “Done.” This should automatically generate a key to be copied.
After rebuilding the project, returning to the admin, and accessing the module, the error should no longer appear.
The next step involves developing a strategy for building the search index, ensuring that the fields of the content types are properly mapped. For this example, the NewsDetail and Homepage content types from my “Azure Search Test” Xperience channel will be used.Begin by adding two files to your project: one for the search model and one for the search strategy. In this example, those files will be named XperienceAzureExampleModel and XperienceAzureExampleStrategy, respectively.The model will inherit from the BaseAzureSearchModel that the Xperience Azure Search package provides.
The strategy will inherit from BaseAzureSearchIndexingStrategy<TSearchModel> provided by the Xperience Azure Search package, with the model created earlier used as the TSearchModel. Next, implement the MapToAzureSearchModelOrNull method. This method checks whether the incoming IIndexEventItemModel parameter matches one of the content types intended for inclusion in the search index. If a match is found, the relevant fields from the content type will be mapped to the corresponding fields in the TSearchModel, and the model will be returned.
After implementing the strategy, return to the Program.cs file and update the previous line of code that was implemented earlier to look like this:
With the search strategy now successfully implemented, the next step is to configure the search index in the Xperience admin, preparing it for the indexing process. This will ensure everything is ready for building the index and integrating your search functionality seamlessly.
To begin this final step, navigate back to the Azure AI Search module in the Xperience admin. Click the “Create Index” button, then follow these steps: enter the Included Path, select the Included content types (matching those from the search strategy), specify the Index Name, choose the Indexed Languages, select the Channel Name, and finally, choose the indexing strategy implemented earlier from the Indexing Strategy dropdown. Be sure to save the path and then save the index.
In the Azure AI Search module, the index can now be rebuilt by clicking the “Rebuild” icon.
Returning to the Azure AI Search service, navigate to Search Management> Indexes. The index should now appear, matching the name specified in Xperience.
The contents of the index should now display only the content types included in the search strategy that have corresponding pages within the Xperience channel.
By following these steps, a fully functional integration between Xperience by Kentico and Azure AI Search has been established. The project configuration, search strategy implementation, and search index setup in the Xperience admin now allow content types to be indexed and searched efficiently. This integration not only enhances the search capabilities of the application but also demonstrates the flexibility and power of Xperience when paired with Azure AI Search. With everything in place, the application is ready to handle and optimize search queries, providing users with fast and relevant search results.

Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status
You’ve probably heard the term “10x software engineer” thrown around—this mythical creature who is supposedly ten times more productive than their peers, able to churn out code faster, solve problems quicker, and deliver results with superhuman efficiency. Companies drool over the idea of finding a “10x engineer,” the one developer who can carry an entire team on their back. But here’s the reality: the idealization of a 10x engineer as the end goal is a myth.
Being a great engineer isn’t about raw output or cranking out ten times the amount of code. It’s about solving problems in the most effective way possible, making smart decisions, and guiding others with well-informed recommendations. The engineers who make the biggest impact aren’t the ones who write the most code—they’re the ones who can navigate complexity, communicate clearly, and steer projects in the right direction. If you can talk the talk and walk the walk, you’re the real 10x software engineer. You’re worth your weight in gold.
Engineering is, at its core, problem-solving. It’s not just about knowing the latest JavaScript framework or the newest cloud service. It’s about understanding the problem, evaluating the available tools, and applying them effectively. With the sheer number of tools and technologies available today, the ability to sift through the noise and choose the right one is what separates the good engineers from the great ones.
Forget the “10x software engineer” nonsense. The real 10x skill is versatility—being able to move between different technologies and domains with ease. It’s about having a deep understanding of core principles and applying them across various scenarios. And here’s the kicker: you don’t need to know every tool. You just need to know enough to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.
Let’s get specific:
React is the go-to for most developers, but Svelte might be the better choice for projects where performance and simplicity are key. My recommendation? Stick with React if you’re building something that requires a robust ecosystem and community support. But don’t sleep on Svelte if you need something lightweight and performant.
Node.js is great for asynchronous, real-time applications, while .NET Core shines in enterprise environments with heavy computational tasks. If you’re working on a web API that needs to scale quickly, Node.js is a solid choice. But if you’re dealing with enterprise-level data processing, .NET Core might be the better fit. My recommendation? Use Node.js for quick, scalable web services and .NET Core when you need to integrate deeply with Microsoft ecosystems. And PLEASE use TypeScript.
Both AWS and Azure offer a wide range of services, but they excel in different areas. AWS is known for its breadth and maturity, making it a great choice for startups and companies looking for a wide range of tools. Azure, on the other hand, integrates seamlessly with Microsoft products, making it ideal for enterprises. My recommendation? Choose AWS if you’re building something from scratch and need a variety of tools. Opt for Azure if you’re in a Microsoft-centric environment.
OAuth2 is powerful for complex, multi-user environments, while JWT is great for simple, stateless authentication. If you’re building a multi-tenant SaaS platform, OAuth2 is the way to go. For simpler applications with a need for secure, stateless authentication, JWT gets the job done. My recommendation? Use OAuth2 for complex, enterprise-grade applications and JWT for leaner, straightforward authentication needs.
Figma is excellent for collaborative, web-based design work, while Adobe XD offers powerful offline capabilities and tight integration with other Adobe tools. My recommendation? Go with Figma for real-time collaboration and XD if you’re already embedded in the Adobe ecosystem.
Let’s be clear: The idea of a 10x software engineer is a myth. It’s not about output—it’s about making smart decisions. The best engineers aren’t just cranking out code; they’re making strategic choices that drive the project forward. And the most critical of these choices? Making solid recommendations.
Here’s one truth: Making a recommendation is one of the most valuable things you can do as an engineer. When you suggest a solution, you’re not just offering an opinion—you’re providing a roadmap. If you can make strong, well-informed recommendations and back them up with confidence, you become indispensable. You’re not just an engineer; you’re a strategist.
Here’s a harder truth: The people who call the shots often don’t know what they’re talking about. They’re not the ones deep in the code, dealing with the complexities of the tech stack or understanding the nuances of what needs to be done. It’s important to communicate clearly when what they’re asking for might require more time or resources to do right. A good boss will appreciate your expertise and trust your judgment. If they don’t, it might be worth considering whether you’re in the right environment.
You’re tasked with building a high-performance web application. The client wants something snappy and efficient. Do you default to Node.js/React because it’s popular and Joe Blow at work said we should use it all the time? Do you recommend Svelte because you believe it’s more performant in this use case? Here’s my take: If performance is the #1 priority, we need to think beyond JavaScript metaframe-works and focus on the architecture. First and foremost, we need server-side rendering, and there’s hardly a more performant stack than C# ASP.NET Core with all of its caching capabilities and optimized memory management. If you’re using C# and opting into cloud hosting, you’re looking at Elastic Beanstalk or AWS App Services. Client-side, we want something that is lightweight to reduce bloat. If you can, go with vanilla JavaScript (with TypeScript for development, of course). At each step, the priority is reduction, caching, and minimizing client-server interactions.
You’re dealing with a backend that’s starting to creak under heavy data loads. Do you recommend scaling out with more servers, or do you take the time to refactor and optimize the existing code? My recommendation: This depends on the budget. Scaling out is definitely a quicker fix, especially if you’re hosting in Azure or AWS, but it could burn a hole in your pocket if you’re not careful. Optimizing data caching is the fix, as opposed to a band aid solution like scaling out.
You’re building an authentication system for a consumer-facing app. Do you go all-in on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for maximum security, or do you recommend a simpler, frictionless OAuth2 flow that won’t scare away users? My recommendation: Consider your user base. For a consumer app, prioritize a smooth user experience by implementing a simple OAuth2 flow, with MFA as an optional feature for those who want extra security. This approach minimizes friction, making it easy for users to sign in while still offering additional protection when needed. In contrast, for enterprise apps handling sensitive data, mandatory MFA is essential despite adding complexity, as the higher stakes require robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
Here’s the thing, if you can make strong, well-informed recommendations, you’re worth your weight in gold. The best engineers don’t just code—they guide. They look at the bigger picture, make strategic choices, and confidently steer projects in the right direction. That’s the real 10x skill: not writing ten times more code, but making ten times more impactful decisions.
When you’re making those decisions, you need to be ready to answer some key questions that will determine the success of any project. Here are a few you should have answers to if you want to be a formidable opponent in the tech space:
Are you going with the tried and true, or is this a time to experiment with something new? What are the project’s priorities: speed, budget maintenance, reliability, security, or something in between?
AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem, or somewhere else entirely? What’s the cost, and what’s the support like?
Break down the problem into smaller parts. Identify the risks involved for the task at hand. For example:
Being able to answer these questions confidently—and making sure the people who call the shots understand the implications—sets you apart as an engineer who’s not just competent but invaluable.
The true power of a software engineer lies not in the quantity of their output but in the quality of their decisions. Specialize in solving complex problems, have a passion for what you do, and learn from your losses—those “L’s” are what make you better. Be versatile, be confident, use failure as a learning opportunity, and most importantly, be someone who makes strong, informed recommendations. That’s how you become invaluable in an industry where change is the only constant. You’re not just an engineer—you’re a problem solver, a guide, and a rockstar.

From .bak to .bacpac: Managing Azure Migrations with Non-Standard Backups
When it comes to cloud migrations, not every scenario plays by the book. Our recent migration of a Kentico project to Azure was supposed to be straightforward—until we were handed a .bak file instead of the expected .bacpac. This blog post unpacks the unique challenges we faced and provides a detailed walkthrough of our solution.
Note: You might wonder why we didn’t simply restore the database directly on our Azure server using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). It’s important to understand that Azure SQL Server does not support restoring from a .bak file directly. Instead, Azure requires the use of .bacpac files for database imports. This distinction is crucial for planning migrations and requires alternative strategies when traditional backups are not feasible.
Before diving into the complexities of migration, it’s crucial to understand the environment we’re dealing with. One of the first hurdles we encountered involved identifying the SQL Server version of the .bak file provided, as mismatched versions between the source and target can complicate restorations.Typically, this information isn’t accessible without restoring the database, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, there’s a more efficient approach: using a SQL query to extract this information directly from the .bak file. By running the following SQL command, we can peek into the .bak file to retrieve essential details about the SQL Server environment without the need for a full restore:
Replace ‘C:\PathToYourBackup\YourBackupFile.bak’ with the actual path to your .bak file. This query provides a snapshot of the database’s metadata, including the version, which is instrumental in planning a smooth migration.
Once you have determined the SQL Server version of your .bak file, you may encounter scenarios where it is incompatible with all your available SQL Server versions. If this happens, consider the following options:
If your .bak file is compatible with your target SQL Server version, the next step is to restore the database. This process can seem daunting, but with the right commands and a careful approach, it can be executed smoothly. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you restore your database from a .bak file:
This process will transfer the data from the .bak file back into a live SQL Server environment, effectively recreating the original database structure and contents on your target server.
Due to the substantial size of certain tables within our database, a direct export to a .bacpac file was not feasible, as it would routinely cause timeouts. To circumvent this issue, we opted to individually extract these large tables using the Bulk Copy Program (bcp). This method allows us to offload the data efficiently and handle it separately, which is crucial for managing the database size during migration.
Important: Before proceeding with the BCP process, ensure that any foreign key constraints related to these large tables have been properly handled. Refer to the “Handling Foreign Key Constraints During Large Table Exports” section further in this article for detailed instructions on how to drop and reapply these constraints to avoid complications during the migration process.
For example, to export a large table, you can use the following bcp command in an administrative command shell:
Note: if Windows authentication isn’t an option for connecting to SQL Server, use:
Replace dbo.YourTableName with the name of your large table, <YourFilePath>\<FileName>.dat with the path where you want to store the exported data, YourDatabaseName with the name of your database, and YourSQLServerInstance with your SQL Server instance name. By executing this command, the specified table’s data is exported into a .dat file, effectively reducing the load and complexity involved in the main database export process. This technique not only simplifies the handling of large datasets but also ensures that all parts of the database are backed up with integrity and are ready for a smooth transition.
When dealing with large tables that have foreign key constraints, there’s an additional step to consider. Since foreign keys enforce relationships between tables, they can complicate the export process, especially when using bcp or excluding these tables from the .bacpac file. Here’s how to manage this:
In our case, we were fortunate that our large tables didn’t have any foreign key constraints, simplifying the process. However, this may not be the case for others, so it’s important to prepare for this scenario.
After handling the large tables with the bcp command, the next step in our migration process involves exporting the remainder of the database into a .bacpac file. This file format is ideal for Azure migrations but requires a careful approach when dealing with oversized data. Here’s how to efficiently exclude the large tables during the export:
By strategically excluding large tables during the .bacpac export, we ensure the file remains manageable and tailored for Azure migration. This approach minimizes potential timeouts and errors associated with large database sizes, streamlining the migration process to Azure.
Once the .bacpac file has been successfully exported without the oversized tables, the next phase involves setting up your Azure SQL Database and integrating the large tables you managed separately. This two-step process ensures that all components of your original database are accurately recreated in the Azure environment. Here’s how to complete this integration effectively:
To deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:
To deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:
By carefully setting up the Azure SQL Database and methodically integrating the large tables, you can ensure a complete and functional migration that mirrors your original database environment. This meticulous approach not only secures data integrity but also enhances the overall performance and scalability of your database in the cloud.
In conclusion, migrating a project to Azure involves more than just transferring data; it requires strategic planning and careful execution, especially when dealing with large databases. By employing methods such as using bcp for large tables and efficiently managing .bacpac imports, we can overcome the limitations posed by traditional migration methods. The steps outlined in this guide not only simplify the process but also ensure that every component of the database is accurately recreated in the Azure environment, maintaining integrity and performance. As cloud technologies continue to evolve, so too do our approaches to optimizing these migrations, enabling businesses to leverage the full potential of cloud computing.

Using Page Builder With Custom Routing in Xperience by Kentico
Recently, I was working on a project that I needed to implement status code pages that had page builder enabled on them. Since these were status code pages, I needed custom routing and could not use Content Tree routing provided by Xperience by Kentico. Once I enabled page builder for this content type and added editable areas to the view, I quickly realized I was missing something.
When I ran the project and hit my newly created status code pages, I received the following error:
When using custom routing, Xperience does not have context into which content tree page is connected to the custom route URL. Therefore, it cannot provide the page builder widgets associated with the page you are trying to reach.
To provide a little insight into the data behind the scenes: each web page item has a widget field where the page builder configuration is stored in. This can be found in the CMS_ContentItemCommonData database table, in the ContentItemCommonDataPageBuilderWidgets and ContentItemCommonDataPageTemplateConfiguration columns.
If Xperience doesn’t know which web page is associated with the request, then it cannot render the corresponding widgets.
With the information from above in mind, we can infer that we need two things. We need to retrieve the web page item associated with the request, and the page context, or in other words, the data associated with that page (page builder widgets).
We will use the ContentItemQueryBuilder and GetWebPageResult to retrieve the web page item. In order to grab the correct web page item, we need to limit the results by the WebPageItemId. We can do this by getting the page context using the IWebPageDataContextRetriever. The code below shows how we can build the query to retrieve the page.
We are limiting the result to only the web page item whose WebPageItemID matches the page context WebPageItemID.
The final step in retrieving the web page item is the execution of the query using GetWebPageResult. If you want to read more about Xperience’s Content item API and retrieving pages, you can reference their documentation here.
Finally, we need to pass the context of the web page item to Xperience. This can be accomplished by using the IWebPageDataContextInitializer interface, which provides an Initialize method that takes a RoutedWebPage item as an argument. We can construct the RoutedWebPage object from the page data that we retrieved.
To wrap it up, integrating page builder with custom routing in Xperience may require some extra steps, but the process is straightforward once you understand the underlying mechanics. By manually retrieving the page data and initializing the context, you can get your custom-routed pages working seamlessly with the page builder. This approach not only resolves the context issue but also keeps your custom-routed pages flexible and fully integrated with Xperience’s powerful content management features.

Xperience by Kentico Content Querying Updates
With the release of Xperience by Kentico, the platform has experienced significant transformations aimed at enhancing flexibility and performance. This version introduces a range of new features and improvements, marking a clear shift from previous iterations. An aspect of these changes is the updates to the API, which now adopts a modular and service-oriented architecture. These updates are designed to provide developers with more efficient and powerful tools for managing content and integrating with third-party systems. The new API structure emphasizes flexibility, allowing for more precise queries and streamlined data operations, which improves developer experience and application performance.
The first notable change to Xperience by Kentico’s API from previous iterations is the removal of the concept of a TreeNode. Previously, TreeNode was central to representing and managing the hierarchical structure of pages within the CMS, allowing developers to manipulate page data directly through a tree-like structure. The removal of this concept marks a significant shift in how content hierarchies are handled within the platform. The tree structure, while powerful, imposed certain limitations on scalability and performance, particularly as websites grew in complexity and size. By moving away from a tree-based model, Kentico aims to provide a more flexible and modular approach to content management that can better support modern web development needs.
In place of TreeNode, Xperience by Kentico now utilizes new APIs that separate content retrieval into two sets of objects: one for querying web page-specific content from a given channel called IWebPageFieldsSource and one for querying re-usable content from the new Content Hub called IContentItemFieldsSource. These interfaces make it easier and more efficient to retrieve and manage content.
The ContentItemQueryBuilder class is at the core of this new querying system. It allows developers to build detailed queries tailored to specific content types and retrieval needs. Paired with the IContentQueryExecutor, the API supports complex filtering, sorting, and data manipulation, making it easier to develop dynamic, content-rich applications. This new API structure enhances the developer experience by improving the ability to handle complex content scenarios with ease.Shown below is a depiction of the overall structure of a content item query.
Below are some examples of the new content item querying in action. We will walk through how to build and execute your queries efficiently, and some different query options you have at your disposal.
To start, you can build a simple query that retrieves all items of a specific content type. This is useful when you need to fetch a complete list of content items for display or processing.
Then, you can apply subquery configuration and global parameters like sorting to the content items being queried.
If you need to filter content items based on tags within a specific taxonomy, this approach allows you to target content items that are associated with certain tags, making it easier to manage and display tagged content.
After your query is built, it is time to execute the query. This is where IContentItemQueryExecutor comes in. Assuming that the IContentItemQueryExecutor is injected like so:
When querying content items, you can execute the query and map the results to a model to handle the retrieved data efficiently. Here are two approaches using the IContentItemQueryExecutor.
This method maps the query results directly to a specified model:
Alternatively, you can pass in a custom model binder to handle the mapping. This provides flexibility if you need custom mapping logic or additional processing during the binding.
When you need to retrieve both web page-related data and content item-related data, the Xperience by Kentico API provides methods to execute these queries and map the results to your models. This is useful for scenarios where you want to handle data that includes both the content of a web page and additional metadata or settings associated with it.
The GetMappedWebPageResult<TModel> method is used to execute a query and map the results to a specified model type. It is similar to the GetMappedResult<TModel> function but also allows access to web page-related database columns.
Alternatively, the GetWebPageResult method allows you to pass in a custom model binder. This provides flexibility for custom mapping logic, enabling you to process and transform the retrieved data as needed.
By using these methods, you can efficiently execute queries and handle the results, whether you’re working with content item data, web page data, or both. The choice between using GetMappedResult/GetMappedWebPageResult and their counterparts with a model binder depends on your need for standard or custom mapping logic.
The updates to Xperience by Kentico represent a significant evolution in how developers can query and structure content within the platform. The shift from the traditional TreeNode structure to a more modular and flexible architecture, combined with the new querying capabilities, makes Xperience by Kentico a capable solution for modern web development needs.

The BizStream Internship Program
Are you interested in applying for an internship at BizStream, or are you looking for inspiration to develop your own successful program?
Regardless of your needs, I think you’ll find some valuable insights here to help you either take part in or run your own internship program. Today, I’m excited to share the ins and outs of the internship process here at BizStream.
My goal is to give you a peek into the inner workings of our tried and true process for hiring and working alongside interns. If you’re considering applying for one of our internship positions, I hope to provide all the preparation you need to make that decision with confidence. We’ve learned a lot over the years, and I hope our experiences can help you avoid some of the pitfalls we’ve encountered.
It’s very important that we discuss what an intern is and is not at BizStream.
An intern is not:
An intern is:
There are a lot of internships out there. We get it. It can be overwhelming to sift through thousands of opportunities only to find a job listing at a “respectable company” where you’ll be stuck doing grunt work for the next 90 days. You end up walking out, having learned nothing except how to efficiently place orders at Starbucks. Been there. No thanks.
At BizStream, we believe it’s our responsibility to lead and foster growth in the next generation—the future builders of cool things that make a worldly impact. That’s why landing an internship here is so challenging. We have incredibly high standards and expectations. But don’t let that discourage you. You’ve read this far, so why not keep going?
The first thing we ask is for anyone interested in applying for our internship program to go to bizstream.com/careers/internships. From that page, scroll to the bottom and see if there is an open position for an internship within your line of profession. As of writing this, we have one developer internship slot currently open. If you select “Learn More” you will be taken to a detail page describing the internship position. If you want to apply, simply select “Apply to Position”.
We also have an “Internship Availability” graphic on that page which can help those seeking a specific date/time for their internship to know if we have any availability.
Once the internship form has been submitted and the candidate has uploaded the typical requests (resume, portfolio link, LinkedIn) via our form, our team gathers the applications and does a first-round vetting.
This first round of vetting is to check for things like:
If a potential candidate passes the initial vetting phase, we move on to the phone interview, typically a 30-minute conversation. The goal is to get the individual relaxed and talking about their passions. We want to know what they hope to gain from this internship and assess whether BizStream is the right place for them to achieve those goals.
Note: It is crucial that expectations are set and as clear and concise as possible. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the duration, timeline, compensation, and any other school-related requirements (if any).
If the candidate makes it past the phone interview, that’s when the real fun begins. Specific to our development interns, our team has crafted a unique and engaging set of tests using coderpad.io to give us a baseline of the applicant’s skill set. This forms the foundation for how we craft their experience at BizStream. Not to worry, though! The whole test takes roughly 2–4 hours, depending on experience level.
I mentioned above that our internships are a notch above the rest. We don’t hire on grunts. We hire passionate individuals who want to gain a high level of experience from industry professionals. I know it sounds cliche, but you would not believe how many places get this wrong.
Before I get into the details, it’s important to understand that no two internships are identical. We offer marketing, design, and development internship positions, and each intern comes with a certain level of experience, which dictates how far down the path they will travel.
On day one, our interns get a crash course in the “Life at BizStream”  and a team lunch to get to know their team members. We then assign each intern a mentor for the duration of their internship. Our goal is to ensure our interns are never forgotten and feel fully integrated into our teams. They attend all of our team standups, are reviewed by their peers as an operating member of the team, and are required to show up within our designated work times.
We curate an internship experience to be unique to the individual. For example, our most recent intern was a developer on Team Tangerine. Her first 30 days included a lot of reading from some of our favorite books (Add links to starting books), as well as solutioning, architecting, and building out her own personal project.
If the individual crushes their personal project, their mentor may decide to transition them into working on a BizStream internal project. These projects are designed to bring significant ROI to the greater BizStream team. For a developer internship, it could be an application that automates building out SOWs, a better tracking system for our daily goals, or even a potential product we plan to ship. For marketing, maybe it’s a re-design of one of our existing websites or updating content in our space to bring it up to brand. Regardless, it’s a tremendous opportunity.
Certain interns may even get a chance to move into billable client work. This is where the rubber meets the road in terms of skill set and actual application; dealing with real-world requirements and deadlines.
At the end of the 90 days, we review the intern’s time with us via 360 feedback. Our team spends at least an hour doing a deep dive into their work output and overall experience. And let’s not forget, we send them off with a fun social hour/mixer.
We have spent years crafting our internship process into what we believe is a valuable opportunity for anyone who is trying to break into our industry. It’s challenging and at times can be a bit of a push out of their comfort zone. However, our unique approach to how we so intricately weave these candidates into our BizStream family is what makes BizStream such a unique place to work.
We offer internships in many fields, including web development, creative design, and marketing. To learn more about our internship program, check out our internship page to see what opportunities are available.

I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
I joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn’t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.
That same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.
I went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).
I was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
We have a group of like-minded people here. There’s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I’m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it. When people think it can’t be done, we’ve done it.
I love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It’s what I’d do even if BizStream didn’t exist. What we do at BizStream isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s challenging, sure, but I couldn’t be in a job that wasn’t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.
It also makes me happy that we’ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the BizStream Academy — a program where we offer development training for students — and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.
I work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work, which is one of the great things about BizStream — the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I’m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.
When I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),  and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy. I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico’s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world. When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.
As a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don’t care that it’s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but I was learning what “whatever it takes” really means.
I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I’ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I’m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I’ve never met a Roulette table I didn’t like.

Kentico Xperience Site of the Year Global Winner
BizStream provided BDO USA, LLP with an enhanced user experience, responsive design, online marketing functionality, integration with existing infrastructure and third-party services, such as CRM and LMS, and enhanced SEO for better rankings and improved security requirements. BizStream also assisted BDO USA, LLP with migrating from their previous CMS to Kentico Xperience.
Working with BizStream has been a pleasure. Not only do they know the Kentico platform inside and out, but they also genuinely care about delivering the best solution possible. BizStream fully supported us through the early stages of the project, where we appreciated the detailed discovery sessions that BizStream led us through to get the requirements right. As the process continued and as our site was built, we liked their approach to sprint-based delivery and their ability to adapt to some of the last-minute details. That support was felt most as the final go-live of the site was met. Our stakeholders were extremely happy with the results. At each point, we felt we could count on BizStream, unlike other vendors we have encountered in the past.

BizStream Has a New Look
We’ve come a long way since our founding. Our previous brand no longer fits our capabilities or our future ambitions. To better align our brand experience with the direction our agency is headed, a full rebrand was necessary.
Since our inception, we’ve always been a hardworking, knowledgeable technical development agency. We’re now more than that. We’ve brought design services in-house, our development team is continuously growing in number and expertise, and our product offering is more robust than it’s ever been. The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
Generally speaking, we wanted a brand that exuded more fun and excitement while also being professional. So, after reviewing our previous brand materials and a brand assessment by our leadership team, we dialed in on five key attributes we wanted our brand to be: Dynamic, Smart, Friendly, Vibrant, and Clean.
For inspiration, we looked at branding from all over, across all types of media. Making sure to look at other creative digital agencies; how they expressed their brand on their website, on social media, and in their marketing materials. We used all of this inspiration as a reference as we crafted our new brand’s look and feel.
Our previous logo’s heart was in the right place, but the execution wasn’t right for us anymore. For example, we liked the idea of the “B” and “S” combo in the icon, but the previous icon was visually busy, and the thin negative spaces didn’t reproduce well at small sizes.
As we reworked the icon, we came upon a happy accident of a yin-yang shape in the middle, which was a fitting visual expression of our new design + development service offering.
The font used in the previous wordmark was too thin when paired with the icon, and the serifs didn’t fit stylistically very well. The weight of the new wordmark balances much better with the new icon, is much cleaner, and is more aesthetically aligned with our brand attributes.
Our previous color palette used shades of the primary colors (red, yellow, and blue), which did not give our brand much uniqueness or individual style. In addition, during our review of the previous brand, we determined that almost all of the colors from the palette were used on every individual marketing item. This hurt the information hierarchy and made many of the items more visually complex than necessary.
The new color palette has more focus on creating a unique look and feel with color. Plus, it has a greater range of values to make more dynamic compositions. As well as vibrant secondary colors that can help add visual flair when needed.
The fonts used with our previous brand felt too industrial and clunky, especially when used in large headlines. The lines and curves of our new fonts have a more casual and friendly feel. Our new fonts also have a wider range of weights which allow for more design flexibility when creating branded items.
The last essential item needed for the rebrand was the development of graphic elements. Graphic elements are visual items or treatments that tie the brand together across various media. Similar to the logo, but much more varied, they create a visual connection from one brand experience to the next. Common graphic elements include: icons, illustrations, patterns, specific image cropping, etc.
Redesigning every aspect of our brand helps visually establish the next chapter of our agency. We could have updated just some aspects of the brand and marketing materials, but it wouldn’t have felt right for what we wanted to do. We want current and future clients to get a better feel for who we are and what we do simply by being exposed to our brand. A full rebrand was the only way to achieve that goal. We’re the same great digital partner we’ve always been, now with an updated look and a wider service offering.
Not only did we design and implement our own rebrand. We also do this for our clients! If you’d like us to help with your rebrand project, contact us.

Unifying Four Business Units into One Seamless Digital Experience for a Leading Benefits Provider
Trustmark is a national employee benefits company with specialized expertise in voluntary benefits, self-funded health benefits, and health and fitness management. For more than 100 years, Trustmark has helped people and businesses thrive.
Kentico Xperience Site of the Month
Trustmark needed to consolidate its existing business unit websites into one central, dynamic site. Previously, the business unit-specific sites (Voluntary Benefits, Health Benefits, Small Business Benefits, and HealthFitness) catered to different markets and business sizes. This approach needed to be updated to match a new brand initiative. Trustmark’s goal was to ensure that the next iteration of the One Brand site provided consistent branding across all of its business units.
While Trustmark had partnered with Bizstream on several Kentico projects in the past, this was by far the largest and most complex one to date. BizStream was able to translate the function and design requirements into manageable agile development sprints. The Trustmark Marketing and Web Development teams worked closely with the Bizstream team to refine the requirements and update components when needed. The modular nature of Kentico Page Builder allowed us to roll out features in sprints that enabled our internal stakeholders to develop content quickly and see immediate results. Instead of being overwhelmed, our internal stakeholders were able to meet the milestones more easily. BizStream Kentico specialization made it possible to Trustmark to launch our new One Brand consolidated website on time.

Mark Schmidt
Our motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.
The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that’s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU’s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I’d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.
After GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.
With a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That’s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don’t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That’s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.
At BizStream, we’ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it’s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be cliché, but it’s true — we work hard and we play hard.
I’ve found that if you’re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people’s shoes, and I’m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don’t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don’t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren’t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.
The reason BizStream’s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn’t want to work at a typical job. That doesn’t mean I didn’t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let’s make it something we want to do.
This mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We’ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).
In addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College’s computer sciences department. It’s really cool because I’m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.
When I’m not working, I’m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I’m not at work, I’m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I’ve done a lot of home automation, and I’m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.
Work is such a big part of most everyone’s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.
There’s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” That’s where it’s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren’t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.

5 Questions You Should Ask Yourself About Your Company’s Brand Experience
A strong brand identity is critical for any business that wants to stand out in today’s competitive market. Your brand is not just your logo or your website; it’s the entire experience that your customers have with your company. To ensure that your brand experience is consistent, relevant, and engaging, there are five key questions that you should ask yourself.
A brand guide and a style guide can be invaluable tools in building a comprehensive and consistent brand identity for your company.
A brand guide outlines the fundamental elements of your brand, such as its vision, values, and messaging. It provides guidance on how your brand should be presented across all channels, ensuring that your branding is consistent and aligned with your company’s mission and goals. A well-crafted brand guide can help you maintain brand consistency, build brand recognition, and establish a unique identity in the market.
A style guide, on the other hand, focuses on the visual aspects of your brand, including the use of colors, typography, imagery, and other design elements. It provides clear guidelines on how to use these elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing brand image. A style guide can help your team understand how to use your brand’s visual elements consistently, reducing the risk of confusion or misrepresentation.
Although brand guides and style guides can exist on their own, they’re even more effective when combined together. Incorporating style guide sections within the overall brand guide creates a more robust, single source of assets and guidelines. Having well-documented brand and style guidelines creates a strong and consistent brand identity that resonates with your audience and helps you stand out from your competitors. By providing clear guidance on how to represent your brand, these combined guides save time and resources by streamlining the branding process and ensuring that all team members are aligned.
Discover how BizStream collaborated closely with the Woodpreneur team to establish a cohesive brand identity across various channels such as their brand, website, podcast, merchandise, and beyond.
It’s not necessary to update your brand colors every year to keep up with the latest design trends, but incorporating a modern color palette can certainly have its advantages. Using contemporary color schemes can help your brand appear fresh, relevant, and appealing to a younger audience.In addition to colors, having a modern logo design can also make a significant impact on your brand image. A well-designed logo with a contemporary look can signal to your audience that your brand is up-to-date and keeping pace with the latest design trends. This can help you to stand out from your competitors and attract new customers.However, it’s important to strike a balance between modernity and timelessness. A brand’s visual identity should be distinctive and recognizable, not simply a reflection of current trends. Therefore, it’s crucial to work with a skilled designer who can create a visually compelling and timeless logo that also incorporates modern design elements.Incorporating modern design elements into your brand can enhance its appeal and help you connect with your audience. By striking a balance between modernity and timelessness, you can create a visual identity that represents your brand’s values and resonates with your customers for years to come.
See how we brought new life to our outdated brand through a comprehensive rebrand that reflects our qualities of being Dynamic, Smart, Friendly, Vibrant, and Clean.
Consistency is key when it comes to branding across all your digital and non-digital platforms. It’s essential to ensure that your brand’s colors, messaging, logo, and other visual elements are consistent across all channels. This will help your audience recognize and remember your brand easily, and it will also reinforce your company’s vision and values.
Creating a consistent brand experience is crucial for building strong customer relationships. Imagine having a great customer experience with a company during the initial stages of a sale, only to discover that the final invoice letterhead displays a logo from 10 years ago or the website’s color scheme is completely different from the rest of the company’s branding. Such inconsistencies can create confusion and erode trust in the brand, potentially leading to lost customers.
To avoid such situations, it’s important to pay attention to every detail of your brand’s representation across all platforms, both digital and non-digital. Whether it’s your website, social media profiles, or printed materials, ensure that your branding is consistent and reflects your company’s vision and values. This will help to build a strong brand identity that resonates with your audience and creates a lasting impression.
Discover how BizStream helped the Portland Party Store overhaul its branding, signage, and packaging for a consistent branding experience.
Your visual brand should differentiate your company from the competition. It should be memorable, unique, and instantly recognizable, making it easier for consumers to identify and remember your brand.
A visually distinctive and memorable brand will help your company stand out in a crowded market and make a lasting impression on your target audience. When your visual brand is unique and recognizable, it creates a sense of familiarity and trust, which can lead to increased customer loyalty and brand advocacy. Additionally, a strong visual brand can help you attract new customers who are drawn to your brand’s distinct look and feel.
Overall, a differentiated, memorable, and recognizable visual brand is crucial in building a successful brand and achieving long-term business success.

Your visual brand should be adaptable to different contexts and mediums, such as print, digital, and social media. It should be designed to look great in various sizes and formats while maintaining its consistency and effectiveness. Adapting your visual brand to different mediums and formats is crucial in reaching and engaging with your target audience in today’s digital age.
Your brand’s visual elements should be optimized for various mediums such as websites, social media platforms, email marketing, mobile apps, and print materials, among others. Your visual brand should be designed to look great in different sizes and formats without compromising its consistency and effectiveness. This means that your logo, colors, typography, and other visual elements should be recognizable and consistent across all mediums and formats. Adapting your visual brand to different contexts and mediums will help you reach a wider audience and maximize the impact of your marketing efforts, leading to increased brand awareness and recognition.
See how BizStream worked with CreeMee to create an entirely new visual identity that has a modern look with vintage flair that translates well across both digital and traditional marketing channels.
Your brand experience is critical to your business’ success. By addressing these five key questions, you can ensure that your brand is complete, modern, and consistent. Investing in a strong brand identity can help you stand out from your competitors, build trust with your audience, and ultimately drive growth for your business.

Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim
Note: when I’m referring to Vim in this blog post, I’m referring to Vim Motions, not Vim the editor. Vim Motions can be enabled in most integrated development environments (IDEs) and would allow you to gain the benefits of Vim Motions without having to change your IDE. Learning the motions alone is hard enough, so don’t try to learn a new editor simultaneously (unless, of course, you really want to).
Yup, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation…
It all started just a few months ago when I randomly came across an old recording of a live stream by @realGeorgeHotz where he was writing a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) program, and I couldn’t believe how quickly he was writing code and moving through his editor. At that point in time, I had no clue he was using Vim, but it made me realize that I’m pretty slow in comparison, and I’d love to be at that level of speed someday when writing code.
The exact timeline is a bit hazy, but it couldn’t have been more than a week later that I started getting videos by @ThePrimeagen recommended to me on YouTube, who also seemed to just effortlessly fly through his code and editor. At this point, I knew something was up and came to the realization that these guys knew something I didn’t. After just a few more days of casual viewing, I finally stumbled across a video where @ThePrimeagen started raving about Vim and how effortless and fast text editing becomes once you take the time to learn it.
That was the secret sauce I couldn’t put my finger on, and I was immediately torn. Do I learn Vim, or do I avoid it like the plague? I’ve previously had coworkers on both sides of the Vim discussion; those who used it and swore by it and those who thought there was no way doing everything via your keyboard could possibly compete with the speed and efficiency of using a mouse in an editor, myself included. I went back to the original SLAM video I had watched, and sure enough, George was absolutely using Vim. It was at this moment that I realized I only had one path forward; to buckle down and get ready for the journey of learning Vim.
As much as I wish I could say, “After an hour or so, you’ll be up to speed and cruising along at the same pace as with a mouse, and after a full day, you’ll be flying around your editor like @ThePrimeagen and @realGeorgeHotz,” that’s about as far from reality as you can get.
Learning Vim is a process, and that process takes weeks of dedicated time (or months of dabbling) just to get up to the same speed as with a mouse. It’s probably one of the steepest learning curves of anything I’ve ever learned, but the payoff of learning it is extremely valuable, in my opinion.
The main reason for the extremely slow process of learning Vim is down to the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to go through just to move the cursor where you want it, copy text, paste text, etc., and it takes an extremely long time for those common actions to feel remotely close to muscle memory. I’ve been on this learning journey for nearly four months as of writing this, and to this day, I’m still having to recite the actions I want to take in my head as I’m performing them.
“Alright, down four lines, (4j), yank the line (yy), up 16 lines (16k), select the current line (V), paste over it (p).”
I look forward to the day when all of that becomes second nature because that’s when I’ll really start to fly with Vim.
Another challenge of learning Vim (which also happens to draw some parallels to learning development) is the seemingly endless methods of accomplishing whatever it is you’re attempting to do.
Let’s say you want to change the parameters of the TryParse method in the example below with your cursor starting at the beginning of the line:
If you’re new to Vim and don’t know many of the advanced motions yet, your initial thought would probably be to repeatedly press ‘w’ until you’re at the start of the word ‘role’, enter visual mode with ‘v’, repeatedly press ‘e’ until you’re at the end of the word ‘roleId’, press ‘d’ to delete what’s currently selected, then press ‘i’ to enter insert mode and start typing the replacement.
If that sounds like a lot, that’s because it is… and that approach is guaranteed to be slower than just using your mouse to make the same selection, press backspace, and then start typing the replacement. But when you’re first starting out, that’s all you know, so that’s really your only option as you don’t yet know a better way to approach it. (which is totally okay! You need to learn the basics before you start learning the more advanced stuff. You must learn to crawl before you can walk.)
With my current knowledge of Vim, if I were trying to do the same, I would first press ‘f’, followed by ‘(‘, which would find the first ‘(‘ in the line. I’d then press ‘;’ to go to the next instance of that character, this time landing on the opening parenthesis of the TryParse method call. I’d then use ‘ci(‘ to “change inside the parentheses”. This removes the text within the parenthesis I’m currently on (or in between) and puts me into insert mode immediately.
That approach is much better and is just as fast, if not faster, than trying to do the same with clicking and dragging with my mouse. In this specific case, I could likely be even faster by finding the ‘,’ character as that’s faster than finding the first ‘(‘ and having to navigate to the next one. So, with that improved approach, the full combination of keys would end up being ‘f,ci(‘, which takes no time at all to execute.
The best advice I can give with regard to the difference in approaches above is to try not to get tripped up on finding the absolute optimal approach, especially when you’re first learning. Be okay with a non-optimal approach that takes more time because you have to learn the basics no matter what. As time goes on and you get more comfortable with Vim, you can start looking into alternative approaches to performing certain actions. I find myself constantly doing things a certain way, then all of a sudden coming to the realization that there’s a better way to do whatever it was I just did. I’ll quickly undo my edits (using the ‘u’ key) and try the alternative approach I just thought of. If it feels better, I make a mental note to try and use that approach in the future when trying to accomplish that same thing again or something similar to it.
If you’d like to know where I learned most of what I know up until now, I heavily leaned on this playlist on YouTube by @ThePrimeagen.
I know there’s been a few nuggets of information that point to some of the benefits of Vim in the section above, but I’d like to do a deeper dive into some of them and also share some additional benefits I haven’t covered yet.
This benefit has already been touched on above, but I still believe it’s worth calling out in this section since it is definitely the main benefit of learning Vim. Anything that can make you a faster developer should be a no-brainer. As previously mentioned, you will be much slower when you first start. This is the most painful part of learning Vim, but once you’re equally as fast with Vim as you are with a mouse, you will have crossed the threshold of gaining all the additional benefits outlined below with the additional upside of having the ability to continually get faster and faster as time goes on.
This may seem like a strange benefit, but switching between your keyboard and mouse less frequently can have a large impact on reducing your risk of developing an RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). Every time you have to move your hand from your keyboard to your mouse, you’re putting strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The more times in a day you’re performing this action, the higher your risk for RSI’s.
If you’re still using your existing IDE when learning Vim, it’s likely you’ll still be using your mouse to navigate within your IDE. But reducing the risk of RSI’s can be further enhanced by switching to a Vim-based editor (see “Adoption of ‘better’ IDE’s” below)
This might be a bit more of a niche benefit, but this was definitely a big one for me. As someone who works on a Windows machine at work and has a macOS machine at home for personal projects, I would constantly get tripped up on Ctrl vs. Command when copying/pasting and all the differences in cursor movement between the two operating systems (Ctrl + arrows in Windows are the same as Option + arrows in macOS when moving the cursor in text files).
All this mental overhead went away once I was using Vim on both machines. Need to copy text? Just use ‘y’. Need to paste? Just use ‘p’. Need to undo? Just use ‘u’. Need to move the cursor word by word? Just use ‘w’.
You could make the argument that I just traded the mental overhead of switching between systems for the overhead of using Vim, but the beauty of Vim is that once it’s learned, the mental overhead disappears. If I had stuck with my old approach, the mental overhead would still exist every time I switch systems until the end of time.
Another small but still impactful benefit that fits within the portability benefit is the ability to edit things like config files directly on servers that you’re accessing via SSH. With Vim, you can quickly navigate and edit files when working in a GUI-less environment.
This section is extremely subjective since the best IDE for you is always going to be the one you’re most comfortable using, but there’s no harm in stepping outside your comfort zone and seeing what else might be available to you.
If I had to guess, most developers reading this are using VS Code as it has more or less become the industry standard for web development due to its extensibility afforded by their extension ecosystem. I, too, still use VS Code when writing code on Windows machines, as the Vim extension does a great job of giving me 90% of what I’m looking for. The remaining 10% is down to limitations I’ve found when it comes to navigating the IDE itself (I’m sure it’s possible to fix most, if not all, of the limitations I’ve experienced, but I haven’t taken the time to figure out how yet).
If you’re someone who loves tinkering and wants to really dive deep into making an IDE that’s tailored to your specific wants and desires, I’d recommend looking into NeoVim. I’d also recommend holding off until you’ve got the basics of Vim down before doing so. Otherwise, you’ll be trying to learn two things simultaneously, adding additional complexity.
I ended up making my own NeoVim configuration based on a handful of tutorials I watched on the topic, and I’ve found I much prefer working in my custom IDE than I do working in VS Code, but it could also be down to some additional tooling that I use that isn’t available on Windows. My current setup on my personal macOS machine consists of using my custom NeoVim editor in conjunction with tmux, which is a terminal multiplexer. This allows me to easily switch between multiple instances of NeoVim, all individually configured for the needs of each project. This makes it super easy to jump between projects and pick up wherever I had last left off and also allows each project to be set up exactly how I like it. I even have some tmux plugins set up to handle saving the state of my sessions so that after a system reboot, all my sessions are exactly how they were before the restart.
It’s also super easy to “package up” your configuration, so it’s super fast and easy to get spun up on a new machine. In my case, my tmux and NeoVim configuration files are in a repository on my GitHub, so whenever I set up a new machine, I just install NeoVim and tmux, clone my repo, create symlinks to the root of my user for the tmux and NeoVim configuration files and directories, and I’m good to go. Everything is set up exactly how I previously had it, and it took less than a few minutes. It also allows me to make updates on any of my machines, push those changes to my repo, and then pull those changes on any other machines. Because of the symlinks, those changes are applied to my system as soon as I perform a pull operation.
The biggest benefit of NeoVim and tmux, in my opinion, is that I’m able to navigate every aspect of my editor via my keyboard. This makes my development experience a dream, as all my coding can take place without ever needing to move my hands off my keyboard. It also makes it really enjoyable to work on just my laptop when I’m on the go, as I don’t need to constantly reach for the trackpad when navigating my IDE.
My hope is that this blog post has at least made you consider trying out Vim at some point, even if you’ve previously sworn off the idea of ever giving it a chance. I was in that position not too long ago, and I can tell you from experience that as long as you stick with it and give it a fair chance, you might be surprised at how beneficial it is to learn Vim. While the path to mastering Vim may seem daunting, the endless possibilities it offers in terms of speed, health benefits, and adaptability make it a skill worth acquiring. The worst that can happen is you find out you don’t like it!

Brian McKeiver
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
I joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn’t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.
That same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.
I went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).
I was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
We have a group of like-minded people here. There’s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I’m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it. When people think it can’t be done, we’ve done it.
I love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It’s what I’d do even if BizStream didn’t exist. What we do at BizStream isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s challenging, sure, but I couldn’t be in a job that wasn’t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.
It also makes me happy that we’ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the BizStream Academy — a program where we offer development training for students — and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.
I work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work, which is one of the great things about BizStream — the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I’m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.
When I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),  and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy. I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico’s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world. When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.
As a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don’t care that it’s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but I was learning what “whatever it takes” really means.
I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I’ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I’m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I’ve never met a Roulette table I didn’t like.

The Power of Effective Communication in Project Management
“Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald
Project management and communications are inseparably linked.
In the world of project management, success is often determined by the effectiveness of communication. Picture this: you’re leading a team on a complex project, juggling deadlines and client expectations. Suddenly, a critical team member is unsure about their role, and a key stakeholder feels out of the loop. The entire project starts to unravel. What could have prevented this chaos? The answer is clear communication.
In this blog post, we’ll explore how effective communication can significantly impact project management and share some real-world examples and practical tips for enhancing communication within your team.
Imagine you’re building a house. The architect, builders, electricians, and plumbers must work together seamlessly. If the architect envisions a modern masterpiece while the builder thinks rustic cottage, the result will be a disaster. In project management, clear communication ensures that everyone involved is aligned with the project’s goals and expectations.
Effective communication fosters a collaborative environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and feedback.
Projects always face unexpected challenges and changes. Consider the previous example of building a house, and imagine the project runs into geological issues. A project cannot be built successfully on a poor foundation (in this example, quite literally). If the project manager encouraged open communication, it would allow the team to quickly identify the problem and develop a new plan. This example illustrates the importance of communication in managing risks and changes.
Effective communication is not just about internal team dynamics; it also involves engaging with stakeholders.
I wouldn’t mow my lawn with a pair of scissors, and I wouldn’t cut my toast with a chainsaw. There always needs to be intentionality when choosing the right tool for the job. Similarly, utilizing the right communication tools can make or break a project. For instance, a remote team working across different time zones might rely on Slack for instant messaging, Zoom for video calls, and Asana for task management. Choosing the right tools for your team’s needs ensures seamless communication.
Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns. Encourage open dialogue by actively listening and valuing input from all team members. During a change management project I was involved with, a simple suggestion box led to a wealth of new ideas and improvements, proving that sometimes the quietest voices have the most impactful contributions.
Regular meetings help keep the team aligned and provide an opportunity to address any issues or questions. However, be mindful not to over-schedule meetings. Jeff Bezos famously adopted the “two pizza rule”: never have a meeting where two pizzas wouldn’t feed the group. Ensure each meeting has a clear purpose and agenda to avoid unnecessary gatherings.
When communicating, aim to be as clear and concise as possible. Avoid jargon and complex language that may confuse team members or stakeholders. This is particularly important within the technology industry, where audience comprehension of complex concepts may be wildly varied, even within expert teams. This can also help avoid making assumptions.
Constructive feedback is an essential component of effective communication. Provide regular feedback to team members, acknowledging their strengths and offering guidance on areas for improvement. This also means sharing and celebrating wins publicly, particularly on projects that operate within sprints, to keep up the team morale and momentum.
Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful project management. By prioritizing clear and open communication, project managers can align goals, foster collaboration, manage risks, and engage stakeholders more effectively. As a result, projects are more likely to be completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of all parties involved.Embrace the power of communication in your project management efforts, and watch as your team’s productivity and success soar to new heights. Apply this wisdom to your projects, and success will surely follow.

Communication Roles: Changing Your Approach to Fit the Situation
Effective communication is the backbone of successful project management. Nothing can build or break confidence more than the way we communicate, both with our clients and with our teams. Understanding and mastering various communication roles and knowing when to use which strategy, can enhance team collaboration and impact overall confidence. Here, we explore five key communication roles: the Expert, the Owner, the Guide, the Consultant, and the Facilitator.
The Expert role is crucial for moving projects forward with informed decisions. In this role, you provide your professional opinion backed by solid reasoning.
For example, if asked, “Why would you choose to build this website using NextJS?” a succinct response might be:“We chose NextJS for its ability to provide server-side rendering, which improves page load times and enhances SEO. Additionally, its ease of integration with various APIs and extensive community support makes it a reliable choice for our web development needs.”As an Expert, your goal is to present well-founded, singular opinions that help drive the project in the right direction.
The Owner role is about providing clear, analytical updates without delving into storytelling. This style is particularly effective for status reports. Here’s how to structure your communication as an Owner:
State your objective: “Our objective is to complete the client’s website redesign.”
Provide the current state: “We are currently on track to finish on time and have 70% of the designs completed.”
Name the next steps or timetable: “The next milestone is the final design approval, which is scheduled for next Friday.”By focusing on these elements, you ensure that your communication is concise and informative, keeping everyone aligned on progress and next steps. This is a no-fluff approach. Leave the “why” out of it.
The Guide role involves setting context and telling stories to provide clarity and direction. This is especially useful when dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks. For instance:
State the situation: “We need to estimate these user stories before the sprint kickoff on Friday.”
State the complication: “There are still some unknowns on several user stories.”
Resolution: “Can the Business Analyst please work with the dev team and possibly the client to resolve these unknowns so we can complete the estimation?”
By framing the situation this way, you help your team understand the broader context and the importance of resolving specific issues, thereby guiding them toward effective solutions. Where the Owner role avoids the use of “Why”, the guide uses “Why” or context to help explain the difficulties and nuance of a tough situation.
Ideally, this is used outside of stand-ups, which are intended to be short and concise.
The Consultant role is about empowering others to take action, making it ideal for client interactions. When presenting options, avoid solving the problem outright. For example:State the situation: “Our sprint kickoff is at the end of the week, and we need to share our total estimate with the client.”State the complication: “The estimated effort is higher than we estimated during the sales process.”
Option 1: “We can look for a less complicated solution.”
Option 2: “We could consider cutting out some less important features.”
Option 3: “We could look for additional budget if everything is needed and no changes are possible.”
If asked, you can then provide your recommended resolution. This approach empowers clients and team members to weigh their options and make informed decisions. It leverages the expertise of all parties but gives room for personal opinions and overall collaboration.
The Facilitator role is essential for gaining buy-in from the wider team, especially when dealing with less appealing tasks. Consider this scenario:Situation: “We need to maintain legacy services for several of our clients.”Complication: “These services run on an old server that we need to decommission, but moving them requires updating those existing services.”Ask a question: “How do you think we should handle this situation?”By posing a question, you invite input and collaboration, which can be particularly effective in overcoming resistance and ensuring team commitment to necessary but less exciting tasks. This is also helpful when your role is identifying issues, but you personally lack the expertise on how to resolve the problem. It is similar to the consultative approach but is more hands-off in providing a solution.
Mastering these five communication roles—Expert, Owner, Guide, Consultant, and Facilitator—can greatly enhance the effectiveness of your communication within the scope of a project. Each role serves a specific purpose and, when used appropriately, can lead to better project outcomes, stronger team collaboration, and more satisfied stakeholders. Try some of these strategies out the next time you find yourself in a situation that requires a nuanced approach to communication.

Generating Realistic Test Files for Secure and Comprehensive Application Testing
In software development, generating test files is essential for various scenarios, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Creating realistic test data that mimics production data allows developers to thoroughly test and debug their applications in a controlled environment while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
I have been working on the YouthCenter application by BizStream for a while. YouthCenter is a comprehensive juvenile case management system used by organizations such as juvenile probation, courts, and detention centers. Recently, I needed to implement a feature to facilitate file migration within the application. Using live production data was not an option due to the risk of exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data protected under regulations like HIPAA. Instead, I generated a variety of documents, including Word files, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, and images. This approach allowed me to test the application effectively without compromising real data, providing a reliable testing ground that closely resembled real-world usage.
One of the main advantages of using generated test files is the ability to create realistic data sets that closely mimic real-world scenarios without exposing sensitive information. This ensures comprehensive testing of various application functionalities, such as file processing, uploads, and migrations, under conditions that reflect actual usage. It helps identify and fix potential issues that may only surface with large and varied data sets. Moreover, generating diverse file types and structures ensures that the application can handle different data formats and edge cases effectively. This method also supports performance testing by simulating high data loads, helping optimize the application’s performance and scalability. Ultimately, it enhances the reliability and robustness of the application, ensuring it performs well in production environments.
For the example below, the file generator will generate as many files as the user needs. File names and the content of the files are all generated. My personal preference is Bacon Ipsum, but the generation call can be modified to call any Ipsum service you would like.
To effectively generate various types of files for testing purposes, our code is organized into several key components:
This modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.
The base class, FileGenerator, provides common functionality for all file generators, such as generating random text and images. It also defines an abstract method Generate that each specific file generator must implement. This file requires the RestSharp package to make HTTP requests and Bogus for generating random data.
The FileGenerator class is an abstract base class that provides methods for generating random text and images. It includes an abstract method, Generate, that each derived class must implement. The GetBaconIpsumTextAsync method fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API using RestSharp, while the GetRandomImage method generates a random image with specified dimensions. The GetRandomFileName method uses the Bogus library to generate random file names.
File Path: Generators/FileGenerator.cs
This modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.
The DocxGenerator class is responsible for generating Word documents. It uses the DocX library to create and manipulate Word documents. The class inherits from FileGenerator and implements the Generate method, which creates a new Word document, inserts random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API, and saves the document to the specified path.File Path: Generators/DocxGenerator.cs
The XlsxGenerator class handles generating Excel spreadsheets using the ClosedXML library. It follows the same pattern as the DocxGenerator class, fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API and populating the Excel sheet with random words. The class ensures that the generated file is saved correctly to the specified path.
File Path: Generators/XlsxGenerator.cs
The CsvGenerator class generates CSV files by fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, splitting it into words, and organizing it into a grid format. This class ensures the generated CSV files contain varied and realistic data, making them suitable for testing. I did not do any handling for commas in the Ipsum data returned, so data in the CSV files could potentially be misaligned. This was acceptable for my testing purposes, but can be handled within this generator if needed.
File Path: Generators/CsvGenerator.cs
The TxtGenerator class creates plain text files filled with random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API. This class ensures the generated text files are populated with realistic content, aiding in comprehensive testing.
File Path: Generators/TxtGenerator.cs
The PdfGenerator class handles generating PDF files using the PdfSharp library. It fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, breaks it into lines that fit within the page width, and adds new pages as needed to accommodate the text. This class ensures that the generated PDFs are filled with realistic, multi-page content.
File Path: Generators/PdfGenerator.cs
The FolderPathGenerator class is responsible for generating random folder paths and ensuring they exist. This utility class helps manage the organization of generated files by creating new directories and keeping track of existing ones. This class ensures that each file generated can be placed in a randomly chosen folder, either new or pre-existing.
File Path: Utilities/FolderPathGenerator.cs
The ImageGenerator class is responsible for generating image files. It uses the .NET System.Drawing library to create images with random colors. This generator is useful for creating test image files that can be used to simulate image uploads and processing in applications. The images generated by this code may not be anything stunning (solid canvas in a random RGB color), but the files have proper formatting to be able to be opened in an image viewing application.File Path: Generators/ImageGenerator.cs
The main program of the application serves as the entry point and coordinates the entire file generation process. It begins by setting the root path for file generation to the user’s desktop and prompts the user for the number of files to generate. The program then initializes an array of file generators, each capable of creating a specific type of file, such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images.
In a loop that runs for the specified number of files, the program randomly decides whether to create a new folder or use an existing one for each file. It selects a random file generator from the array and generates a file with a random name and appropriate extension in the chosen directory. The program ensures asynchronous operations complete before proceeding, providing an efficient and organized way to generate a diverse set of test files. This setup simulates real-world file handling scenarios, enhancing the robustness and comprehensiveness of application testing.File Path: Program.cs
Creating an application to generate various types of test files (such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images) ensures that developers can produce realistic and diverse data sets without using sensitive production data. This process is particularly useful for testing features like file processing, uploads, and migrations, allowing for comprehensive testing while maintaining data privacy and security. The application is organized into key components: a base file generator class, specific file generators for each file type, and utility classes. The main program coordinates the file generation process by prompting the user for the number of files to generate and leveraging these file generators to create content. By dynamically deciding whether to create new directories or use existing ones, the program effectively simulates real-world file organization. This setup enhances testing reliability, helping developers identify and fix potential issues, ultimately improving the application’s robustness and performance in production environments.

Transforming User Engagement: Advanced Search Functionality in Healthcare
Robust search functionality on a healthcare website ensures patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals can access the necessary information quickly. In an industry where timely access to accurate information can significantly impact outcomes, an intuitive search tool enhances user experience and builds trust in your website as a reliable resource.
The primary audience includes patients searching for symptoms, treatments, and healthcare services; caregivers seeking guidance on supporting loved ones; and healthcare professionals needing quick access to medical resources and research. Specific searches might include finding nearby specialists, managing chronic conditions, or accessing clinical guidelines. Efficient search functionality ensures these users find the precise information they need, improving their overall experience.
Here are some key points to consider when developing robust search functionality:
Ensuring the search functionality is user-friendly involves clear design and intuitive navigation. Best practices include placing the search bar in a prominent location, offering auto-suggestions to guide users, and providing filters to refine results. Consider the readability and accessibility of the search interface, making sure it caters to users of all ages and technical abilities.
With the increasing use of mobile devices, optimizing search functionality for mobile is essential. A mobile-friendly search tool should be responsive, load quickly, and have touch-friendly elements. Voice search capabilities can also be a significant advantage, allowing users to search hands-free, which is particularly useful in healthcare settings.
Implementing multi-faceted searching allows users to filter results based on various criteria such as location, specialty, condition, and treatment type. This helps users narrow down their search results to the most relevant information quickly. Offering a range of filters and sorting options ensures that users can customize their search experience to meet their specific needs.
Semantic search capabilities enhance the search experience by understanding the context and intent behind a user’s query rather than just matching keywords. This leads to more accurate and relevant search results, as the search tool can interpret natural language queries and recognize synonyms, related terms, and the context of medical terminology. For example, a search for “heart attack” would also return results for “myocardial infarction,” ensuring comprehensive information retrieval.
Providing multi-language search capabilities is essential for catering to a diverse audience. It ensures that non-English speaking users can access information in their preferred language, enhancing inclusivity and accessibility. This is particularly important in healthcare, where understanding medical information accurately can significantly impact health outcomes. Implementing multi-language search capabilities can also improve the user experience for international patients or caregivers seeking information about medical conditions and treatments.
A well-organized data and content structure is fundamental to an effective search tool. Information should be categorized and tagged appropriately to ensure search queries return accurate results. Using standardized medical terminology and ensuring consistency across all content helps improve search accuracy and relevance.
Integrating search analytics and reporting capabilities allows website administrators to monitor and analyze user search behavior. This data provides insights into what users are looking for, which search terms are most popular, and where users might be encountering difficulties. These insights can inform content creation, website improvements, and overall user experience enhancements. For instance, if a significant number of users search for information on a specific condition, it might indicate a need for more comprehensive content on that topic.
Deciding between a custom-built search tool and an out-of-the-box solution depends on your specific needs and resources. Custom tools offer tailored functionalities and can integrate seamlessly with your existing systems but may require more time and investment. Out-of-the-box solutions are quicker to implement and can be cost-effective, though they might lack some customization options.
An efficient search functionality helps patients connect to the information and services they need faster, enhancing their overall experience. Quick access to relevant health information, appointment scheduling, and specialist directories means patients spend less time searching and more time addressing their health concerns, leading to better health outcomes and patient satisfaction. Implementing these advanced search capabilities can significantly enhance the usability and effectiveness of a healthcare website, ensuring that users can connect with the information and resources they need more easily and efficiently. This leads to better health outcomes, increased patient satisfaction, and a stronger reputation for the healthcare provider.
BizStream recently took on the challenge of enhancing Prevea Health’s website, focusing on improving its search functionality. This project underscores the importance of robust search capabilities on healthcare websites, ensuring users can quickly access vital information.
By building a custom search tool using Microsoft Azure AI Search, BizStream aimed to refine provider and location search capabilities, optimize mobile search experiences, and boost overall search speed and accuracy.
Leveraging Azure Search indexes and integrating with the Prevea Mobile App, BizStream delivered a streamlined, fast user experience. Key achievements included:
These enhancements also significantly improved content management, reduced duplicated content, and provided a robust framework for Prevea Health’s internal teams to manage. The collaboration between BizStream and Prevea Health ensured a modernized, efficient website that better serves its users.For more details, visit the Prevea Health project page.

Xperience by Kentico: A Breath of Fresh Air
Over the last few months, I’ve had the pleasure of starting to get my feet wet with Kentico’s latest DXP offering, Xperience by Kentico. And when I say it’s been a pleasure to work with, I really mean it. The sheer speed of everything (and not just the administration application), combined with an excellent developer experience and an active, growing community surrounding it, makes Xperience by Kentico a breath of fresh air for content administrators and developers alike.
One of the first things you’re likely to notice when working with a site that’s been built using Xperience, is the incredible speed at which you can navigate and manage your site(s). If you’ve worked with Kentico sites in the past, I can assure you that Xperience’s administration interface is a massive leap forward.
Outside of using the administrative application itself, there’s still so much more to love. One of the great aspects of this new platform is the rate at which new features are being added to the product. There’s monthly “refreshes”, as they’re called, and each one is packed full of new features for both content administrators and developers.
Speaking of developers, one of the biggest speed improvements is found in the act of building and running the site. Gone are the days of waiting 30+ seconds for a heavy CMS administration site to spin up and initialize in order to validate that your changes are working as expected. Since Xperience has been built using .NET Core and React, it takes only a few seconds to go from dotnet watch to interacting with your site.
Sticking with the topic of developers, there’s so many aspects of the new Xperience platform that give it an excellent developer experience.
One of the things I’ve come to appreciate the most about Xperience is the plethora of things that can be accomplished via the .NET CLI. From the usage of dotnet templates for spinning up a new site, to using the kentico-xperience-dbmanager for spinning up databases, and a handful of flags that can be used with dotnet run in order to update the database version and execute Kentico CI and CD commands. There’s even CLI commands to generate code based on the content types, forms, reusable field schemas, and module classes that are built within the DXP to be used by your presentation site’s code.
Due to all the application management that can be done from the CLI, it makes building, configuring, and extending the CI/CD configuration for your solution extremely easy and straightforward. Combine that with the fact that everything is based on .NET Core now, making it so the underlying build agent can be Linux, and you’ve got yourself a recipe for incredibly fast builds and releases.
One of the powerful things we’ve been able to implement on our projects (which is a bit of a copy of what’s been done on the Kentico Community Portal site), which is the idea of spinning up a SQL Server instance, restoring a database backup, running Kentico CI Restore to get the database in sync with the latest changes, then running Kentico CD Store in order to serialize whatever files are needed on the destination machine in order to run the Kentico CD Restore command post-deployment to sync up any object or content changes that need to exist 🤯. That may sound like a lot, and you might need to re-read that a few times to follow everything that’s happening, but it’s been a powerful way to generate the CD files as part of the build process, rather than needing developers to continuously commit those files to the repository, which will be changing for each deployment, and are more or less duplicates of many of the CI files that are already present in the repository.
You may be wondering though, “doesn’t all that drastically slow down your CI/CD builds?”. If we were still using Windows build agents, then yes, because I was seeing build times in the 10-12 minute range when including these database and serialization steps. But when building on Linux agents, it’s able to build the solution, run all the steps above, and publish the results as an artifact in just 2.5 minutes on average. That’s about a 2x-3x speed improvement over just building .NET Framework solutions back in the day.
The points above obviously already hit on some of the benefits of being on modern tech like .NET Core, but the conversation doesn’t end there. If you’ve worked on a Kentico site recently, you likely know that whenever you needed to make any customizations to the administration interface, you were required to do so by building out your UI and backend logic using Web Forms. Compare that to Xperience, where your customizations are all built using React, a modern and widely adopted Javascript framework.
One of the biggest benefits of being on a modern tech stack like .NET Core and React, is the fact that more developers are familiar with these technologies and will be better equipped to build and maintain sites that are built using them. I would also wager that it’s easier to find new developers with React experience than it is finding ones with Web Forms experience, so easier hiring can also be a great potential downstream effect of moving to a platform like Xperience.
If you’ve ever worked on a brand new platform that didn’t have great documentation or had a small number of people building with it, you know the pain of feeling stuck with nowhere to go. Thankfully, the Xperience community and platform are mature enough to provide you with everything you need to build out excellent digital experiences without the dreadful feeling of being alone.
The first place you can turn to would be the extremely thorough documentation about the platform. Nearly everything you would need to know about using the administration interface as a content administrator, or building out websites or email channels and all the components that go along with each, can be found within the Xperience Documentation site.
If you happen to strike out with finding what you need in the documentation, the next best place to look would be the Kentico Community Portal. This is a great resource due to the information that can be found within the blog posts, as well as the Q&A section of the site. If you can’t find an existing question that matches whatever it is you’re running into, you can create an account and ask away!
In the unlikely event that both options above don’t pan out, you can always join the Kentico Xperience Community Slack Organization. The members of this Slack Organization are quick to provide their thoughts and ideas when questions are asked in their respective channels.
As you can hopefully deduce from the points above, there’s a lot to love about the Xperience platform. Regardless of if you’ve worked on Kentico projects in the past, I would highly recommend giving Xperience a closer look if you haven’t already. As someone who has helped develop a couple different types of projects in recent months, I’ve been able to do a deep dive into Xperience, and I’m incredibly excited to continue building projects with it for years to come.
Check out this video to hear BizStream team members share their experiences and insights on using Xperience by Kentico.

Five Takeaways from Config 2024
I had the amazing opportunity to attend Figma’s annual conference, Config, in San Francisco, CA. It was great to be among thousands of fellow designers, developers, and other creative folks. Figma puts on quite a show; from the physical signage inside and outside the conference hall, to the amazing motion graphics between sessions. Everything was on brand and super cool! Check it out…
Figma has unveiled a major redesign of their app’s UI, code named: UI3. The goal of UI3 is to enhance Figma by focusing on key improvements: it prioritizes user ideas over the UI, balances the interface for both new and professional users, adapts to modern design practices with reusable components and generative AI, and lays the groundwork for future tools like Figma Slides while integrating design and code through Dev Mode and Figma AI.
Learn more about Figma UI3
People have been creating slide presentations in Figma for many years. However, it wasn’t a native aspect of the tool. So, features like “presenter notes” and easy reordering of slides weren’t available. That’s no longer the case because Figma Slides were announced at Config 2024! Figma Slides is a user-friendly presentation tool for all team members, making it easy to create and collaborate on slide decks for design reviews, startup pitches, class projects, and conference talks. It supports real-time collaboration, ensuring decks are always up-to-date without the need to save or share multiple versions. Plus, shared asset libraries can be used in your presentations!
Learn more about Figma Slides
In a nod to artificial intelligence’s growing influence, Figma introduced AI-powered design assistance tools under the banner of Figma AI. These tools allow for visual search, automatic layer renaming, relevant content generation, instant background removal, copy rewriting, and translation.
Learn more about Figma AI
Figma announced updates to Dev Mode and Code Connect. Dev Mode now has statuses, which show the current handoff state of designs, including designer notes and changes. The statuses include “Ready for dev,” “Changed,”, and “Completed.” Code Connect bridges your component codebase to Figma, integrating your design system component code directly into Dev Mode. It allows you to preview example components that reflect your production framework, displaying real-world code snippets.
Learn more about Dev Mode and Code Connect
Changing an existing design with many objects within it to Auto Layout would often lead to shifts in the design and require some rework to function as intended. But now, when you use the Suggest Auto Layout feature, Figma analyzes which objects in a frame or component should be placed within an auto layout frame. It then adds the necessary auto layout frames to make the entire design responsive. These frames are created simultaneously, aiming to preserve the original placement of your designs. Awesome!
Learn more about Suggest Auto Layout
Config 2024 has once again demonstrated Figma’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in design. From more powerful layout tools and interactive components to AI-driven assistance, these updates are set to enhance productivity, creativity, and collaboration for design teams around the globe. As we integrate these new features into our workflows, we look forward to a more efficient, innovative, and enjoyable design process for ourselves and our clients.

How I Learned to Foster Growth in a Company of Brilliant Minds
If you haven’t caught on yet, BizStream does things a little differently than your average company.  One of those things is that we’re pretty big on our core values. Picture this: we gather for our company-wide Monday Pulse meeting every Monday. It’s our weekly ritual where we look back at the past week, figure out where we’re at, and peer into the future to see where we’re heading. It’s like our Monday morning GPS, helping us zero in on what matters most for the week ahead.
If you haven’t caught on yet, BizStream does things a little differently than your average company. One of those things is that we’re pretty big on our core values, which include “Whatever It Takes,” “Work Hard, Play Hard,” “We Are a Team,” “Be Fearless,” “Foster Growth in Others,” “Care,” and “Be Positive.” Picture this: we gather for our company-wide Monday Pulse meeting every Monday. It’s our weekly ritual where we look back at the past week, figure out where we’re at, and peer into the future to see where we’re heading. It’s like our Monday morning GPS, helping us zero in on what matters most for the week ahead.
Here’s the twist: once every few weeks, we take a slight detour from the routine and dive deep into one of our core values. We’re not just talking about it for the sake of it; we make it a bit personal. We throw a curveball and select a random team member to delve into that core value. It’s like we’re peeling back the curtain on our values to see what it means to others. This helps solidify and grant perspective you might not always have if it was just a bunch of words bantered about on company letterhead or plastered to the break room wall.
So, guess what? Yours truly got the opportunity to shed light on “Fostering Growth in Others” recently. Now, usually, I’m all in for these sessions, but this one felt a bit different.
Every year, during our annual reviews, we’re handed the scorecard and asked to rate ourselves against our core values. It’s a bit like holding up a mirror, a chance to see if we’re still in sync with the company and its values. Now, when it comes to “Fostering Growth,” I’ve found myself in a bit of a loop, marking myself down or feeling like I’m grappling with it. Why? Well, BizStream attracts extremely smart and intelligent people, and here I am, just the IT guy who is self-made and has no extraordinary degree or training. How on earth can I fan the flames of growth in a sea of already brilliant minds?
I pondered this for a week. How do I articulate this core value when I’m not entirely sure if I’m playing the game right? Luckily, I had some time to mull it over (props to whoever gave me the heads-up).
I wasn’t getting anywhere, so I did a little etymology and looked up the word foster.  Here is what it said:
Well, that is interesting – nowhere did it shout “knowledge.” Surprising, right? Until then, I had this idea that I needed to be this knowledge wizard, dropping wisdom bombs left and right. But nope, it’s more about being the spark, igniting that curiosity to dig deeper.
This newfound perspective got me excited. How can I be that spark? How can I light a fire under folks to grow their ideas? Then, I stumbled upon a gem from Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of Treasure Island. He said, “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.” Bingo! Fostering growth is all about planting that seed, that spark, and letting it grow.
I don’t have to be the Einstein of the room. I just need to pass along that contagious energy to learn something new. Even if they don’t pick up exactly what I’m into, it’s the act of learning itself that matters. So, armed with this fresh perspective, I threw it all into a presentation. I had no clue how it would land, but I wanted to share it, to pass on that spark, and hope it’d make someone want to dig deeper.
I think it landed where I wanted it to, and everyone understood where I was coming from.
I hope this little journey sparks something in you – a spark to dive deeper and share your own fire. Because at the end of the day, fostering growth is about passing on that spark, embracing the excitement of learning, and seeing where it takes you. Cheers to growth!

Brian McKeiver Speaking at Beer City Code 2024
Join Brian McKeiver, co-owner and solution architect at BizStream, as he takes the stage at the Beer City Code Conference in Grand Rapids, MI, on August 3, 2024.
Beer City Code is an annual conference for software developers held in Grand Rapids, MI, also known as Beer City, USA. Software creators of all types are welcome, even those who don’t care for beer. The main conference is held on Saturday, August 3, with optional day-long workshops the day before, Friday, August 2. The Beer City Code conference grew out of the success of its predecessor, Grand Rapids DevDay, but was renamed in 2017 to embrace its much broader appeal outside the Grand Rapids area.

To help simplify cloud app complexity, Microsoft has introduced .NET Aspire. It includes a curated set of components that make sense to use in your C# projects. .NET Aspire makes it easy to discover, acquire, and configure essential dependencies for cloud-native apps from the very beginning of your project. Join Brian to walk through the setup and usage of this new, powerful tool that can make any .NET developer more efficient in delivering cloud-native applications.

Brand Refinement: Small Changes, Big Impact
We love working on and completely redesigning brands here at BizStream. However, for some clients, working through a full brand redesign may not be the right business decision for their marketing or business goals. For these clients, we suggest a brand refinement instead.
Brand refinement is a strategic decision that builds on the clients’ existing brand, no matter how much or how little of the brand may exist. The primary goal of a brand refinement is to fix or improve the parts of the brand that need updating while maintaining the brand recognition and brand equity that already exists with the current brand.
A brand refinement follows the same process as a full brand redesign. The main difference is that the amount of the brand that is modified or updated at each step is more streamlined.
The branding process includes working through each of the following steps:
Any project we work on requires some research and discovery. During this step, we take time to get to know and understand your business, your competitors, your customers’ needs, and what makes your business unique. We will also discuss how you use your brand in various media and the issues you are having.
For brand refinement we will:
For the messaging platform, we will examine how you talk about your company and how you differentiate yourself in the marketing materials you produce. We will also work on developing your brand story and determining the key messages that best support it.
For brand refinement we will:
During the brand identity step, we will examine your brand’s core visuals, including your logo, color palette, and typography to the graphic elements and photographic imagery you use. Think of these as the “parts and pieces” of your brand. This step is very exciting as the first visual aspects of the brand start to take shape.
For brand refinement we will:
The visual brand experience is how the “parts and pieces” of your brand identity are uniquely put together for your brand. The visual brand experience step is all about developing the custom layouts, design elements, and photography treatments for all of your marketing materials and customer touchpoints. We like to call these custom treatments and layouts your “brand expressions.”
This is one of the most fun parts of any brand project. During this step, there is a lot of visual exploration, trying out different combinations of colors, fonts, graphic elements, and imagery to see which treatments are the most compelling and effective.
For brand refinement we will:
Once decisions have been made for your messaging, brand identity, and brand expressions, these choices need to be documented for use going forward. The brand consistency step is all about defining your brand standards to ensure consistency and maintain the integrity of your brand. This often takes the form of a brand guide that can be used internally or externally with any vendor who will need to work with your brand.
For brand refinement we will:
Ultimately, the strategy behind any brand update should be guided by a clear vision for the future of your brand and a deep understanding of your customers and your business goals. By taking a thoughtful and strategic approach to refining your brand, you can position yourself for long-term success and ensure that your brand remains relevant and impactful for years to come.
We’d love to help you with your next branding project. View our brand work or contact us to get started!

Growing a Better Brand
Countryside Greenhouse has been a staple of the Allendale community for many decades. From their humble beginnings to their current status as a thriving retail hub, they have become a cherished staple in the region. However, over these years of growth and expansion their logo, messaging, and overall brand experience hasn’t quite grown along with them. Countryside Greenhouse partnered with BizStream, a local branding and website agency, to help them refresh their brand and redesign their website to match.
For many years, Countryside Greenhouse has worked with BizStream for their website needs. Early in 2023, Countryside Greenhouse came to BizStream knowing they wanted to update their website. What portions needed to be updated, and how much they needed to be updated was all discussed. During these talks the subject of the Countryside Greenhouse brand also came up. BizStream presented the idea that if we strengthened and improved the brand, redesigning and updating the Countryside Greenhouse website would be much easier, and better. Plus, the brand improvements would help with Countryside Greenhouse’s outward marketing needs as well.
BizStream led the Countryside Greenhouse team through a series of brand exercises in order to hone in on brand attributes that fit with where they wanted the brand to go, brand pillars that help set them apart from their competitors, and who their target audience segments are. These steps helped set the stage for the BizStream design team to start exploring where the visuals of the brand would go and create alignment for everyone involved.
After exploring some various directions for the Countryside Greenhouse logo, it was decided that some updates definitely needed to be made, but the logo should also feel somewhat familiar to longtime customers. So the symbol of the three flowers was retained, but simplified and cleaned up, to better fit with the rest of the brand.To liven things up, more colors were added to the color palette, more stylized brand fonts were chosen, and brand graphic elements (flower and leaf outlines) were introduced to the brand. All of these brand assets give the Countryside Greenhouse marketing team more options as they put together billboards and social posts.
The brand updates were used to inform the website redesign as well. Adding in more of the new brand colors, brand graphics, and updated brand fonts helps give the whole site a more friendly and inviting feel. These improvements, in combination with the simplified navigation, and overhauled gift card purchasing process, has made the user experience of the Countryside Greenhouse website much better and more inline with what Countryside Greenhouse customers would expect from a brand of their kind.
Flowers and plants make people happy. They are used to add color to drab spaces, and bring life and vibrancy to mundane yards and landscapes. The reinvigorated Countryside Greenhouse brand and digital presence aim to do the same—bring a little joy into customers’ lives, and put a smile on their faces. Experience the magic of Countryside Greenhouse today and discover why they’re the premier destination for all your gardening, landscaping, and potting essentials.
BizStream crafted a new brand identity and visual experience that better suits who Countryside Greenhouse is as a company and resonates more strongly with their target audience.
Ready to amp up your digital presence? Our expert designers blend creativity with user-centric strategies, ensuring your brand not only engages but resonates with your target audience. Contact us to get started!

How to Integrate .NET 8 Blazor Server Components with Kentico Xperience
This past November, Microsoft released the highly anticipated .NET 8. But what makes this release so significant? To understand this, we must first look back. Up to and including .NET 7, Blazor offered two hosting models for building web applications.
Blazor Server, which renders the content on the server and relies on a socket connection to handle any UI interactions. Those interactions are sent back to the server over the socket to be handled by the server. This allows the server to have a quick initial load but because of the socket, it is prone to errors if there are any network or latency issues.
Blazer Web Assembly (WASM) has a better browser experience because the application is packaged up and runs directly in the browser but at the cost of a large initial load. It also requires a separate web API to handle any backend interactions.
.NET 8 still uses these hosting models but has introduced new rendering modes that give you much more flexibility on how you can display your components. With the new Interactive Auto rendering mode, you can start with Interactive Blazor Server SSR and then be handed off to the Blazor WASM bundle once that finishes downloading. This allows you to get the best of both worlds.
Yes, there are many other improvements, but these are the ones I’m excited about.
One thing I love about the Blazor Razor Components is that you can easily use them on established sites. In my example, I’m going to add a new Component to Kentico’s Dancing Goat Sample site.
Kentico added support for .NET 8 with the release of Kentico 13 refresh 11 however, the installer still uses .NET 6 for Dancing Goat. This is an easy change. Just update the TargetFramework in the DancingGoat.csproj file to use .NET 8 instead of 6.
Edit the Startup.cs to add the Blazor Services
This step is just a preference to keep my components organized and differentiate them from other ViewComponents that already exist on the site.
For my example, I’ve chosen to create a component to display the list of cafes on the Cafe Section page.
Create a new file in the Blazor components folder named CafesComponent.razor.
We are going to convert the list of cafes in the View/Cafes/Index.cshtml file into our new component. Copy the code from the source Dancing Goat view into our new component; it should be about lines 6 through 30. We’ll also create a new parameter so we can pass the cafes to the component. Our final output should look like the one below.
@cafe.Contact.Phone
@cafe.Note
Now that we have our new component created, we can implement it in the Cafes section View. To do that, we simply delete the code that we copied from the .cshtml file and call our CafesComponent.
Now, it’s ready to build and run.
Incorporating a bit of Blazor into your Kentico Xperience 13 site is an excellent way to explore the new technology without committing to a complete site overhaul. This gradual approach allows you to experiment with Blazor’s features, such as its component-based architecture and reusable UI elements, making it easier to add interactive features to your application.
By integrating Blazor alongside your existing MVC framework, you can see how it improves the overall functionality and performance of your site. This method provides valuable insights into how Blazor fits into your development workflow, helping you decide if further integration is right for your project.

3 Under-utilized Kentico Marketing Features
At Bizstream, we build a lot of websites, many of which are on the CMS platform Kentico. We’ve helped many clients use some of Kentico’s best features. Page builder widgets for example, make content creation extremely easy for marketers. Widgets let content admins drag and drop, copy and paste, and rearrange content with only a few clicks.
On the flip side, we see a lot of great features that are often underutilized in Kentico. Some of these features might not be useful for every company, but many would do well to add them to their marketing arsenal. We’re going to be looking at three:
Using these tools, marketing teams can greatly expand their understanding of their customers and create more targeted and relevant content.
A/B testing is when you display two types of marketing content to different audiences to see which performs better. For instance, a website may be performing an A/B test for the image used on a specific featured item.
A/B testing is one of the most under-utilized features in marketing. Instead of spending time arguing internally whether a page should feature an image or a video, creating an A/B test and seeing which one performs the best can give you fast and accurate results. You may find one beats the other by a landslide, or you may find there is hardly any difference at all.
First, A/B testing needs to be set up in order for content admins to be able to use it. Once enabled, content admins need only to go to the page they would like to create an A/B test on and select “Create an A/B Test”. This will open a modal that will then allow the content admin to configure, start, and evaluate the A/B test.
First, just as we all learned in science class, you can only test one variable at a time. If you create an A/B test with several different elements between the two pages, you won’t know why one performed better than the other. As you can see in the image above, the only difference between the two tests is that one has an image, and one has a video.
A/B tests should have a limited duration. Get the answers you are looking for, then choose the better performing test. If you’ve had 5000 site visitors since beginning the test and 70% chose option A and 30% chose option B, that is plenty of data to know which to go with. Keeping an A/B test running for too long can hurt SEO.
While you should only have one primary difference between any given A/B test, you can (and should) have multiple A/B tests going at any given time. Once you know which option is performing better or if there is no significant difference, iterate on the last test to continue improving your content. This will allow you to continue learning from your customers about what content they like and don’t like.
For many companies and organizations, they don’t have a single type of audience coming to their website. Different audience types viewing your site may not overlap in user behavior, interests, attributes, and characteristics. As a marketer, you want to show content relevant to the customers viewing the site, not content that is irrelevant to them.
This creates a challenge for marketers since it seems like your choices are either to show multiple types of content (which means showing things to users who don’t want to see it) or only show generic content that could be for everyone but that isn’t as helpful for anyone.
This is where personas prove their worth. Personas allow marketers to easily segment users by their behavior and attributes and then tailor content to those users based on the persona they fall into.
For example, let’s say you have a company that sells running shoes. One audience type is for someone who is simply looking for a new pair of shoes. Let’s call that audience “New Buyers”. Another known customer is someone who is looking for races that you have listed on the site. This audience is called “Racers”. Finally, there are some customers that are raving fans of your brand and often buy merchandise and specialized shoes that have a limited amount made. Let’s call this audience “Loyalty Customers”.
In Kentico, content admins can define these personas by assigning “points” to a user who matches certain attributes and behaviors. Personas are then set at a threshold and once a user meets that threshold, they are added to that group. For example, let’s set up the following point values and thresholds for our three user groups.
– Opens a product page – 66 points
– Comes from selecting an advertisement – 80 points
– Selects an events detail page – 34 points
– Submits a form to keep updated on racing events – 75 points
– Registers for an event – 100 points
– Selects a limited shoe product – 51 points
– Purchases a limited limited shoe product – 100 points
Let’s say a user comes to the site and does the following:
This user would receive 146 points for being a new buyer and 109 points for the Racer’s audience. Since the user is further past the New Buyer threshold as a percentage, Kentico will place them in that persona.
Content admins can then use this knowledge to create specific content to that persona type through their site, email blasts, and campaigns, giving users content that is specific and relevant to them.
Kentico offers campaigns to track and measure traffic to your site using cookies. This helps content admins see which marketing strategies are most successful and which aren’t working. Similar to tracking personas, campaigns let admins define conversions by their actions on your site.
Campaigns can be used to promote a new product or simply to attract more users to your site. Once a campaign is running, content admins can see the number of visitors who came through it and how many were ultimately converted.
Okay, it is not Kentico-specific, but I need to call this one out as a bonus item. You may be saying to yourself, GA4 is not an under-utilized feature, every site has GA4 these days. Maybe, but how well do your marketers actually use it? Do they know what they are tracking? More importantly, do they know what the data they are tracking means? More importantly still, are they listening to what the data is telling them? If you answered no to any of these questions, I would argue that you are not using Google Analytics to its full potential.
Kentico, like many CMSs, has many great features. Some may take more time getting used to or figuring out how to use them, but the ROI can make it well worth the time. A/B testing, personas, and campaigns are all powerful tools for elevating your marketing and website game to the next level.

Brian McKeiver Speaking at iJS 2024
Join Brian McKeiver, co-owner and solution architect at BizStream, as he takes the stage at the International JavaScript Conference in San Diego or online from May 20–23, 2024.
The International JavaScript Conference (iJS) is a worldwide gathering for JavaScript developers, held annually in cities like San Diego. Dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, iJS offers a platform to stay ahead in the ever-evolving JavaScript world. Covering topics from Angular and React to WebAssembly, from Progressive Web Apps to JAMstack, renowned experts share insights on the present and future of JavaScript. It’s a full-stack conference where attendees can broaden their knowledge, network with fellow JS enthusiasts, and embrace the latest trends.
Using a Headless and API-First approach comes with a problem. With only an API (or multiple) to start with, how do you know you are building your project codebase (“head”) to account for best practices such as caching, security, and best performance. How do you know what path offers to allow for the most flexibility with the least amount of headaches? It isn’t the same as just having a database and template engine on the backend. SaaS-based headless solutions are a powerful way to build modern enterprise-class websites and they are also becoming more popular by the day. Luckily, multiple solutions have now been built around these “API first” platforms. Some best practice architecture patterns have emerged as a result, and this session aims to share them. Attendees will see and learn these patterns for designing, building, and deploying Headless based solutions. They’ll leave the session with proven architecture patterns and how to apply them when working with a Headless CMS and API first stack.

Keeping a Pulse on Your Projects: A Guide to Evaluating Health and Profitability in Web Development
A somewhat not-so-well-known Project Management statistic is that an average of about 36–49% of projects fail to deliver on what was initially promised to customers. That’s a terrible statistic, and as someone who has spent years managing projects, it’s not one I want to be associated with.
In the dynamic world of web development, aligning project execution with business objectives is crucial. Working at an agency, ensuring that projects are not only completed to the client’s expectations but also profitable requires a vigilant approach. This blog post outlines a systematic method to evaluate your web development projects, focusing on financial alignment, project execution, client interaction, and team feedback. Truth be told, there are several factors that need to be considered to know if a project is on track or off track. As we look across our project, we ask ourselves a series of questions to help us make that call.
It’s essential to ensure that invoicing schedules and project timelines are in harmony. Evaluate if adjustments are needed to reflect the project’s progress. For example, if we have completed 25% of the project milestones, we should have expended about 25% of the budget. If that is not the case, we need to understand why that might be and if we need to take measures to get those items in alignment.
Similarly, we regularly review the progress of the team by looking at several variables. Are the budgeted hours enough to complete the remaining backlog, considering not just development hours, but QA effort, our project ceremonies, and final testing and launch effort? What are the complex items, and what assumptions did we log when estimating that effort to the actual implementation? Are those assumptions holding, or were any new things uncovered along the way that we need to re-review and confirm with the client, potentially updating our estimate?
We have long considered our estimates to be just that, estimates. The work we do is very complex, and to hit a guess dead on is rarely ever going to happen. So, while we do concern ourselves with things going over-estimate, we are not worried if it is within a few hours. We would also expect to see some things going under-estimate and balance out. If we see trends going one way or the other, we look to course correct as we go forward. Along those same lines, we review the sprint run rate. Is the team putting in a consistent effort from sprint to sprint (in other words, do we know what our velocity is)? As the project gets close to completion, is the time trending downward? Epics should be completed, User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is well underway, and we are focused on final optimization, which means we should not necessarily be full steam ahead if all prior work was done as expected.
Every sprint has a set of goals we need to accomplish, mostly around completing and delivering features. However, some goals are higher-level, like making final decisions on future scope or directions, or possibly completing User Acceptance Testing. Are we (our team and our client) succeeding in meeting our goals, or are we falling short? If we are falling short and cannot make up that effort, what timeline and cost changes need to be made?
Speaking of user acceptance testing, is our client able to test and provide feedback on the functionality delivered at the end of each sprint? This interaction is crucial for both project success and client satisfaction. When the client is testing as we deliver, the cycle of feedback is quick and efficient. We know if what we have delivered has met their expectations. Likewise, if something was missed, or we find a higher than normal rate of bugs or issues reported by the client, that may indicate a need for improved quality assurance processes. A lack of testing will create bottlenecks in team velocity down the road or a potentially problematic UAT experience where a larger team is identifying issues or gaps in requirements that create a start/stop situation while things get fixed that could have been identified much earlier in the project life cycle.
Maybe a less specific way to tell if our project is on track or not is to gauge everyone’s perception of the project completion percentage. We ask them, “Based on what you know and what you are aware of, how far along do you think we are on this project, and why?” Variations in estimates can be a valuable discussion point and may help us determine if a change is needed in how we are running the project.
Managing the health and profitability of web development projects is not a one-time effort but an ongoing journey of continuous review and improvement. By regularly employing the evaluation methods outlined in this article—focusing on financial alignment, meticulous execution, dynamic client interaction, and cohesive team feedback—you can navigate the complexities of web development with greater confidence and efficiency. Remember, the goal is not just to cross the finish line but to do so in a way that maximizes client satisfaction, team morale, and business success.

How to Copy Google Drive Files Using Apps Script
In today’s fast-paced digital world, automating repetitive tasks is key to enhancing productivity and efficiency. One common task many of us face is the need to create copies of a Google Drive file, such as a Google Sheet, and share them with specific users or teams. Whether you’re managing project templates, generating reports, or distributing resources, the manual process can be time-consuming. Fortunately, with Google Apps Script, a powerful scripting platform developed by Google, we can automate these tasks seamlessly. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the process of creating a Google Apps Script that copies a Google Drive file, sets specific permissions, and shares it with designated users or groups. We’ll cover everything from setting up your script project to deploying it as a web application that can be called from any web app, making your document management process a breeze.
Navigate to Apps Script and create a new project by clicking on “New Project.” This is your workspace where the magic of automating Google operations begins. Rename your project at the top of the page to give a basic description of its purpose. As a final step to prepare your workspace, delete the default myFunction() declaration so that you have a clean slate.
If you plan on setting specific permissions on your copied file, it is best to enable the “Drive API” service within your project. Enabling it allows your script to communicate with the Google Drive API and adds additional functionality and methods for automating file management in Google Drive. To enable the service, follow these simple steps:
Choose a Google Sheet (or any Google Drive file) as your template. For this tutorial, I will be using a Google Sheet. This file should be set up with any structure or data that you want as the starting point for all the copies that will be created. Note the file’s ID from its URL, which uniquely identifies it on Google Drive. If you aren’t sure how to get the ID, open the file. The ID is the value in the URL between the /d/ and /edit. Copy this value for the next step.
Now that our template file is ready, it’s time to create the main function for making a copy. I will be providing code snippets, but please reference the Apps Script documentation if you run into any issues or want to explore other methods and options for manipulating files.
This is self-explanatory, but we need to declare the function first. Give it a useful name, or use the name from this example. I am also passing in a parameter for projectName. Since we are making copies and placing them in the same folder, we want a way to name the new files differently. For my use case, I am using a project name for each file copy.
Define the IDs of your template file and the destination folder at the beginning of your function. The ID for the folder can be found similarly to the file ID. Open the folder in Google Drive and copy the value after /folders/. After defining the IDs, define the file and folder by referencing them via their IDs.
Name your file by setting a name variable. If you plan on using a parameter for a unique name, make sure you use it in this step. Use the template and parent folder references to make a copy of the template, placing it into the desired folder and renaming it dynamically.
If you need to set permissions on your file for specific email addresses, then add the general code structure below and update the emails array. In this example, I am setting edit permissions for the specified email addresses by setting their role to “writer.” I am also setting sendNotificationEmail to “false,” which prevents emails from being sent to users, letting them know that a new file has been shared with them. If you prefer having these emails sent, set the value to “true”.
If your file needs broader access, like domain-wide editing rights, this can be set with a single line of code. In this example, I am setting edit access for all domain users within my organization’s Google Workspace.
If you want your function to return a value, such as the URL of the newly copied file, reference the code below. The copied Google Sheet had some unnecessary text at the end of the URL, which I removed before returning the value.
Below your main copy function, we need to add a doPost function to expose the main function as a web app. Apps Script requires the function to be named this way so that the function is callable via HTTP POST requests. Remember to pass the projectName parameter (or whichever parameter you decide to use).
Before deploying your script, test it within Apps Script to ensure it functions as expected. At the top of the code editor, make sure your main copy function is selected in the function drop-down, and then click “Run.” If everything is set up correctly, the function should complete, and your template file will be copied. Remember to delete extra file copies as you test. Use the debugger or log statements to troubleshoot any issues you may run into.
Use an API client like Postman or Thunder Client to test your web app.
Test the API call and make sure the file is copied as you expect.
Now that we have a functioning web app, it can be integrated further into an application, script, or other program. For my use case, I integrated it into a Vue application using Axios. Here is a basic example of what that code looks like:
Throughout this tutorial, we’ve explored the powerful capabilities of Google Apps Script to automate the process of copying a Google Drive file, such as a Google Sheet, and configuring how it is shared. By breaking down the process into manageable steps, we’ve demonstrated how easily you can streamline your document management tasks. This automation not only saves valuable time but also minimizes the risk of human error, ensuring consistency and efficiency in how resources are distributed within your team or organization. As you’ve seen, Google Apps Script opens up an endless world of possibilities for automating workflows across Google’s many applications and services. I encourage you to experiment further with Apps Script, exploring its extensive documentation and community resources to discover new ways to automate your workflows and make your daily tasks more efficient. Happy scripting!

Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim
Note: when I’m referring to Vim in this blog post, I’m referring to Vim Motions, not Vim the editor. Vim Motions can be enabled in most integrated development environments (IDEs) and would allow you to gain the benefits of Vim Motions without having to change your IDE. Learning the motions alone is hard enough, so don’t try to learn a new editor simultaneously (unless, of course, you really want to).
Yup, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation…
It all started just a few months ago when I randomly came across an old recording of a live stream by @realGeorgeHotz where he was writing a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) program, and I couldn’t believe how quickly he was writing code and moving through his editor. At that point in time, I had no clue he was using Vim, but it made me realize that I’m pretty slow in comparison, and I’d love to be at that level of speed someday when writing code.
The exact timeline is a bit hazy, but it couldn’t have been more than a week later that I started getting videos by @ThePrimeagen recommended to me on YouTube, who also seemed to just effortlessly fly through his code and editor. At this point, I knew something was up and came to the realization that these guys knew something I didn’t. After just a few more days of casual viewing, I finally stumbled across a video where @ThePrimeagen started raving about Vim and how effortless and fast text editing becomes once you take the time to learn it.
That was the secret sauce I couldn’t put my finger on, and I was immediately torn. Do I learn Vim, or do I avoid it like the plague? I’ve previously had coworkers on both sides of the Vim discussion; those who used it and swore by it and those who thought there was no way doing everything via your keyboard could possibly compete with the speed and efficiency of using a mouse in an editor, myself included. I went back to the original SLAM video I had watched, and sure enough, George was absolutely using Vim. It was at this moment that I realized I only had one path forward; to buckle down and get ready for the journey of learning Vim.
As much as I wish I could say, “After an hour or so, you’ll be up to speed and cruising along at the same pace as with a mouse, and after a full day, you’ll be flying around your editor like @ThePrimeagen and @realGeorgeHotz,” that’s about as far from reality as you can get.
Learning Vim is a process, and that process takes weeks of dedicated time (or months of dabbling) just to get up to the same speed as with a mouse. It’s probably one of the steepest learning curves of anything I’ve ever learned, but the payoff of learning it is extremely valuable, in my opinion.
The main reason for the extremely slow process of learning Vim is down to the sheer amount of mental gymnastics you have to go through just to move the cursor where you want it, copy text, paste text, etc., and it takes an extremely long time for those common actions to feel remotely close to muscle memory. I’ve been on this learning journey for nearly four months as of writing this, and to this day, I’m still having to recite the actions I want to take in my head as I’m performing them.
“Alright, down four lines, (4j), yank the line (yy), up 16 lines (16k), select the current line (V), paste over it (p).”
I look forward to the day when all of that becomes second nature because that’s when I’ll really start to fly with Vim.
Another challenge of learning Vim (which also happens to draw some parallels to learning development) is the seemingly endless methods of accomplishing whatever it is you’re attempting to do.
Let’s say you want to change the parameters of the TryParse method in the example below with your cursor starting at the beginning of the line:
If you’re new to Vim and don’t know many of the advanced motions yet, your initial thought would probably be to repeatedly press ‘w’ until you’re at the start of the word ‘role’, enter visual mode with ‘v’, repeatedly press ‘e’ until you’re at the end of the word ‘roleId’, press ‘d’ to delete what’s currently selected, then press ‘i’ to enter insert mode and start typing the replacement.
If that sounds like a lot, that’s because it is… and that approach is guaranteed to be slower than just using your mouse to make the same selection, press backspace, and then start typing the replacement. But when you’re first starting out, that’s all you know, so that’s really your only option as you don’t yet know a better way to approach it. (which is totally okay! You need to learn the basics before you start learning the more advanced stuff. You must learn to crawl before you can walk.)
With my current knowledge of Vim, if I were trying to do the same, I would first press ‘f’, followed by ‘(‘, which would find the first ‘(‘ in the line. I’d then press ‘;’ to go to the next instance of that character, this time landing on the opening parenthesis of the TryParse method call. I’d then use ‘ci(‘ to “change inside the parentheses”. This removes the text within the parenthesis I’m currently on (or in between) and puts me into insert mode immediately.
That approach is much better and is just as fast, if not faster, than trying to do the same with clicking and dragging with my mouse. In this specific case, I could likely be even faster by finding the ‘,’ character as that’s faster than finding the first ‘(‘ and having to navigate to the next one. So, with that improved approach, the full combination of keys would end up being ‘f,ci(‘, which takes no time at all to execute.
The best advice I can give with regard to the difference in approaches above is to try not to get tripped up on finding the absolute optimal approach, especially when you’re first learning. Be okay with a non-optimal approach that takes more time because you have to learn the basics no matter what. As time goes on and you get more comfortable with Vim, you can start looking into alternative approaches to performing certain actions. I find myself constantly doing things a certain way, then all of a sudden coming to the realization that there’s a better way to do whatever it was I just did. I’ll quickly undo my edits (using the ‘u’ key) and try the alternative approach I just thought of. If it feels better, I make a mental note to try and use that approach in the future when trying to accomplish that same thing again or something similar to it.
If you’d like to know where I learned most of what I know up until now, I heavily leaned on this playlist on YouTube by @ThePrimeagen.
I know there’s been a few nuggets of information that point to some of the benefits of Vim in the section above, but I’d like to do a deeper dive into some of them and also share some additional benefits I haven’t covered yet.
This benefit has already been touched on above, but I still believe it’s worth calling out in this section since it is definitely the main benefit of learning Vim. Anything that can make you a faster developer should be a no-brainer. As previously mentioned, you will be much slower when you first start. This is the most painful part of learning Vim, but once you’re equally as fast with Vim as you are with a mouse, you will have crossed the threshold of gaining all the additional benefits outlined below with the additional upside of having the ability to continually get faster and faster as time goes on.
This may seem like a strange benefit, but switching between your keyboard and mouse less frequently can have a large impact on reducing your risk of developing an RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). Every time you have to move your hand from your keyboard to your mouse, you’re putting strain on your wrist, elbow, and shoulder. The more times in a day you’re performing this action, the higher your risk for RSI’s.
If you’re still using your existing IDE when learning Vim, it’s likely you’ll still be using your mouse to navigate within your IDE. But reducing the risk of RSI’s can be further enhanced by switching to a Vim-based editor (see “Adoption of ‘better’ IDE’s” below)
This might be a bit more of a niche benefit, but this was definitely a big one for me. As someone who works on a Windows machine at work and has a macOS machine at home for personal projects, I would constantly get tripped up on Ctrl vs. Command when copying/pasting and all the differences in cursor movement between the two operating systems (Ctrl + arrows in Windows are the same as Option + arrows in macOS when moving the cursor in text files).
All this mental overhead went away once I was using Vim on both machines. Need to copy text? Just use ‘y’. Need to paste? Just use ‘p’. Need to undo? Just use ‘u’. Need to move the cursor word by word? Just use ‘w’.
You could make the argument that I just traded the mental overhead of switching between systems for the overhead of using Vim, but the beauty of Vim is that once it’s learned, the mental overhead disappears. If I had stuck with my old approach, the mental overhead would still exist every time I switch systems until the end of time.
Another small but still impactful benefit that fits within the portability benefit is the ability to edit things like config files directly on servers that you’re accessing via SSH. With Vim, you can quickly navigate and edit files when working in a GUI-less environment.
This section is extremely subjective since the best IDE for you is always going to be the one you’re most comfortable using, but there’s no harm in stepping outside your comfort zone and seeing what else might be available to you.
If I had to guess, most developers reading this are using VS Code as it has more or less become the industry standard for web development due to its extensibility afforded by their extension ecosystem. I, too, still use VS Code when writing code on Windows machines, as the Vim extension does a great job of giving me 90% of what I’m looking for. The remaining 10% is down to limitations I’ve found when it comes to navigating the IDE itself (I’m sure it’s possible to fix most, if not all, of the limitations I’ve experienced, but I haven’t taken the time to figure out how yet).
If you’re someone who loves tinkering and wants to really dive deep into making an IDE that’s tailored to your specific wants and desires, I’d recommend looking into NeoVim. I’d also recommend holding off until you’ve got the basics of Vim down before doing so. Otherwise, you’ll be trying to learn two things simultaneously, adding additional complexity.
I ended up making my own NeoVim configuration based on a handful of tutorials I watched on the topic, and I’ve found I much prefer working in my custom IDE than I do working in VS Code, but it could also be down to some additional tooling that I use that isn’t available on Windows. My current setup on my personal macOS machine consists of using my custom NeoVim editor in conjunction with tmux, which is a terminal multiplexer. This allows me to easily switch between multiple instances of NeoVim, all individually configured for the needs of each project. This makes it super easy to jump between projects and pick up wherever I had last left off and also allows each project to be set up exactly how I like it. I even have some tmux plugins set up to handle saving the state of my sessions so that after a system reboot, all my sessions are exactly how they were before the restart.
It’s also super easy to “package up” your configuration, so it’s super fast and easy to get spun up on a new machine. In my case, my tmux and NeoVim configuration files are in a repository on my GitHub, so whenever I set up a new machine, I just install NeoVim and tmux, clone my repo, create symlinks to the root of my user for the tmux and NeoVim configuration files and directories, and I’m good to go. Everything is set up exactly how I previously had it, and it took less than a few minutes. It also allows me to make updates on any of my machines, push those changes to my repo, and then pull those changes on any other machines. Because of the symlinks, those changes are applied to my system as soon as I perform a pull operation.
The biggest benefit of NeoVim and tmux, in my opinion, is that I’m able to navigate every aspect of my editor via my keyboard. This makes my development experience a dream, as all my coding can take place without ever needing to move my hands off my keyboard. It also makes it really enjoyable to work on just my laptop when I’m on the go, as I don’t need to constantly reach for the trackpad when navigating my IDE.
My hope is that this blog post has at least made you consider trying out Vim at some point, even if you’ve previously sworn off the idea of ever giving it a chance. I was in that position not too long ago, and I can tell you from experience that as long as you stick with it and give it a fair chance, you might be surprised at how beneficial it is to learn Vim. While the path to mastering Vim may seem daunting, the endless possibilities it offers in terms of speed, health benefits, and adaptability make it a skill worth acquiring. The worst that can happen is you find out you don’t like it!

The Complete Idiot’s Guide To Kentico Content Personalization
It’s 2002, I’m in the second semester of my freshman year of college, and I have a problem. I’m a vocal performance major, but a few months into the school year now, I’m starting to realize that my options with that degree were, shall we say, limited at best. So I have a choice in front of me; stick with trying to make a career out of singing and doing private lessons or switch my major.
If I wanted to stay in the music world and not make a hard left turn into something like physics or Spanish (both things I considered in high school), the option that sounded the best to me was becoming a composer/songwriter. Becoming a school teacher was not at all appealing, and other options were either too esoteric (ethnomusicology) or not something I was interested in (music production/engineering).
So, I decided to try my hand at writing music rather than just performing. I picked up a copy of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Songwriting and set to work, seeing if there was anything there before making the decision to change my major. I found the book super helpful with its basic introduction to concepts that I was vaguely familiar with but had never really put into practice myself. After working through a bunch of the content, I, ultimately ended up going into music education, which I did for a couple of years before bouncing around and, eventually, finding a home in the world of web development.
Someday, I might literally write the book on Online Marketing inside Kentico. For this post, however, let’s focus on the core principle of the “Idiot’s Guide” books, which is a basic introduction with no real assumptions on what you may or may not already know.
The term “Content Personalization” seems relatively self-explanatory, but in true “Idiot’s Guide” fashion, let’s start with the assumption that you’re digging into this concept for the first time.When you visit a website, there are basically three ways that site can determine what to show you.
Everyone who visits the site sees the same content all the time. These sites are often simple and meant to convey the same information to whoever decides to visit. That doesn’t mean the content never updates, just that there’s nothing extra going on behind the scenes to “decide” what content comes up when you visit the site. Some examples of sites with static content would be most blog sites or basic brochure sites telling users about your company / service / etc.
What a user sees when they visit a site with conditional content depends on external factors such as time of day or year, what sales or promotions are currently happening, or what events are being promoted. What content is displayed relies on those external factors, not what user is visiting the site. Some examples of sites with conditional content are a business site that displays whether or not the business is currently open or a weather site that shows the current conditions and forecasts.
What you see when you visit the site depends on who you are. You might see content targeted specifically for you based on your age, job title, industry, family status, purchase history, or any number of other factors. The site uses various methods of collecting information about you to try to show you content that is the most relevant to you. Some examples of sites with personalized content are most ecommerce sites or social media sites.
Alright, so we know what content personalization is, but why do it? There are some obvious benefits to personalizing content for your users.If you can show users products that are related to something they purchased in the past, they are much more likely to buy that item versus the user having to start from scratch every time they want something from you. You’re also exposing them to products they may not have even thought of or realized you carried.Personalizing content provides a better experience for your users. Nothing is more frustrating than reading a couple of great articles on a site and coming back later for more good content only to see a bunch of stuff that is not at all interesting to you. By showing users content based on what they have viewed previously, what industry they are in, etc., you are providing the most relevant content possible and increasing your user’s satisfaction and engagement with your site.By personalizing content, you incentivize users to provide you with more information that can then be used in other marketing efforts. Let’s say I, as a user, am told that I can get more personalized results on content, product recommendations, applicable sales / promotions, etc., if I give you some basic information about myself. Often, that takes the form of registering for an account. I’m much more willing to provide my information if I feel like I am getting something in return for that data. We’ve all bought something small or signed up for a newsletter after reading a good article, only to find out the emails you get afterward are not interesting or relevant to you. Taking some time to examine and segment your subscribers helps you provide content they are interested in, drives sales, and limits unsubscribes or, worse yet, the dreaded “spam” button.
“Okay! Fine! I get it. Content personalization is great, I’m not an idiot. But how do I do it?”First of all, you saw the title of this post, so don’t get cranky with me now. Second of all… I’m glad you asked!Kentico offers several ways to personalize your content for users. For this post, we’ll do a higher-level review of two of the options since each piece of the full puzzle really deserves its own post to do it justice.
Widget personalization is the most common and, arguably, the most useful version of personalization available to you and the one we will focus on primarily for this post. Your developers can enable widget personalization within the page builder feature of Kentico. Widget personalization allows you to do just that, personalize the content of a widget based on certain conditions. Those conditions can be whatever you need them to be so long as your developers can access that information about the person visiting your site (in Kentico, we call this visitor a “contact”). Two of the most common personalization conditions are by Persona or Contact Group.Once the feature is enabled by your developers and the conditions developed, you can access the options by clicking on the person icon on the top right corner of your widget.
Depending on the type of condition you are using, you may be able to select more than one option. In our example here, I can select a single Persona to display the content to or multiple contact groups. This allows me a lot of control over how I decide to personalize the content for my users.
You can see, for conditions with more than one option I can also name my variant.Once I’ve made my selection, and clicked “Add variant,” this creates a version of the widget that will only be displayed to contacts who meet the conditions I set.
Important note!
The Original variant of your widget will always exist and will be displayed to users who don’t meet any conditions. This means you can’t hide a widget altogether if a contact doesn’t meet any of the conditions you set on the variants.
If I want to make a change to what I selected, I can hover over the variant I want to change and choose to edit or delete it.
If you have more than one variant besides Original, you may run into a situation where a user meets the conditions for multiple variants. Kentico handles this by allowing you to order the variants however you like, with the Original variant always remaining at the bottom as a fallback. When a user visits your site, Kentico runs through the variants from top to bottom and displays the first one it encounters that have conditions that contact matches. You can reorder the options by clicking on the dot grid on the left of each variant and dragging it into the order you want.
The best part is, once you have all your different variants set up, you can copy and paste that widget wherever you want, and all your variants will come with it. Then, even if you want to completely change the content in each variant, you have them all set and ready to go.
Sometimes, you may have a need to customize a page to a higher degree than you are able to accomplish with widgets alone. Maybe you’ve learned through A/B testing that one group of your users likes to read through the content of a page before committing to filling out a conversion form, while another group prefers to get right to the form rather than scroll through the page. Maybe you want to apply a whole new theme to the page or make some other larger change based on who is looking at the page.
Your developers have full access to write conditions within the code that can make any number of changes based on the properties of the contact viewing the page. Those changes can be anything from the layout or color changes mentioned above to pulling in entirely different sets of data based on whatever you can work out between you and your developers.
You will want to think carefully about the degree and level of changes you make at this level. There is a balance between enhancing the user’s experience and creating confusion for both your editors and your users. Visiting a page one day, updating your industry on a form, and then going back to that same page only for it to look completely different can be a disorienting experience. Similarly, your editors will have to be extra careful when creating content to ensure it works across all versions of a page and have quick and reliable ways to test that content with each variation. The general rule of thumb is to keep changes as minimal and as meaningful as possible.
Whatever your needs are for content personalization, there is likely a solution within Kentico that will work for you. Just remember to take it one change at a time and measure the performance of each bit of personalization before you move on to the next. Also, make sure you don’t drive your content team crazy, generating 16 unique versions of each callout, CTA tile, and paragraph on every page.

Pair Programming Unplugged
In the world of software development, working together is the secret sauce that makes everything better. This way of teaming up isn’t just about getting the job done; give it a shot, and you’ll see it’s like having a brainstorming session and a code check all rolled into one. Every line of code you write together is a mini-lesson in making cool stuff and solving puzzles. Plus, it’s a great way to make sure what you’re building doesn’t just work but shines.
Paired programming is a fast track to learning and professional growth, benefiting junior developers by enhancing their confidence through hands-on experience and immediate feedback. This past spring, I tackled phase 1 of a massive project and felt overwhelmed daily. Only six months into my career, I was faced with new technologies and extensive CMS customization. The challenge seemed impossible, but thanks to paired programming, I saw exponential growth in my skill set and confidence.
Think about paired programming, like teaming up for a two-player video game. You and a buddy sit down, facing the same screen, tackling the same challenges, but with twice the brainpower. You’re joining forces, the experienced player shares hidden strategies and power-ups with the enthusiastic newcomer. This gaming journey reflects the core of paired programming. The senior developer, armed with their arsenal of skills, and the junior, equipped with new ideas, team up to combine experience and innovation. This partnership not only boosts the junior’s skills but also refreshes the senior’s tactics, leading to an innovative solution that could be the next breakthrough in the tech arena.
While on that big project, I found myself in a similar scenario. I was pairing up with multiple senior developers and peers. I was the newcomer, and they were the experienced players, sharing hidden strategies and power-ups. This dynamic transformed my understanding of software development. Several weeks into the project, I reached a turning point. I began taking on tasks independently, seeking assistance only when blocked. This was my level-up moment in the coding quest.
The immediate feedback and hands-on experience were like guardrails, ensuring I stayed on the right path while allowing me the freedom to explore and learn. This safety net was crucial in helping me gain confidence and significantly deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming.
This experience, akin to a gaming journey, reflects the core of paired programming. The partnership between the senior developer, armed with their arsenal of skills, and me, a junior developer with new ideas, boosted my skills and refreshed their tactics. Together, we combined experience and innovation, embodying the essence of paired programming where collaboration leads to breakthrough solutions.
Paired programming is more than just coding together—it’s about supercharging the entire software development process. This collaborative journey brings a multitude of benefits, from enhancing code quality to fostering a vibrant team spirit.
Pair programming transforms the daunting task of debugging into a collaborative puzzle-solving adventure. I recall when I was lost in the depths of an old codebase, far from the familiar terrain of my usual tech stack. Each file seemed a mirror image of the next, devoid of unique identifiers, and I was at a standstill, unable to pinpoint the source of a persistent bug.
Enter my pair programming partner, who introduced me to the Vue.js devtool extension for Google Chrome. This tool became the compass that guided us through the tangled code, allowing us to identify the precise Vue component in need of attention. With this newfound clarity, my confidence surged, and the process accelerated significantly.
This experience was a turning point, highlighting the power of pair programming not just in squashing bugs but in expanding my debugging toolkit. It underscored the importance of leveraging specific tools tailored to the task at hand, a lesson that has since encouraged me to explore and inquire about the array of tools available. Through this mutual learning journey, we not only ensure a more secure and efficient codebase but also foster a culture of continuous growth and curiosity among developers.
Pair programming isn’t just about writing code—it’s about scrutinizing and refining every line in real-time. I remember several times in the last year when this collaborative approach directly impacted the quality of our codebase. One time in particular, I was initially set on building a new feature from scratch, but I encountered small blockers along the way. Fortunately, my pair programming partner—a seasoned developer with a deep understanding of the codebase—suggested a different approach.
Instead of reinventing the wheel, we decided to refine and update the existing codebase to accommodate the new feature. This decision not only streamlined the development process but also resulted in a significant improvement in the overall code quality. Working side by side, I gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of the existing codebase, asking questions and receiving immediate answers that drastically enhanced my understanding.
This collaborative endeavor not only delivered the desired feature but also raised the standard of excellence within our team. By leveraging each other’s expertise and insights, we not only achieved our immediate goals but also set a precedent for continuous improvement and excellence in our coding practices.
Paired programming goes beyond writing code—it’s a masterclass in communication. I recently worked on a task where effective communication played a pivotal role in navigating a challenge. The task involved updating a feature for an existing project, but the acceptance criteria provided by the client was incomplete.
Fortunately, my pair programming partner, who had a longstanding relationship with the client, possessed a keen understanding of their communication style. Drawing from years of experience and a sharp memory of past meetings, he filled in the missing pieces of information, providing crucial context for the task at hand. Additionally, his deep understanding of the codebase guided me in the right direction, ensuring we stayed on track.
This experience underscored the importance of clear and open communication. It encouraged me to actively seek clarification and ask questions when uncertainty arose, fostering a culture of transparency and collaboration. By leveraging each other’s strengths and insights, we not only overcame challenges but also strengthened our bond as a team, paving the way for greater productivity and success.
The prospect of coding with someone might seem intimidating at first, but paired programming is designed to turn these challenges into opportunities for growth. Through structured rotation and fostering an environment of open communication, teams learn to navigate these hurdles, enhancing their cohesion and agility.
The rise of remote work hasn’t diminished the effectiveness of paired programming. Thanks to modern tools like Google Meet and Slack Huddle, teams can seamlessly collaborate regardless of physical distance. As someone who participates in remote pair programming sessions almost weekly, I’ve experienced firsthand how these tools facilitate effective collaboration.
Platforms like Google Meet and Slack Huddle provide essential features like screen sharing, allowing us to easily navigate through code files together. However, remote collaboration does come with its challenges. In an office setting, we might point at the screen to reference a specific line of code, but in a remote environment, we rely on line numbers and identifiers to communicate effectively. Despite these challenges, my pair programming partner and I have adapted our communication methods to overcome these hurdles. This shift in communication has streamlined our remote collaboration process, ensuring that we can work together effectively regardless of our physical location.
Pair programming is more than a method; it’s a journey of growth, fostering not only technical excellence but also personal development, effective communication, and a strong, collaborative team culture. By embracing its principles, addressing its challenges, and leveraging the right tools, software development teams unlock a higher potential. In the grand saga of coding, paired programming is that epic chapter where everyone levels up together, ready to take on the tech world’s challenges as a united front.

Composing Navigation and Site Structure in Kontent.ai using Web Spotlight
Navigating through the world of headless CMS can be complex, especially when content is entirely detached from the website’s implementation. Traditional concepts of visualizing and structuring navigation become abstract for content editors without a direct view of the site they are building. However, Kontent.ai’s Web Spotlight serves as a bridge between conventional and headless CMS approaches, offering a way to bring content and implementation closer together.
Web Spotlight provides a visual representation of your site, creating a more tactile experience for content editors. It facilitates easy webpage creation, content updates, and component rearrangement without the need for developers. It also offers device-specific previews to ensure your pages look great before they go live.
In an article by fellow Kontent.ai MVP Andy Thompson, various strategies for leveraging Web Spotlight in Kontent.ai are discussed. This blog post aims to consolidate some of those strategies, focusing on configuring Web Spotlight to model both the pages and navigation of your website.
One significant advantage of separating site structure and navigation is the freedom it provides in visually constructing menus. Using Web Spotlight, we can create both navigation and site structure, and these ideas can be extended for more intricate scenarios with additional content models. For instance, having separate models for header and footer navigation or channel-specific sitemaps.
The provided code snippets demonstrate the implementation using Next.js, but the concepts are applicable across different frameworks. One popular option is to utilize Web Spotlight to create a sitemap that mirrors the site’s hierarchical structure. This sitemap then becomes a powerful tool for routing and link retrieval. The code below includes a function that recursively traverses all subpages of a page, yielding paths to the leaves of the tree.
Additionally, there’s a mechanism for defining routes, retrieving paths for static generation, and obtaining specific page data in the getStaticProps function. For simplifying data fetching, the post introduces SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) in the context of fetching navigation data. SWR will initially return the “stale” data and also send a fetch request to retrieve the data normally. Then, once that request completes, you get the new data. This ensures that the navigation is always up-to-date and responsive to changes.
The following content models will need to be created:
First, we will retrieve our sitemap with all of its linked items. Next, we need to find all the possible paths of our sitemap. Finally, we can find all the unique subpaths and create a map with keys as the URL slug and values as the page. The MAXIMUM_DEPTH constant is used to limit how far traversal will go. Both the Delivery API request and traversal will be limited to this value. Doing so ensures that we do not leave ourselves open the opportunity of infinite recursion. In particular, this pops up when a Page content item is reused in the navigation, causing a nesting loop.
To define routes, we can retrieve all the paths and return them from getStaticPaths. Then, in getStaticProps we get the specific page data we need for static generation.
For links, we can simply find a matching ID to a linked page and return the path.
The navigation is as simple as querying the Delivery API for your data and rendering it as needed.
Web Spotlight by Kontent.ai simplifies the challenge of separating content and website design. It provides flexibility in creating visually appealing menus and site structures. The code examples, showcased with Next.js, illustrate the ease of mapping out site hierarchy for efficient routing. Web Spotlight is a valuable tool for modern web development, allowing developers to break free from traditional CMS constraints.

Exploring Vue 3’s Composition API and Performance Improvements
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration, making it a popular choice for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. As Vue.js moved from version 2 to version 3, several key enhancements and structural changes were introduced, changing the way developers approach front-end development.
One of the fundamental shifts lies in the architecture, where Vue 3 boasts improvements in performance, reactivity, and overall efficiency. Notably, the introduction of the Composition API gives developers a more modular and organized approach to building components, contrasting with Vue 2’s Options API. These changes, along with improvements in TypeScript support, faster rendering, and enhanced tree-shaking for smaller bundle sizes, collectively make Vue 3 a compelling choice for developers seeking a modern and optimized front-end development experience.
Vue 3 brings about significant architectural changes, taking a large shift from its predecessor, Vue 2. The underlying architecture enhancements in Vue 3 have been re-crafted to deliver improved performance, higher reactivity, and increased overall efficiency. With a streamlined reactivity system based on the Proxy object, Vue 3 ensures more precise and fine-grained tracking of state changes, resulting in faster and more responsive applications.
The revamped Virtual DOM in Vue 3 contributes to improved rendering performance, minimizing unnecessary updates and enhancing the efficiency of UI updates. Additionally, the modular design of Vue 3, powered by the Composition API, enables developers to organize and reuse code more efficiently, promoting a scalable and maintainable codebase. These architectural refinements not only elevate the development experience but also position Vue 3 as a framework that excels in delivering high-performance, reactive, and efficient web applications.
The Composition API in Vue 3 represents a paradigm shift in how developers structure and organize their components compared to the Options API in Vue 2. Unlike the Options API, which separates concerns into distinct sections like “data,” “computed,” and “methods,” the Composition API encourages a more composable and function-based approach. In Vue 2, data properties, computed properties, and methods are declared within an object, leading to potential verbosity and reduced modularity as the component grows. In contrast, the Composition API enables developers to use functions to create reusable logic and share stateful behavior across components more effectively. Let’s consider a simple example:
Vue 2 Options API:
Vue 3 Composition API:
In this example, the Composition API introduces the “ref” function for reactive state and the “computed” function for computed properties. This modular and function-centric approach simplifies code organization, promotes reusability, and enhances the overall maintainability of Vue components.The “<script setup>” syntax in Vue 3 further consolidates a component’s state, props, and methods. It aims to streamline component composition, reducing boilerplate and improving code readability. Here’s a quick example:
This concise syntax not only enhances the clarity of the code but also promotes a more ergonomic and efficient way of composing Vue components.
Vue 3 introduces several optimizations that significantly enhance rendering speed, facilitate tree-shaking, and result in smaller bundle sizes compared to Vue 2. The revamped Virtual DOM in Vue 3 is designed for improved rendering performance, reducing unnecessary updates and enhancing the efficiency of UI updates. This results in faster and more responsive applications, contributing to a smoother user experience. Moreover, Vue 3 incorporates enhanced tree-shaking capabilities, allowing for more efficient removal of unused code during the build process. This optimization translates to smaller bundle sizes, facilitating quicker loading times for web applications. The combination of these improvements positions Vue 3 as a powerful choice for developers seeking not only a more performant and reactive framework but also one that excels in minimizing the overall footprint of their applications.
Vue 3 also features enhanced TypeScript (TS) support, providing a more seamless integration with static typing. The improvements include better type inference for reactive properties, improved autocompletion, and overall stronger tooling support. This makes Vue 3 an ideal choice for developers who prefer TypeScript, ensuring a more robust development experience and improved code quality.
Migrating from Vue 2 to Vue 3 can be approached through strategies like “one-step migration,” where the entire codebase is upgraded to Vue 3 at once—for smaller projects; or “incremental adoption,” where developers can choose to migrate specific components or modules to Vue 3 while keeping the rest of the application in Vue 2—for larger projects. Vue’s official migration guide offers detailed steps and tools to facilitate a smooth transition based on project requirements.
In conclusion, the evolution from Vue 2 to Vue 3 brings forth a series of substantial improvements, ranging from architectural enhancements and the introduction of the Composition API to optimizations in rendering speed and reduced bundle sizes. Vue 3’s improved TypeScript support further elevates its developer-friendly features.
As developers explore migration strategies tailored to their project needs, such as one-step migration or incremental adoption, Vue’s commitment to facilitating a smooth transition ensures that the community can readily embrace the benefits of Vue 3 while building upon the success of Vue 2. This forward-looking framework not only addresses the challenges of modern web development but also empowers developers to create more performant, scalable, and maintainable applications.

Choosing the Right Software Tools: How Much JavaScript Do We Really Need?
Selecting the right software tools, languages, and frameworks is crucial for any software development project, especially when you are on a tight budget. In this blog post, we’ll look into JavaScript specifically, which will be required to some degree with any website project. We’ll explore when to choose between vanilla JavaScript, using Custom Web Elements, and JavaScript frameworks for web development.
Vanilla JavaScript refers to plain JavaScript without the use of any libraries or frameworks. At the time of writing, there is even a joke website for it here. Using Vanilla JavaScript is a great choice for/when:
The last few projects I have worked on personally at BizStream have had more focus on back-end functionality, which we have built as a team with C#. Also, there has not been much complexity needed on the front-end, so we decided to forego a JavaScript framework and improve our vanilla chops instead. For these simpler sites, it has been a good decision.
Custom Web Elements (also known as Web Components) are a part of modern web development that allows you to create your own reusable HTML elements with encapsulated functionality and styling. They are an excellent choice when:
I am a big fan of Custom Elements. One of their greatest features is that they can be used in all evergreen browsers, and you can use vanilla JavaScript to build them. In the same projects I mentioned above, there were cases where vanilla JavaScript was more cumbersome and complex to write. In these cases, we wrote Custom Web Elements with vanilla JavaScript to help us write simpler and more maintainable code. These complex cases included features like Paging for search results, custom tab controls, and carousels.
Recently, the term “HTML Web Components” has been changing to refer to Custom Elements without utilizing the Shadow DOM. This is the way we have been using them at BizStream. This method also works extremely well when implementing custom Kentico Sections and Widgets that require JavaScript to function. There is a great article with other references about this emerging trend here.
JavaScript frameworks provide pre-built structures and libraries to simplify web development. They shine in the following situations:
There have been several projects here at BizStream where we have chosen to use a JavaScript framework. All of these cases involved highly complex interactions, usually spanning across multiple pages containing complex state management.
One more thing to mention are Meta-frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby.js, SvelteKit, and Nuxt.js. They provide an additional layer of abstraction and simplification in web development. These frameworks offer the following benefits:
Meta-frameworks can be a great choice when working with Kontent.ai or any headless CMS since they are not tied to a specific programming language or website architecture. So far at BizStream, we have used Kontent.ai with Gatsby.js and, more recently, Next.js.
There are other things to consider when choosing how to implement the front-end architecture of a website. If the site is eventually going to be maintained by the client, their environment has a heavy reliance on Microsoft IIS, and they mostly have C# developers, then building the site with ASP.NET should be considered before writing the site entirely in one of the meta-frameworks mentioned above. But, if they know JavaScript and/or Node development well, then writing with mostly JavaScript is probably the best.Another thing to think about is the project budget and the learning curve of using a larger framework or meta-framework. If no one has experience with Next.js and the budget is tight, it might pose too high of a risk to implement the site with it. On the other hand, if the budget allows the investment, frameworks, and meta-frameworks can be a joy to learn and work in.
At the end of the day, choosing the right software tools, languages, and approaches depends on the specific requirements of your web development project. JavaScript offers a wide range of possibilities, from simple, lightweight solutions with vanilla JavaScript and Web Components to complex, feature-rich applications with the help of JavaScript frameworks and meta-frameworks. You might not always want to reach for a framework or meta-framework when starting a new project, but they should not be disregarded either. To make the best decision, really learn what the options are, carefully consider the project’s scale, complexity, and goals, and choose the approach that aligns with the development needs.

Unleashing Digital Creativity: How Headless CMSs Revolutionize App Development
Welcome to the digital playground where rules are bent, creativity bursts through the seams, and the traditional gets a futuristic twist! Imagine a world where your content isn’t just stuck in one place but can jet-set to any device or platform you fancy. That’s the magic of headless CMSs—the behind-the-scenes heroes turbocharging app development.
In this blog post, we’re diving into the universe of headless CMSs like Strapi, Payload, Kontent.ai, and Storyblok to uncover how they’re changing the game, making content management a breeze, and why developers are geeking out over them. Whether you’re a code whiz or a digital newbie, get ready to see why cutting the “head” off your CMS could be the best move for your app’s future.
A headless CMS is a back-end-only content management system that provides a content API, which can be used to deliver content to any front-end system, application, or device. Unlike traditional CMSs, it separates the content from the presentation layer, making the content accessible and usable across different technology stacks.
One of the primary benefits of using a headless CMS is its flexibility. The decoupled architecture allows developers to work with any front-end technology, fostering creativity and innovation in design and user experience.
Strapi’s open-source nature means it’s entirely flexible for customization to suit any project’s needs. Since it is self-hosted, developers have full control over the hosting environment and can leverage any front-end framework or static site generator of their choice. Strapi also provides a feature-rich plugin ecosystem that can extend the CMS’s capabilities.
Payload offers an impressive level of flexibility, particularly with its local development experience, and is highly extensible. It provides an auto-generated GraphQL or REST API that can be modified as needed, catering to complex project requirements.

Headless CMSs offer extensive customization, enabling developers to tailor the content API to meet specific project needs, like adding custom fields or creating custom endpoints.
Strapi shines in customization with its easy-to-use admin panel that can be extended and customized as needed.
Developers can define their own content structures and workflows without limitations.
Payload is highly praised for its customizable Admin UI, which can be completely rebranded and adjusted to fit the look and feel of your business.
Custom access control at the field level allows for fine-tuned permissions settings, which is especially beneficial for larger teams with complex hierarchies.
Kontent.ai offers a range of customization options with its modular content models and components, which can be easily reused and rearranged.
It provides robust APIs for content delivery, management, and even AI/ML capabilities, which can be customized to a great extent.
Storyblok allows customization of content blocks, enabling a truly flexible layout system for content creators and developers. It offers a visual editor that is highly customizable, appealing to both developers and marketers.
The decoupled architecture makes scaling your application straightforward, ensuring your back-end remains unaffected as you add new applications or devices to your ecosystem.
As a self-hosted solution, Strapi allows businesses to scale their infrastructure according to their needs without worrying about vendor lock-in.
The API-driven nature of Strapi means that it can handle large amounts of traffic and content without a significant impact on performance.
Payload is built with scalability in mind, allowing developers to scale the application horizontally with ease.
Its minimalistic and optimized core provides a good base for high-performance requirements, which is crucial when scaling.
Kontent.ai, being a managed service, handles much of the scalability concerns automatically, providing seamless scaling without significant manual intervention.
Its global CDN ensures fast content delivery across different geographies, crucial for international scalability.
Storyblok’s SaaS model ensures that scalability is handled by the vendor, offering immediate scaling without the need for intervention.
The platform’s CDN and caching strategies are designed to serve content efficiently across the globe.
Headless CMSs are robust in terms of security as the content API is the sole point of content access, making it easier to manage and control access, thus significantly reducing the risk of data breaches.
Strapi allows for detailed role-based access control, which can enhance security by tightly defining who can do what within the CMS.
Being self-hosted, it provides the freedom to implement custom security measures tailored to specific requirements.
Payload provides built-in authentication and access control features, allowing for granular security measures.
It emphasizes security in its documentation, encouraging best practices for securing API endpoints.
Being a cloud-based CMS, Kontent.ai offers enterprise-grade security, including regular updates and patches without manual intervention.
It adheres to strict security standards and certifications, providing reassurance in terms of data protection and compliance.
Storyblok includes features like OAuth2, making it secure for transactions between the CMS and other services.
It follows best practices for security and provides regular updates automatically as a cloud-based service.
Headless CMSs like Strapi, Payload, Kontent.ai, and Storyblok are a game-changer for app development. They’re flexible, they let you tweak things to your heart’s content, and they grow with you.
It boils down to this: your choice in a CMS is a biggie. It shapes how you handle content today and down the line. Each option has its own flavor, so pick the one that matches your team’s taste and your project’s spirit.
In the fast-paced digital space, being able to move fast and break things (in a good way) is crucial. Headless CMSs have got your back, keeping your content game strong and ready for whatever the tech world throws your way next. Choose wisely, and you’ll set yourself up for a smooth ride in the digital fast lane.

Integrating Branding into UX/UI: Crafting Cohesive Digital Experiences
A brand serves as a company’s fingerprint in the marketplace, setting it apart from competitors through a blend of differentiation, uniqueness, and identity. It encompasses various elements, including a company’s name, logo, design, tone of voice, and essentially any feature that identifies the company to its consumers amidst a sea of alternatives. A strong brand is often steeped in a consistency that fosters recognition and trust, contributing substantially to a company’s valuation and consumer allegiance.
Concurrently, User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) are pivotal facets in the digital realm that significantly influence a user’s interaction with digital platforms, like websites and applications. UX refers to the overall feel and satisfaction a user derives from using a product, while UI is about the layout and visual elements that guide the user through the product. Their importance cannot be overstated as they can profoundly affect consumer satisfaction, brand perception, and, consequently, the company’s bottom line.Transitioning to the interplay between branding and UX/UI, a synergistic blend of these components can lead to an emotional connection between a consumer and a company’s brand. The aesthetics and interactiveness of UX/UI, when harmoniously integrated with the brand’s essence, create a digital atmosphere that resonates with the consumer on a profound level. This harmonization not only elevates user engagement but infuses a sense of brand loyalty that can significantly augment the retention rate. As the digital sphere continues to be a primary point of interaction between companies and consumers, the fusion of branding with UX/UI is not a mere enhancement but an imperative strategy for companies aiming to thrive in the modern marketplace.
Central to the seamless integration of branding with UX/UI is an unwavering commitment to consistency, which forms the bedrock of a memorable digital identity. Each design facet, from the carefully chosen color palettes to the distinctive typography and the intuitive layout, should serve a dual purpose—ensuring functionality while resonating with the brand’s core identity. Take, for instance, a brand embodying the themes of “youth” and “vibrancy”; the strategic choice of bright, contrasting colors, dynamic layouts, and bold typefaces is imperative. These elements, when harmoniously intertwined, serve as a continuous reinforcement of the brand ethos as users navigate through the digital platform. For example, the Google Store website showcases design consistency through its intuitive layout, harmonizing colors and fonts, and seamless navigation, making the shopping experience both pleasant and user-friendly.
Moreover, such a meticulous design approach transcends mere aesthetics; it creates a resonant narrative that underscores the brand’s identity, making every user interaction a brand-affirming experience. This strategic alignment between branding and UX/UI not only enriches the user experience but also morphs the digital platform into a potent conduit for brand communication. Ultimately, this consistency in design, reflecting the brand’s core values, fosters a trustworthy and engaging platform that resonates with the target audience.
Creating an emotional connection through UX/UI design is a profound tactic to foster brand perception and engagement, aiming to transcend a mere transactional user relationship. Utilizing design elements like colors and shapes can evoke a spectrum of emotions; for instance, a tranquil blue, often used in finance apps like PayPal, evokes trust and calmness, while an exciting red may stir urgency, often used in sales promotions. Beyond color, storytelling within design also forms a compelling pathway to engage emotions. Airbnb, for instance, masterfully employs storytelling in its UX/UI design, crafting a narrative through visuals and user journeys that echo the experiences and stories of hosts and travelers, making the platform more relatable and inspiring. Adobe’s website skillfully creates an emotional connection, using vibrant imagery and interactive elements that evoke a sense of creativity and inspiration in its users.
Incorporating human-centric imagery and micro-interactions further humanizes the user experience, adding a layer of empathy and engagement. Platforms like Slack create a playful, human-like environment with friendly illustrations and conversational micro-interactions, softening the formal corporate communication landscape. On a similar note, providing emotional feedback mechanisms, like Facebook’s ‘Reactions’ feature, enables a personalized user interaction, allowing users to express emotions and engage on a deeper level. Through these nuanced design strategies, brands can foster a rich emotional connection, making the user experience more engaging, memorable, and aligned with the brand’s core values and personality.
Typography, which some mistakenly deem as a mere afterthought, actually wields significant power in translating a brand’s essence. The subtleties in font choices can capture the intricacies of brand identity. Whether it’s the refined elegance of a serif font chosen for a high-end luxury brand or the sleek simplicity of a sans-serif that resonates with a cutting-edge tech startup, the language of fonts speaks volumes. By thoughtfully and consistently applying specific fonts across all digital interfaces and marketing materials, businesses can underscore their brand’s personality and promises.
Figma’s website effectively utilizes typography in its UX/UI design, employing clean, readable fonts that not only enhance the aesthetic appeal but also improve the overall user experience by facilitating easy navigation and readability.
Microinteractions present another rich opportunity for embedding brand identity into UX/UI. These are the small, nuanced animations or design reactions that respond to user activity. The beauty of microinteractions lies in their ability to surprise and delight. A whimsical loading animation crafted in the brand’s theme or cleverly written, brand-consistent error messages that bring out a brand’s quirky personality not only enhance functionality but also turn routine interactions into memorable moments.
The Apple website enhances its UX/UI design with subtle yet impactful microinteractions, like animated buttons and responsive menus, that not only delight users but also provide intuitive feedback for a more engaging browsing experience.
Navigating the diverse world of mobile UX/UI further adds layers of complexity to this branding challenge. With the myriad of screen sizes, resolutions, and operating systems, maintaining brand consistency can sometimes feel like navigating a maze. However, with advanced responsive design techniques and a laser-focused commitment to preserving brand aesthetics and feel across platforms, businesses can rise to this challenge, ensuring their brand feels at home regardless of the device.
PayPal’s mobile experience excels in UX/UI design by seamlessly incorporating its distinctive brand elements into a streamlined, user-friendly interface, which not only simplifies transactions but also reinforces brand identity, ensuring a secure and visually cohesive experience for its users.
The modern digital era is reshaping how branding is perceived and executed, blending traditional branding channels with digital platforms, thereby presenting businesses with a more intricate challenge. This evolving scenario underlines the crucial role of professional designers, who hold the key to successfully navigating this complex realm. With their rich experience, keen aesthetic eye, and deep understanding of user behavior across digital platforms, professional designers are adept at meticulously integrating branding into UX/UI design to significantly elevate user engagement and satisfaction. Their expertise ensures a seamless melding of brand identity with user-centric design, creating a coherent and engaging user experience. Furthermore, their adeptness in utilizing advanced design tools and staying updated with evolving design trends is invaluable. By fostering a well-crafted digital presence, professional designers help cultivate a form of brand loyalty that transcends beyond mere pixels, embedding the brand deeply into the hearts and minds of consumers. This not only creates a lasting impression but fosters a community of loyal customers, significantly bolstering the brand’s market positioning and recall value. It is instrumental to weave the brand’s essence intricately through the digital user experience, bridging the gap between functional expectations and profound brand loyalty.

Beyond Business: BizStream’s 2023 Community Outreach Efforts
Care is at the heart of BizStream’s seven core values, guiding our passion for caring for our clients, projects, team members, and our community. While our commitment to community support is ongoing, we get the whole team together each quarter to make a larger contribution toward meaningful change. In this blog post, we’ll explore each quarterly outreach event, highlighting BizStream’s collective efforts to create a lasting, positive impact on our community.
For our first quarter community outreach event, BizStream purchased snack items to provide 1,000 snack packs for Hand2Hand. On March 24th, our team dedicated the afternoon to assembling and delivering these snack packs to the Hand2Hand distribution center in Jenison, MI.Hand2Hand partners with local churches, businesses, individuals, and schools to provide backpacks filled with food for kids facing weekend hunger. Food sent home consists of breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner items.
To celebrate Earth Day, BizStream hosted its annual community-wide electronics recycling drive on April 21st. We invited everyone to drop off their unwanted electronic items for safe and eco-friendly recycling. This year, we collected and safely disposed of 4,690 pounds of recyclables via Comprenew. Since 2014, BizStream has helped recycle a total of 42,209 pounds of unwanted electronics responsibly!
In our Q3 outreach initiative, we aimed to make a positive environmental impact in our community. Team members were divided into six groups, dedicating an hour to hit the streets and pick up trash near BizStream’s headquarters. On that hot and humid August afternoon, we happily collected over 20 bags of garbage, contributing to the beautification of our community.
Continuing our yearly tradition, in Q4, we partnered with a local school and Love INC of Northeast Ottawa to support families in creating a happy Christmas for their little ones through the Holiday Helpers program.
Each team member received funds to shop for the children based on their shoe size, clothing size, and “wish list” items. This year, the team brought holiday cheer to 25 children from 7 families, and over the past six years, we’ve had the privilege of brightening the holidays for over 155 children!
Beyond our quarterly outreach initiatives, we believe in supporting the community all year round. In 2023, BizStream was thrilled to lend a helping hand to the following fantastic organizations:
In 2023, we were thrilled to extend our helping hand to various fantastic organizations, knowing that the little gestures add up to create lasting, meaningful impacts. Plus, our team has a lot of fun doing it! We look forward to continuing our mission to make a difference in 2024 and beyond.

5 Reasons to Choose Brand Refinement Over a Complete Rebrand
In a busy and constantly changing market, brands are always trying to get the attention of customers. They are all competing in a big area. A brand’s identity is very important in this competition. It helps the brand stand out, connect with people, and make a good and lasting impression.
But when the market or the business changes, the brand’s identity might not fit anymore. That’s when a brand might think about rebranding, which is like starting over. Rebranding can include changing the brand’s name, logo, look, message, and sometimes even its business strategy. This is especially true for businesses that have gone through big changes like mergers or are targeting new customers.
However, not all brands need such a big change. There’s a more delicate option called brand refinement. This is about making small adjustments to the brand without changing its core identity. It keeps the brand up-to-date with small changes in business strategy or customer preferences, making sure the brand stays relevant and appealing.
Rebranding and brand refinement are two ends of a spectrum, each with its own set of advantages and implications. A full rebranding is like a new dawn, a fresh start from a clean slate, which could be indispensable for brands facing substantial changes in their market dynamics. However, it is a hefty investment not just in financial terms but also in time and resources.
On the flip side, brand refinement is akin to a skilled potter molding and shaping the clay, making minor yet impactful tweaks to the existing design. It’s about maintaining the brand’s core identity while fine-tuning certain aspects to ensure resonance with the evolving market dynamics and consumer preferences. It’s a more conservative, less disruptive, yet highly effective approach.
The decision between rebranding and brand refinement should stem from a well-rounded understanding of the brand’s current position, the market dynamics, and the long-term business objectives. Brand refinement could be the strategic middle ground that revitalizes the brand while ensuring continuity and resonance in the marketplace. It’s a testament to the adage, “Why fix what isn’t broken?” by choosing to refine and polish instead of overhauling entirely. This strategic middle ground could be the linchpin for fostering a brand’s growth, resonance, and longevity in a competitive market scenario.

Zero Trust: The Next Big Thing or Just the Latest Buzzword?
If there’s one thing the tech world has in abundance, it’s buzzwords. If our servers thrived on buzzwords, we’d be powering the entire global server ecosystem for centuries. Okay, maybe that’s a bit of a stretch, but you get the idea.
Enter the latest buzzword on the block: Zero Trust. Now, here’s the thing—Zero Trust means many things to many different people/vendors in the tech realm. Ask five vendors about their Zero Trust product, and you’re likely to get five different answers, a toolkit that resembles a tech wizard’s dream, and likely a price tag to fit that dream. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and dig into Zero Trust—at least, what it means to BizStream and what it could mean for you and your company.
At its core, Zero Trust is essentially saying, “Just because a device is on a ‘trusted network’—you know, your in-house corporate Wi-Fi with all those nifty monitoring systems and high-end firewalls—doesn’t automatically mean it should be there or that it’s safe.” This helps your security model by flipping the script to verify and then trust. I choose to think of it as a security framework. Once I have that, I can find the tool to match my needs.
When I dove into this Zero Trust rabbit hole and quickly realized that everyone had their own spin on it, I decided I needed to carve out what I was aiming for. Here’s the rough sketch I came up with:We need a better way to grant secure access to our legacy network and cloud resources from devices we may not own and networks we may not control.Man, that is like a mission statement or something. I kid, but this really helped as I talked to vendors to find the right tool/software.
So, after researching and talking with vendors, I came up with the following “question” to build my Zero Trust framework upon. Should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource? It might not sound revolutionary if you’ve been around tech for a while, but it helped me frame what I was looking for, more context around that control.
I may have gone a bit rogue with the implementation, though, not just logically separating my network traffic (VLANS) but physically separating them too. Picture this—when our team strolls into the office, the Wi-Fi network is just another network. It’s got zero connection or context to our core. We’re using a next-gen Zero Trust application that lets us answer that crucial question: should this user, on this device, in this given context, have access to this resource?
Now, armed with all this info, I can toss it into a risk matrix of sorts to decide whether to grant the request. This helps the company leadership, and me understand the risk we are introducing with our access. Maybe the data is highly sensitive, and I only want to grant that access with additional security measures in place, like forcing an MFA challenge. The added bonus is that the framework is now applied to all of my networks. We can layer on extra security to legacy networks that lack MFA or need additional security with very little effort. We can route traffic after security challenges have been met without complicated firewall rules.
So, there you have it—Zero Trust in action at BizStream. It’s not just a tech buzzword; it’s a framework that reshapes how we approach security. By adding layers of context and separating the physical and logical realms, we’re navigating the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity with a sharper focus.
In a world where technology evolves at warp speed, Zero Trust isn’t just a tool, a buzzword, or a framework; it’s a mindset shift. It’s about questioning assumptions and ensuring that access isn’t just a given but earned through a calculated evaluation. As we embrace the future of cybersecurity, buzzwords, and ever-changing threat models, one thing’s for sure—trust may be a rare commodity, but with the right approach, it’s the backbone of a secure digital frontier.
Want to talk about it more? Hit me up. Happy to share our journey and dive into the details more.

4 Lessons Project Managers Can Gain from Adventure Racing
In early September, my good friend (also named Josh) and I embarked on our inaugural Adventure Race in Northern Michigan. At BizStream, we champion the motto that “it’s good to do hard things,” so naturally, we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It did not disappoint!
The race encompassed a combination of trekking, canoeing, and mountain biking, demanding a fusion of strategic planning, stress management, and determination, all within the framework of light-hearted competition. The experience mirrored the dynamics of initiating a new project at BizStream in many ways. Reflecting on this day, I’ve distilled several key insights that have enriched my perspective and honed my skills as a Project Manager.
At the start of the race, participants are provided with a map pinpointing various checkpoints. In our case, the challenge involved navigating 18 checkpoints scattered across a 5-mile radius, all within a stringent 5-hour time limit. This is about the point when your heart starts beating a little faster, and the nerves start to kick in. What did I get myself into?When you spin up a new project, the same set of emotions can oftentimes run parallel. Nothing works more effectively at triggering a full-blown panic attack than a fresh backlog with 400 User Stories and an aggressive deadline.Stay calm. You got this.The initial step is meticulous planning, mapping out each phase of the project, similar to plotting a course from one checkpoint to the next. Opt for a path that harmonizes efficiency with productivity.It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Just as the human body is not designed for a 5-hour sprint, a team cannot operate at maximum capacity out of the gate to the end. Focus on completing the initial sprint effectively, refining the process as needed, and then advancing with the knowledge gained.
Throughout my career, I have read numerous books and blogs penned by “seasoned Project Managers.” Indeed, knowledge is a power in a way, but it’s equally important to trust your own intuition.During the race, we faced decisions on how to approach each segment (Trek, Canoe, Bike) and the order in which to tackle them. Initially, we contemplated starting with the trek, given its challenging checkpoints, which could potentially offer us a late-game advantage. This was what our gut was telling us. However, swayed by the majority, we opted to begin with biking, as it seemed to be the popular choice among other teams. We followed the herd.I learned that when all 36 teams are simultaneously bike-sprinting through the forest, it can lead to some pretty nasty bottlenecks. We ran into a lot of other people fighting for the same checkpoints. It may have looked like the path of least resistance, but it wasn’t necessarily what was best for our race strategy. This parallels project management, where choosing the easiest tasks or the most apparent route isn’t always the most effective strategy. Tackling significant features early on can efficiently address dependencies, making future sprints much easier.At one point in our race, we inadvertently started following another canoe. Little did we know that this particular canoe was a part of the 8-hour racing team (a completely different race), and they were headed toward a checkpoint that was not even on our map. This mistake, which cost us about 9 minutes as we struggled against the current to backtrack, underscored the importance of trusting our intuition rather than blindly following others. Trust your gut.
We had a considerable lead on the other teams as we entered the race’s final leg: the trek. We hit the trail at a sprint, victory within grasp. Our hope was that we would see the flag from the trail (it looked that way on the map, anyway). Unfortunately, that wasn’t the case. We didn’t pick a great starting point and neglected to get a proper bearing from our first position. Relying on hope rather than strategy, we missed the crucial first checkpoint and found ourselves retracing our steps back to the start. After losing 15 minutes, we made the decision to forgo that first checkpoint and return to it later. This choice was a testament to our ability to prioritize and manage time effectively, opting to cut our losses rather than persist in a fruitless search.This experience draws a parallel to project management, particularly in the initial stages. Establishing a strong foundation for your first project sprint is crucial. It’s essential to carefully consider which tasks to undertake first to set the stage for future success. The eagerness to dive into the work is understandable, but the pre-production phase, in my opinion, determines the project’s ultimate success. It lays the groundwork for everything that follows, so it’s imperative not to overlook this planning phase.
Raw skills will only get you so far. This goes for both you and your team. Relying solely on a team of top-tier senior developers, often regarded as ‘rock stars’ in the tech world, is a misconception that can actually complicate matters for a Project Manager.Both Josh and I workout pretty consistently (yay, CrossFit), and while our fitness level was certainly an asset, it occasionally proved to be a double-edged sword. We found ourselves over-relying on our physical strength and stamina, mistakenly believing it to be our ace in the hole. However, stamina is futile without direction, and even your greatest strengths can become liabilities if you lack a strategic plan.In a race that requires both speed and endurance and strategic, educated, and coordinated moves, brute force alone is insufficient. Adventure Racing, much like complex projects, demands a slower, more thoughtful approach. It’s crucial to utilize a blend of skills, not just technical prowess.This lesson is particularly pertinent in project management. Even the most seasoned developers can falter by overcomplicating or under-delivering solutions in the absence of a well-thought-out plan. Thus, it’s imperative to take the time to plan and rely on more than just technical skills to navigate a project successfully.
Did you count the total time wasted based on our mistakes? It was 24 minutes. The hard-to-swallow realization is the narrow margin by which we missed a podium finish; we were a mere 12 minutes shy of landing a top-three position. Any one of those mistakes could have been the difference between victory and our actual placement of 5th. I had a blast, don’t get me wrong. However, the thought lingers: with just a bit more experience, a deeper understanding of the race dynamics, and perhaps a more strategic approach, we could have secured a top-three placement.
So remember:
The advice from a seasoned 1st Assistant Director during my time in the film industry left a lasting impression: the importance of making a strong impression in the last week of work. This period is crucial as it tends to be what people remember and can significantly influence future opportunities. “Don’t screw up that last week,” he cautioned, “it determines if you land that next gig or not.”This concept resonates deeply in project management as well. Often, the successes achieved during a project’s initial and middle stages are overshadowed if the final phase is mishandled. A project that is 90% successful but falters during launch is often perceived as a failure. The final moments, particularly any missteps, tend to linger in the customers’ memories, overshadowing earlier achievements. This unfortunate emphasis on the endgame can sometimes lead to the team not fully appreciating or celebrating the project’s completion as they should.Recognizing and celebrating each victory along the way is essential. If a sprint is successful, it should be acknowledged and celebrated. Simple gestures like encouragement, praise, or team lunches can significantly impact morale. At BizStream, for instance, we use Officevibe to express gratitude and recognize the team’s hard work. While keeping an eye on the overall project goals, it’s also vital to appreciate and commend the team’s efforts in real time. This balanced approach ensures morale remains high and the team feels valued throughout the project lifecycle, not just at the end.

Beyond CustomModules: Naming Conventions for Clear, Maintainable Code
Programming is much more than creating instructions for a computer. Coding is where logic meets language, and as with any written language, there are principles that should be followed. Whether it’s a variable, a function, a class, or a module, the name you assign to it carries the weight of understanding for fellow developers and even for your future self. It has been said that programming is 20 percent coding and 80 percent figuring out what to name things. This seemingly simple act profoundly shapes the clarity, readability, and maintainability of our code. Proper naming can transform lines of code into eloquent expressions of logic and purpose. Each language has its own preferred naming paradigms chosen by the authors. For this post, I’m going to focus on C#.
The module name should clearly describe the functionality it provides. A developer should be able to understand what the module does without having to look into its code. And by all means, never call it a CustomModule.
Always use PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized) for module names. Consistency is essential for readability.
While brevity is important, avoid overly cryptic abbreviations that might confuse other developers. Use meaningful words that convey the module’s purpose.
Class names and object instances should generally be named using nouns or noun phrases that represent the entities they represent—for example, ‘Customer’, ‘Order’.
Try to keep the module name concise while being descriptive. Long module names can become unwieldy and more challenging to read. Aim for a balance between clarity and brevity.
Establish a naming convention for your project and stick to it. Consistency in naming modules, variables, and other elements across your codebase enhances readability and maintainability.
Choose module names that fit logically within the namespace hierarchy. This helps in organizing and structuring your codebase.
Ensure that module names are unique within the scope of your project to avoid naming conflicts. This becomes especially important when working on larger projects or collaborating with other developers. Oh, and don’t call your module CustomModule.
Choose between singular and plural form based on whether the class represents a single object or a collection of objects. For example, use ‘User’ for a class representing a single user and Users for a class representing multiple users.
Again, PascalCase is the preferred naming for properties. For example, ‘UserSettings’, ‘HasChildren’.
Local variables are typically named using camelCase, where the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words are capitalized. For example: ‘totalCount’, ‘customerName’.
Constants are often named using uppercase letters with underscores separating words. For example, ‘MAX_VALUE’, ‘DEFAULT_PATH’. Note: this is a heated debate among developers who argue that PascalCase is the way.
Choose descriptive and meaningful names so that someone reading your code can understand the purpose of the variable without needing to refer to additional documentation. Avoid using generic names like ‘temp’, ‘data’, or single-letter names like ‘x’.
While keeping names concise is important, abbreviations and acronyms can sometimes make code less understandable. Use abbreviations sparingly and only when they are well-known and widely recognized.
In some cases, it’s helpful to use prefixes or suffixes to indicate the purpose or type of a variable or method. For example: ‘isComplete’ , ‘hasData’.
Avoid using Hungarian notation (prefixing variable names with type indicators) as it’s no longer considered a best practice in modern C# development.
Consistency in naming is crucial. Use the same naming conventions throughout your codebase to maintain readability and reduce confusion. You can use whatever you want, but make sure it remains consistent.
Methods typically perform actions, so their names should reflect what they do. Use a verb or a verb phrase to describe the action followed by a noun representing the object acted upon. ‘GetDocuments()’
Always use PascalCase (first letter of each word capitalized) for module names.
Choose method names that clearly convey the purpose of the method. A developer should understand the method’s functionality just by looking at its name. For Example, ‘FetchDataFromDatabase()’, ‘CreateUserFromContact()’
While brevity is important, avoid using abbreviations or acronyms that are not widely known. Code should be understandable by anyone, not just the original developer.
Proper naming conventions cannot be overstated in the realm of programming. Remember, clear and meaningful names significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of your code. By adhering to these guidelines (remember they are just guidelines), you create a codebase that is not only functional but also understandable. A thoughtfully named variable, method, or module allows you to spend less time writing documentation and more time coding.

3 New CSS Features You Can Use In Production Right Now
How many times as a developer have you been excited about the announcement of a new CSS feature just to go to caniuse.com to find out that it isn’t supported by one of the major browsers? Well, don’t worry, this is not one of those blog posts. I am going to outline a few new CSS features that are either supported by the major browsers, are progressive enhancements, or have graceful fallbacks that are easily implemented. All that to say, you can use any of the features in a production environment safely!
This is one that I personally am very happy has been added to CSS. The nth-child syntax now provides a keyword “of”, which can be used like so: :nth-child(2 of .my-class). This will first find all the elements with .my-class and select the second occurrence of that class. As opposed to .my-class:nth-child(2), which would select an element with .my-class that is also the second child. As a developer of websites using content management systems, this can be very useful. One use case of this feature is when you need to target the second occurrence of a class that is on a widget/component. However, you don’t know where or how the content editor is going to nest this widget within other content. Now you can easily target the second occurrence of that class, with the nth-of syntax.
Text-wrap now has a new value available, balance. With text-wrap: balance, the browser will calculate the best way to wrap text in an element so that all the lines are “balanced”. In other words, each line of text will have similar lengths. Right now, text-wrap: balance only works with up to 4 lines of text, so it is best reserved for headings or content that you are confident won’t span more than 4 lines at any given viewport width. In addition, text-wrap: balance is not yet supported by Firefox or Safari, but this is a progressive enhancement. So if a user is on either of those browsers, it will just appear as if that property wasn’t used. The example below shows an example of text-wrap: balance in action. The first heading has text-wrap: balance applied, while the second one does not.
See the Pen 
text-wrap: balance by Tyler Stirtz (@Tyler-Stirtz)
on CodePen.
Container queries allow developers to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element’s container. This allows you to hide/show content or change the layout based on the size of a parent element. In order to use container queries, you must specify an element as a container using the container-type property. The container-type property has three possible values, size, inline-size, and normal. Refer to the MDN docs for an explanation of each value. Once a containment context has been created, you can use the @container at-rule to create a container query. Think of the container query just like media queries, but instead of basing the query on the viewport size, it’s based on the specified containment element’s size. The example below shows the text getting smaller as the container gets smaller.

Also, keep an eye out on web.dev, developer.chrome.com, and MDN for Baseline, the new initiative Google rolled out this year. The goal of Baseline is to easily show developers whether a feature is supported and safe to use in a production environment.

Decoding Proposals: Why the Highest Bid Might Be the Best for Your Project
Choosing the right design and development agency for your project is a significant decision. After all, when you choose an agency to design and build your project, you’re starting a long-term relationship that may last months or years. After carefully crafting your RFP and meeting with potential agencies, you finally receive proposals. One of them stands out, the one with the highest price tag out of all the proposals you received. When faced with a proposal that’s significantly higher than the rest, how do you proceed?
First, whatever you do, avoid deciding solely based on lower cost estimates without thoroughly examining the higher proposal. This due diligence could save you from challenging conversations about unexpected costs and shifting expectations in the future.
In our experience, disparities in cost estimation are often due to the following:
It’s essential to examine both lower and higher cost estimates and the context behind them. It’s crucial for your project’s success to understand the differences between the proposals fully.
In-depth conversations with both higher and lower-cost agencies will help to:
We suggest starting conversations with the agency that provided the higher proposed cost for the project. A thorough discussion with the agency will help you to understand the reasoning behind their project cost estimation. It’s crucial for your project’s success to fully understand why this quote stands out.
Before diving into discussions with potential agencies, it’s important to do your homework. Coming to the table with a clear understanding of your project’s needs and expectations not only demonstrates professionalism but also ensures that the conversation is productive from the get-go. Being prepared minimizes the back-and-forth, streamlines the decision-making process, and helps position yourself as a well-informed client.
Be transparent, genuine, and eager to learn. Clearly communicate your objective to establish a budget that ensures project success and a long-term relationship.
Expressing your concerns prior to the meeting will encourage the agency to critically review your project and come prepared to discuss your queries.
Provide the agency context on where their proposal differs significantly from the others.
Maintain a sincere, open dialogue and a willingness to learn. Engage actively and consider posing these questions:
Once you’ve gained valuable insights from the agency offering the higher proposal, it’s equally important to communicate these insights to the agencies that provided lower estimates. A discussion with these agencies can shed light on any differences in their understanding of the project, and it also gives them an opportunity to revise their quotes if necessary.
Your approach when meeting with lower-cost agencies should be as meticulous and inquisitive as with the higher-quoted one. Here are some essential questions to consider:
The process of selecting the right design and development agency goes beyond just the numbers on a proposal. It’s about understanding the depth, expertise, and value each agency brings to the table. While a higher bid might initially seem daunting, it may represent a more accurate, comprehensive, and ultimately successful approach to your project. On the other hand, lower bids may offer a price advantage but require a deeper dive to ensure there are no hidden pitfalls. Remember, the goal isn’t to find the cheapest or the most expensive agency but the one that aligns best with your project’s vision, scope, and long-term objectives. By fostering open communication, asking the right questions, and critically evaluating each proposal, you’ll be well-equipped to make an informed decision that sets your project up for success.

Making Kentico 12 to 13 Content Migrations Easier
In the ever-evolving landscape of digital experience platforms, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements is of utmost importance! In this blog post, we’ll navigate the transition process from Kentico 12 to Kentico 13, uncovering strategies, tools, and insights that will empower you to migrate content while upgrading your site. If you’re a developer, content administrator, solution architect, or business owner, get ready to unlock the secrets to making your Kentico 12 to 13 content migrations a breeze, ensuring your digital presence remains up-to-date with as little interference as possible.
Migrating content between different versions of a digital platform can be a complex undertaking, and Kentico 12 to 13 migrations are no exception. In this section, we’ll establish the ground rules that will serve as the foundation for your migration process.
Our migration journey encompasses various elements, ranging from custom tables and content tree items/pages to settings and resource strings. The goal is to ensure a complete transition of your content and configurations. However, it’s important to note that the content you wish to migrate must be accessible through the Kentico API. This criterion ensures that the migration process can interact with and extract the necessary data from the source Kentico 12 database.
While the migration process covers a wide spectrum of content types, it’s essential to acknowledge that content cannot be directly migrated into Kentico 13 widgets. Widgets, being a distinct and dynamic feature of Kentico 13, require a different integration approach. As such, our migration focus lies on other content elements within the platform.
To execute a successful migration, you must have access to both the source database of your Kentico 12 instance and the destination database of Kentico 13. These databases contain the relevant information that needs to be extracted and imported during the migration process. When running migrations in development, I recommend having backups and local copies of the source and destination databases. That way, if there is ever a need to restore either database to its pre-migratory state, it can be done simply using a SQL tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
A reliable tech stack is essential when embarking on the journey of migrating content from Kentico 12 to 13. Visual Studio 2022 stands as the cornerstone IDE of our tech stack. We use Visual Studio 2022 for its usefulness in managing NuGet packages, project secrets, debugging, unit testing, etc.
C# emerges as the programming language of choice for driving the migrations, establishing database connections, and mapping models from old to new.
Finally, the role of (SSMS) is crucial. This tool enables you to interact with the source and destination databases, executing queries, inspecting data, and managing database schema. SQL queries are the backbone of the export process in these migrations.
Throughout this guide, we’ll use specific terminology to distinguish between the stages of migration. The process of extracting information from the Kentico 12 “source” database will be referred to as the “export” process. Conversely, the process of inserting this information into the new Kentico 13 “destination” database will be referred to as the “import” process. Understanding these terms will help you navigate the migration steps with clarity and confidence.
In the following sections, we’ll delve deeper into the intricacies of each migration stage, providing insights and strategies to ensure a smooth transition from Kentico 12 to 13.
Before undertaking any coding efforts, it is beneficial to discuss with your team and/or clients about what content needs to be migrated from the old Kentico 12 site. Creating a full list of custom tables, settings, resource strings, page types, and other content will be essential to establishing a migration scope and strategy.
Now that you have a grasp on individual items that need to be migrated, you can get started with your first migration! Start by cloning the BizStream Migrations Repository from GitHub. We’ll be working directly with the source code there to create a comprehensive command-line script for your migratory needs. If you’re interested in a fast-tracked lesson, you can check out the feature/blog-post branch, which has the code updates outlined in the rest of this blog.
The example migration that we’ll be following today details the migration of “Article” pages from the K12 site to K13. The “CMS.Article” page type is built-in and has these content fields in Kentico 12:
A few things we’ll need to ask ourselves before heading over into the source code are:
1. Will our new page type have the same fields in the new site? If not, what will be the differences between those fields?
For the sake of simplicity, our example migration will have the same fields/field types in the new site’s “Article” page type. The only thing we will change is the page type name, to “MySite.Article”
2. Do we want ALL of the “CMS.Article” pages from the old site to be migrated? If not, how can we filter the articles down to only the ones that we want?
Let’s assume that there are hundreds, even thousands, of articles on the old site. Some of them date back to almost 10 years ago! Some clients may specify that they only want to bring over articles created in the last 3 years (2020 or later). This is important information to consider during the export process! For this sample case, we’ll be migrating all articles.
3. Where do we want all of the Articles to end up in the content tree on the new site?
Let’s assume that the articles in the old site are organized by year as follows:
We want articles to migrate to the new site in the same structure: organized under a “year” folder. Those “year” folders will be under a parent folder called “Articles.”
Now that we’ve squared away some important questions about the scope of our migration, let’s take a look at the new site. First things first, we’ll need to build out our “Article” page type here, with the same fields and field types as on the old site. Here’s how I’m naming mine:
As expressed before, we add the same fields to this page type as on the old page type:
Finally, make sure you choose “CMS.Folder” as an allowed parent type:
Now your page type is all set up and ready to go on your new site. Before we continue any further, though, make sure that you are able to add an article under a folder in the content tree. Additionally, go ahead and create the parent folder for all of our articles in the content tree:
Now we have completed the necessary steps to get our new Kentico instance prepared for the article migration. It’s time to dig into some code!
As stated earlier, you’ll first want to clone the BizStream Migrations Repository down to your local machine. Make sure this machine has sufficient access to the source and destination sites’ databases before continuing!
Inside the repository, you’ll find a Visual Studio solution file named Migrations.sln. Open that up to see the project’s files!
I’ll begin by recommending that you read/keep open the project’s README.md file, as I will be following its setup steps exactly as described, providing insight as we go along.
First, I rebuilt my Kentico 13 web app’s CMSApp.csproj project to make sure everything in my Kentico instance is up-to-date.
Second, we need to add our database connection strings. I created connectionStrings.config at the root of the repository and copy-pasted the skeleton code from the Readme:
I then replaced the connection string with that of my Kentico 13 (destination) database. If you’re wondering where to find this connection string, the easiest place would be to check your web application’s CMS/Web.config file.
Next, we need to add our source connection string. Once again, I followed the Readme and added a user secret to the project by copy-pasting the skeleton code and changing out the connection string:
Now that you’ve added database connection strings, we can dive deeper into the code base. Before we do, make sure the project successfully builds and when you run it, you see a terminal open that looks like this (You might have to hit “Enter” if there isn’t any text showing):
Let’s add a new migration option for our Articles. Remember to follow along with the Readme open.
First, we’ll add the generated code to our solution for the Article page type that we created in Kentico 13. Under Models/PageTypes, I simply created a Article.generated.cs and copy-pasted the page type code straight from Kentico into that file:
Note: If you already have generated Kentico models in another class library, just add that library as a reference to this project, and you can use the code from there!
To retrieve data from the Kentico 12 database, let’s create a SQL query. There are a few fields that are absolutely necessary to retrieve because we are using these fields to insert into the new database through the Kentico API. These fields are:
Given this information, we can craft a basic query:
We query against View_CMS_Tree_Joined because it contains all of those required TreeNode fields we identified above. This is all great, but we also need information specific to our Article page type! To get those columns, we just need to join on the Article table:
My results from this query are:
Aside from the obvious lazy replication of data for this test scenario, this looks like everything we need to continue with our migration!Note: For the sake of simplicity, I will be disregarding the content of the ArticleTeaserImage column for the rest of this example. There certainly are ways to successfully migrate images, but it requires extra migratory steps to download/upload images to and from both instances of Kentico.
Above is the generated model for importing data into Kentico 13. Our code will eventually map data from the old site to this final model before inserting a new node in the tree. However, we need a model for the data from the old site (hint: for this use case, since no field names change, they will basically be the same models!)Add a model class for the data we’ll be pulling in from the old site. The model looks simple:
As you can see, we’re inheriting from the TreeNodeModel class because that class has a few fields that are common between all page types (TreeNodes) and are necessary when inserting pages/nodes through the Kentico API. You may also be confused as to why we’ve omitted the “ArticleName” field. That is because we are using “ArticleName” as the page name source for the Article page type. This causes the database representation of Articles to store the value of “ArticleName” in a field called “NodeName” instead, which is common between all TreeNodes.The “NodeName” field is seen in “TreeNodeModel”, so we’re covered for that field.
Let’s now add a new repository file under /Repositories called ArticleRepository.cs. The repository files are used to define and abstract the retrieval and insertion of data from databases.
The important parts here are in the class inheritance signature. Our ArticleRepository is a SqlToTreeNodeRepository, meaning it retrieves data from a SQL query and converts that data to a TreeNode to be inserted into the Kentico content tree. Moreover, it is a SqlToTreeNodeRepository<ArticleModel, Article>, so it will convert the results of our SQL query into an ArticleModel (using a C# package called Dapper), map that model to an Article (using another C# package called AutoMapper), then insert that Article into the Kentico 13 content tree according to the “Insert” function defined in SqlToTreeNodeRepository. Check out the inheritance hierarchy and base methods to get a better understanding of what’s happening under the hood.Before moving on to the next step, make sure you paste in your SQL Query.
We’ll now define an AutoMapper mapping profile for mapping from our ArticleModel to an Article. To do so, we’ll add a new ArticleMappingProfile.cs under /Mappings:
Since our ArticleModel and Article page type have the same field names, AutoMapper can figure out which field maps to which between the two types, allowing us to have a very simple mapping declaration. For more information on how AutoMapper profiles work, check out their documentation.
Finally, we’ll add a ArticlesMigrator.cs class under /Migrators:
The [Migrator(MigrationOptions.Articles)] attribute registers this migrator into the terminal and tells the application to call this migrator’s Migrate() method if its corresponding option is selected in the terminal.
We’re done adding code for article migrations! Make sure your solution builds, run it, select Articles in the terminal, and hit “enter”! But wait… I’m getting this error:
The parent nodes for these articles can’t be found in the Kentico 13 content tree because they don’t exist! Remember, each article needs to be placed under a folder with the year the article was published, just like in the old site! Let’s take a quick look at the ParentNodeAliasPath field of our articles in our SQL query:
Two things: our new site’s main folder has a NodeAlias of “Articles,” not “TEST-Articles,” and none of the “year” folders exist under the new site’s “Articles” folder! We need to migrate those folders before we migrate our News Articles. The good thing is that we can add that migration to happen inside of our ArticleMigrator.cs. Let’s do that real quick, following the steps from the Readme again:
1. Add the Folder generated page type: it already exists
2. Create a SQL Query to grab folders from the old site, but format the alias paths to be accurate for the new site:
3. Add a FolderModel in /Models: it already exists!
4. Add a new repository for the specific folders we’re migrating. Note: There is an existing FolderRepository that we can inherit from to make our lives even easier:
5. Copy-Paste in the SQL Query from Step 2.
6. Add a mapping profile for Folders: it already exists!
7. Add a new MigrationOption: we don’t need to since we’re combining this migration under the Articles option!
8. Add a new Migrator: we don’t need to since we’re combining this migration with our existing ArticlesMigrator!
9. Add the new repository with constructor dependency injection to our ArticlesMigrator, and call its methods from Migrate():
That was the last step for folders! If I run the migration now, here’s what I see:
Sure enough, the content tree shows that the folders all migrated successfully:
But, we have just one final step: our original SQL Query for articles has incorrect NodeAliasPath and ParentNodeAliasPath values:
So let’s update our query to replace all instances of “TEST-Articles” with “Articles”:
Make sure to copy-paste this query into the ArticleRepository, then rebuild. Before running our migration again, let’s make sure to delete all of the “year” folders from the content tree so we don’t end up with duplicates.
Upon running the migration one final time, here are the results:
Our articles are all there!
As we conclude our exploration of Kentico migrations, it’s evident that the process is not just a straightforward transition but rather an intricate journey that demands patience and iterative development. Particularly for extensive use cases such as migrating product-related information like SKUs, the journey resembles a trial-and-error expedition where adaptability and persistence are key.
Migrating content requires an approach that goes beyond the technical stack. It’s about understanding the nuances of your data, understanding the capabilities of the Kentico API, and recognizing the unique challenges each migration can bring. The trial-and-error nature of the process means that unforeseen issues might arise, requiring adjustments, optimizations, and sometimes a complete overhaul of the initial strategy.
So, as you embark on your own Kentico migration adventure, remember that it’s not just about moving data from one place to another; it’s about adapting to the unexpected, refining your methods, and ultimately achieving a seamless transition that preserves the essence of your content while embracing the capabilities of the future. With patience and diligence, you’ll navigate through content migrations with ease and emerge with happy clients!

4 Time Management Strategies for Project Managers
Effective time management is a crucial skill that empowers project managers to navigate the complexities of web projects, whether that be through a discovery or implementation. By adopting proven time management strategies, project managers can optimize their productivity, meet deadlines, support their teams, and achieve successful outcomes. In this blog post, we will explore essential time management techniques that will elevate your project management game and pave the way for project success.
This may seem like a very obvious place to start, but experience has taught me how critical To-Do list management is to overall project health. Effective To-Do lists allow you to keep track of needed activity, prioritize your work, and ensure that the client and your project team have what they need to be informed and successful. I recommend focusing on high-impact, time-sensitive tasks first and using a tool that you will actually stick to for managing these tasks. A checklist on your desk can be great, but I like using a personal JIRA board for my task management. There are tons of tools out there that can be used, so look for a solution that fits you best!
Planning and resourcing a project is the de facto task that describes the average day’s work for a project manager. This can be difficult, however, when pulling together schedules that span multiple teams, companies, and time zones. While it may be easier to plan sprint rituals and meetings on a more ad hoc basis, taking the time to coordinate calendars, set clear expectations with all parties involved, and laying out scheduled plans with recurring meetings goes a long way in ensuring your overall sanity.
If making all those meetings and sessions happen across so many people is difficult, don’t be afraid to have tough conversations about prioritization and the importance of a regular cadence of meetings. If expectations need to shift, that’s okay too. Get everyone on the same page, though, and make sure the plan is agreed upon by all.
Strong and transparent communication is essential for project success. Regularly communicate with your team, stakeholders, and clients to ensure everyone is aligned. Share project updates, discuss challenges, and provide clear expectations. Effective communication fosters collaboration, prevents misunderstandings, and promotes a supportive team environment.
At BizStream, we believe there should never be surprises regarding project status and budget. Transparency expedites and invigorates decision-making. It builds trust. It allows decision-makers to do what they do best. Communicating as soon as possible, with clarity and decisiveness, can help secure ongoing project health.
Time-blocking is a powerful technique for optimizing focus and productivity. Allocate specific time blocks for different tasks, such as meetings, focused work, and communication. Protect these time blocks from interruptions and distractions. By dedicating uninterrupted chunks of time to important tasks, you’ll enhance your focus and efficiency.
By adopting these time management techniques, project managers will be better equipped to navigate through projects, meet deadlines, and deliver outstanding results. Remember, time management is a valuable asset that allows PMs to lead their teams with efficiency and achieve remarkable results in every project. Find what works for you, and as with all things project-related, don’t be afraid to change it up as you learn more.

How BizStream Elevates Developer Growth with Engineering Ladders
We have recently explored alternative methods to effectively evaluate and convey our developers’ skill sets while also establishing a clear path for their future advancement.
If you’ve been in the software development industry previously, you’ve probably seen the typical “competency matrix” for defining what a Junior, Mid-level, and Senior developer should look like at a given organization.
For example:
Source
While frameworks like these work, we had a handful of reasons for wanting to avoid this approach:
As you can see from the points above, we really wanted to find an approach that is much more granular than what is typically used, so that our developers can have a clearer growth path that’s more individualized to their current skill set and experience. Enter Engineering Ladders…
When we came across the engineering ladders repository and started looking into its approach, we instantly felt it was a much better way of visualizing and quantifying developers’ skills.
To give a quick overview, this framework uses radar charts to visually represent the different perspectives and expectations of a given position. These radar charts are made up of 5 axes that represent the main areas of interest when assessing developers. Those being:
Base Engineering Ladder Template
Example Engineering Ladder for an Individual
Within each axis are five different levels of performance, each including the previous ones. I won’t list them here, but they can be viewed in the “Levels” section of the repository here.
The framework also has defined levels for developers, ranging from D1 through D7, which can be seen here. Some forks of this repository have even taken the liberty of mapping these levels to match some common “Big Tech” titles:
We saw this framework as an excellent starting point and decided the core concepts would be a great foundation for us at BizStream.
Even though the engineering ladders approach was the route we wanted to take, there were a few key areas that we could address to make this framework fit BizStream even better, which are expanded upon below.
When we first assessed the engineering ladders approach, we felt like it covered most aspects of what we look for in developers but needed just a few minor tweaks to be tailored to how BizStream runs and operates.
BizStream’s Engineer Ladder Template
BizStream Junior
BizStream Mid
BizStream Senior
We decided to update the System axis to better match the type of work we do at BizStream, which mainly involved changing some of the verbiage of the levels to be more “project” focused and less “system” focused.
For the Process axis, we made a similar update to what we did with the System axis, in which we modified the verbiage to also encompass development standards. Although one could easily argue that development standards are a subset of processes, we felt it was beneficial to explicitly call them out so developers didn’t just think about standard processes like code reviews and branching strategies.
As an agency, one of the main activities our developers’ experience is interacting and interfacing with clients. Since this is such a large aspect of the developer role at BizStream, we felt it was necessary to create a new axis that allowed us to measure client involvement.
As we’ll discuss in the data collection section below, we wanted to make sure we had some real-world examples of what it might look like for a developer to be at a given level in each axis, so we went through and added some “true to BizStream” examples under each level within each axis. This was done to try and remove as much ambiguity as possible when reviewing the different levels in each axis.
As referenced above, the original framework has predefined developer levels (D1 through D7), depending on where a developer stands across all the different axes. Although we believe this to be better than the standard Junior, Mid-level, and Senior levels, we still didn’t like the idea of having explicit titles for our developers. One of the main reasons for this decision is down to the variability that will exist for each individual developer. We feel it’s much better to assess the area of a developer’s chart to determine overall aptitude rather than trying to shoehorn them into predefined levels.
One of the main benefits of this framework, combined with the changes we made to fit our specific needs, enabled us to easily gather all the data we needed by conducting a self/peer review process. This process involved every developer at BizStream filling out a form that allowed them to review themselves and decide which level within each axis they felt they were currently at. They would then fill out this form for every other developer on their team so we would have their assessment of all the other developers on their team. We also added an extra data point for each developer by allowing their manager to provide their input in the same way since their manager would likely have some additional insights that their peers might not.We then took all these data points and used the median values from all responses for an individual to determine where they stand within a given axis. We found this worked better than taking an average since it would give us an explicit value rather than a decimal value that needed to be rounded up or down, which we found caused results to be skewed up or down depending on what rounding approach we took.In addition to using the median to determine the outcome for a given axis, we also looked at the standard deviation of the responses to look for any inconsistencies in the review process. This helped us to better understand where additional examples or clarifications needed to be implemented so we could ensure our data was as accurate as possible (which isn’t the easiest when there’s lots of subjectivity involved). The standard deviation also helped us find places where additional discussions needed to occur. If we found instances where not many people were in agreement with where someone’s skills were, we would pull the necessary people together to get a better understanding of where they should be assessed to ensure that the data we have is as accurate as possible.
Once we had all the data we needed and verified that it was as accurate as possible, we had to find the best way to share this information with the developers at BizStream. To accomplish this, we decided to build individual reports for every developer that contained the following information:
Once all this information had been placed in a report, a meeting was scheduled to review the document with the developer. The finished report was also shared with the developer afterward for them to review and reference at any point in the future.
These reports are a great tool for developers and their managers to generate topics for discussion in one-on-ones and/or quarterlies. This gives developers and their managers the freedom to focus on whatever areas they believe matter the most.
Overall, this new approach to assessing developers is a step in the right direction. While this was only the first year that we’ve attempted this approach, it was well received by the team as a great way to quantify where they stand as a developer at BizStream. We also received some great feedback that we’re excited to implement the next time we run through this process. One of the most significant improvements is an addition to the reports outlining what steps must be taken in each axis to jump to the next level. This gives developers a clear path of actionable steps that can be taken to expand their areas of expertise and make a larger impact at BizStream.

The Impact of Inclusive Language on Tech’s Diversity Gap
Language holds immense power. Words are the way we understand the world around us. They’re the method we use to “translate” and “transmit” our thoughts and feelings to others. However, that power goes both ways—words can be used to influence our perception of the world (and others) by creating or reinforcing biases.
Inclusive language plays a pivotal role in fostering a diverse, equitable, and accessible environment. I’ll explore the unique importance of inclusive language in the technology industry by highlighting its impact on representation, reviewing some common industry terms that could be improved, and ways language can improve accessibility design.
But first, I want to explain why this is important to BizStream.
At the very top of our About page, you’ll see a single sentence: “It’s always about the people, whether it’s clients, employees and their families, or our communities.” It’s the first thing you see because it’s the most important thing to us. We have an entire page dedicated to our community involvement, and we’ve even been named an Inclusive Workplace by Best Companies Group and COLOR Magazine. We strive to make positive impacts within our organization, within our communities, and within the technology industry—and at the center of it all is making sure that people feel empowered.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) drives innovation, creates a better work environment, improves customer understanding, and enhances decision-making. By embracing DEI, organizations can tap into a variety of perspectives, attract top talent, and develop products that meet the diverse needs of their customers. But it’s more than just commercial success to us—we believe that a fair and inclusive workplace aligns with our principles of treating everyone with dignity and respect.
The technology industry has long struggled to create inclusive and equitable environments. Statistics reveal that women, people of color, and individuals from other marginalized communities are often underrepresented in tech roles and leadership positions.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, African American individuals accounted for 7.9% of the computer and mathematical occupations workforce in the United States, despite representing 14.9% of the population. Hispanic/Latino individuals represented 8.4% in those same occupations, while making up 16% of the population.
In that same study, women represented only about 26.5% of the computer and mathematical occupations workforce.
Inclusive language is a crucial step toward dismantling these barriers. By using language that embraces diversity and promotes inclusivity, we create a more welcoming industry that encourages participation and bridges the representation gap.
By actively identifying and replacing non-inclusive language with more inclusive alternatives, we can foster an environment that promotes equality, respect, and inclusivity within the technology industry. It is essential to be mindful of the impact our language choices can have and continuously strive for improvement.
Inclusive language also has a direct line to designing for accessibility. Using clear, concise, and inclusive terminology ensures that digital interfaces and content are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
Learn more about creating an inclusive web experience here.
Inclusive language is not just a buzzword; it requires an honest and dedicated approach to make a real impact. I’ve had colleagues in the past roll their eyes at “political correctness” and bemoan any effort of inclusive language. But the thing to keep in mind is that it’s not about checking a box, it’s about being open to the thoughts and feelings of the people around you. It’s about creating a dialogue of transparency, openness, and inclusion to ensure everyone is treated with dignity and respect.

Understanding the Role of a Business Analyst: Identifying the True Problem
When I started as a business analyst at BizStream, I was advised that my primary responsibility was to identify the problems while the developers would focus on finding the solutions. Although I acknowledged the developer’s crucial role in resolving issues, I found myself resisting this notion. After all, problem-solving was a skill I enjoyed and believed I excelled at. Wasn’t this a primary reason I was hired in the first place? Despite myself, this line of thinking led me to contemplate the nature of problems and how we go about identifying them.
It became apparent that one cannot arrive at the correct solution without fully comprehending the problem at hand. Attempting to fix a car without diagnosing the issue or prescribing medication without understanding the ailment would likely exacerbate the problem rather than improve it. Similarly, when building projects at BizStream, it is imperative to grasp the client’s challenges thoroughly to create effective solutions.
Albert Einstein once said, “If I had an hour to solve a problem, I would spend 55 minutes trying to understand the problem and 5 minutes solving it.” This raises a fundamental question: How do we differentiate the true problem from mere symptoms or predetermined solutions?
Here is a story I believe demonstrates this well:
One day, while walking through a forest, a young man came across a river. Thrashing about in the waves was a child, struggling to stay afloat. Immediately, the young man dove into the water and pulled the child to safety.
At first glance, the problem seems straightforward—the child needs to be rescued, and the immediate solution is to jump in and save them.
As soon as the child was on shore, the young man looked up and, to his horror, saw two more children floating down river. Jumping back into the water, he grabbed one, then the other, pulling them ashore. A second later, another came struggling down the river. Without having the time to understand what was happening, the man continued rescuing the children as they floated down the river.
Thankfully, at that moment, a woman was walking by and saw all the chaos happening in the river. Grabbing a long stick, she jumped out onto a rock situated in the river, and extended it to those she could reach as they floated by.
At this point, someone else is confronted with the same problem but offers another solution. Oftentimes we find a solution to a problem and immediately quit looking for other potential solutions that may work even better.
The more the pair rescued, the more children that seemed to come down the river. The woman, reaching multiple children at a time as they floated within reach, and the man all the children that were farther out. Even still, they were quickly becoming tired and overwhelmed.
Another woman heard the commotion and came running. Seeing all the children in the water and the many more exhausted on the shore, she turned and began running upstream. The man and woman who were still actively trying to save children yelled to her, “Where are you going? We need help!” As she was still running she yelled over her shoulder, “To find out who’s throwing all these children in the water and stop them!”
In this scenario, we uncover the underlying problem—why are children being thrown into the river in the first place? Initially, rescuing the drowning children may appear to be the problem, but it is, in fact, a symptom of a more profound issue. While treating symptoms is essential in emergencies, consistently treating symptoms as the primary problem leads to trouble.For instance, if a client has a major bug that needs to be fixed that is caused by an aging technology stack, the best approach isn’t to leave the bug while we figure out how to update the entire website. First, take care of the emergency, then take care of the underlying problem. However, we get into trouble when we continuously treat symptoms as If they were the underlying problem.
This takes us back to the original question: How do we know what the true problem is instead of a symptom of the problem? One question I like to ask that helps me identify the root issue is, “How would we ideally want such and such to function?”
Asking questions to the client that helps enlighten where we are headed is neither prompting a solution nor asking what the problem is. In fact, as said before, we cannot determine the solution before knowing the problem, and we cannot know the problem without knowing where we are trying to get to.
To take the above story as an example again, if you asked the first two who arrived on the scene what they would like to see happen or what is an ideal state considering the situation, having better recuse equipment or being a stronger swimmer would not really address the problem. It would address the immediate symptoms of the problem and may prove to be very helpful. However, they do not solve the problem. The answer is to not have children floating down the river.
Let me take an example from building a website. Let’s say a content admin has received frustrations from their website users that their homepage is too busy with links. The content admin comes to BizStream and requests we figure out a way for the homepage to be redesigned so that it looks less cluttered while still giving users the same amount of links to choose from so that users can still get to where they want to go.
In this situation, you may notice the client already has a solution in mind, that is, to redesign the homepage. But what is the problem? The users of the site feel that the homepage is too cluttered and the content admins feel the homepage needs all that information to support their many audiences.
Instead of asking for the problem, let’s ask the question, what do we ideally want to happen? In this case, I would argue that ideally, the user would land on the homepage and could immediately find what they are looking for without showing anything superfluous. This may seem at first impossible. After all, how can we know what the user wants to see on page load? But if we start with the end in mind, it can help us determine what the real problem is: Users aren’t able to quickly and conveniently get to where they want to go. This problem statement opens up many more potential solutions than “The homepage is too cluttered”.
Stating the problem more openly and based on an ideal ending, we can only now determine what a potential solution would look like. For example, we may suggest adding a more robust search with search ahead capabilities. Or, we might suggest personalization, an often underutilized feature of Kentico that tracks users’ preferences and places them as part of a group set by the content admins. Content could then be displayed based on a user’s history on the site. We could even simply allow users to set their own “favorited” links, allowing them to always quickly get to where they want and remove the rest.
By beginning with an ideal end in mind, it allows us to help uncover the root of the problem, rather than symptoms of a larger problem. And while symptoms do sometimes need to be dealt with, a holistic and effective solution can only be designed after the problem has correctly been identified. So even though solutioning is a technological challenge that often should be approached by the developers, it turns out that problem-finding needs quite a bit of solutioning itself.

From Office to Outdoors: BizStream’s Summer of Playing Hard
As soon as the Michigan summers roll in, our team seizes the opportunity to soak in what Pure Michigan has to offer. With the Great Lakes’ pristine beaches and breathtaking landscapes, we enthusiastically embrace the spirit of adventure, camaraderie, and playfulness at the core of our company culture.
Keep reading to uncover the best parts of our vibrant summer and how they embody our guiding core values: Whatever It Takes, Work Hard, Play Hard, We Are a Team, Be Fearless, Foster Growth in Others, Care, and Be Positive.
Our summer kicked off with a refreshing break from the digital world as we embarked on our annual Company Golf Outing. The sun-drenched greens provided the perfect backdrop for our team to unwind, connect, and showcase our playful competitiveness. Thankfully, this event wasn’t just about swinging clubs since most of us are less than great at golfing; it was about bonding, letting loose, and embracing our value of “Work Hard, Play Hard.”
In July, Team BizStream embarked on a backpacking and camping journey. Amidst the gorgeous landscapes of the Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness Area, we hiked out, set up camp, played in the water, and shared stories around the campfire. This adventure exemplified our commitment to “We Are a Team” and “Be Fearless,” pushing ourselves beyond limits and finding strength in teamwork and encouragement as we hiked the two-mile sandy trail with all our gear.
Every couple of years, we hold our Company Picnic at Michigan’s Adventure, a sprawling amusement and water park. This year, we indulged in a delicious fajita bar, bottomless drinks, and an unlimited ice cream bar with our families and then headed out to take on the rides.
Beyond embodying our “Work Hard, Play Hard” core value, our company picnics exemplify our dedication to “Care.” These gatherings provide a platform for us to extend our commitment to families, offering them a chance to unwind and enjoy each other’s company in a fun environment.
As the leaves change, we gear up for two more exciting events that continue to exemplify our culture and values. Geeky Little Holiday is laid back afternoon of festivities and celebration to kick off the winter holidays, complete with an ugly sweater contest. In December, we’ll celebrate Christmas with our elegant holiday party. This year, at The Bissell Tree House, an enchanting indoor event venue perched atop one of Grand Rapids’ highest points.
Crafted with intention, our events team designs these occasions to offer our team a chance to unwind while nurturing our core values. Whether going the extra mile on the golf course, overcoming challenges in the wild, or enjoying moments with friends, family, and team members at the amusement park, our embrace of these experiences embodies our core values.
After all, our founders built this company to push back on generic corporate culture, believing that life isn’t just about the relentless grind. Instead, we find purpose in doing great work while working and finding time to unwind, foster genuine connections, and truly acquaint ourselves with one another.

From Chaos to Control: How to Stay Productive in a Sea of Tasks and Deadlines
In my experience as a project manager in an agency setting, juggling multiple projects simultaneously, I realized long ago that relying solely on my memory was a recipe for forgetfulness and missed tasks. I developed a mantra to raise the bar for myself: “Anticipate what everyone needs, and help them get it before they have to ask for it.” I wanted to be proactive in my work, which required a change in my approach.
Essentially I learned the brain is not to be trusted…
Good organization and time management skills are the unsung heroes of a good project manager. There was a time when I thought I could keep it all in my head, but after a few instances of forgetting to do or communicate important things, I started the barrage of Post-it notes around my workspace with lists of things I didn’t have to remember. It wasn’t long before I knew that was not the long-term solution.
I’m showing my age now, but it was shortly after I found the Franklin Covey method. Yeah, I had the planner and the custom pages that included the daily task list, and it CHANGED MY LIFE. I started prioritizing based on identifying and focusing on the most important tasks and activities. I was categorizing them based on their urgency and importance using tools like the Eisenhower Matrix, which divides tasks into four quadrants: important and urgent, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and not urgent or important. By adopting this method, I gained clarity and focused on the most critical tasks while ensuring nothing important fell through the cracks.
Generally, it looks something like this:
Once I had my list, I would start converting and ordering based on overall priority:
Then, I would assign a number to those items for higher priority to lower:
This mindset for setting priorities has stuck with me, even though my Franklin Planner has been replaced with many a digital app since then, but I will get to those in a second. While I highly recommend the above approach, you can do several other things to stay on top of your task list. Check out #5 in the below list for some of my recommendations.
Productivity isn’t just about being a taskmaster; it’s about reclaiming control over your time and energy. Embrace the power of prioritization and make room for the things that truly matter, whether it’s building relationships, personal growth, or taking care of yourself. Remember, it’s not always about getting everything done; it’s about getting the right things done. So, go forth with a renewed sense of purpose, armed with your chosen productivity tools, and carve out a path to success that reflects your unique journey.

AI at the Writer’s Desk: What Works and What Doesn’t
We’ve all heard about AI taking our jobs and starting the robot uprising. In this instance, however, I purposefully let it do just that (well, at least the taking my blog-writing job part). Using AI to generate content still requires getting through a bit of a learning curve in getting your prompts written well so that the tool knows exactly what you want. That being said, however, the below post was written entirely by the free version of ChatGPT. The only editing I did to this was to clean up a bit of formatting! Ok, well, that and a couple of notes where it was less than accurate.
I will follow up in a future blog post with exactly the method I used to generate this content. For now, however, enjoy!
Picture this: a marketing department where content writes itself, customer sentiment is instantly analyzed, and emerging trends are spotted effortlessly. It sounds like a marketing dream, right? Well, thanks to the power of AI, this dream is becoming a reality. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how AI tools, such as ChatGPT, have transformed content creation, sentiment analysis, and trend spotting within marketing departments. Get ready to witness the magic unfold!
Writing compelling blog posts, engaging social media content, and persuasive email campaigns can be a time-consuming task. But fear not, as AI tools have stepped in to lighten the load. ChatGPT, ConversionAI, and Writesonic are some of the powerhouses in content creation.
ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI, acts as a virtual writing assistant, helping marketers generate ideas, fine-tune their writing, and even create entire pieces effortlessly. It’s like having a witty co-writer by your side, saving time and unleashing creativity.

(The link to ChatGPT it generated for itself, as you may have noticed, is a bad link. This is why AI still requires human supervision 🙂 you can use this link to actually Learn more about ChatGPT)
ConversionAI (formerly known as ContentBot) specializes in generating engaging and conversion-focused content. It leverages AI algorithms to create catchy headlines, compelling ad copies, and product descriptions that captivate audiences. With this tool in your arsenal, crafting captivating content becomes a breeze.
Explore ConversionAI
(You might notice the link to ConversionAI brings you to Jasper – another good example of proofreading your AI content just like you would from a human writer)
Writesonic is another notable AI-powered tool that assists in content creation. It offers various writing templates, generates marketing copy, and even provides blog post ideas. This tool is a valuable resource for marketers looking to streamline their content creation process.

Understanding your customers’ sentiments and perceptions is vital in shaping your marketing strategies. Fortunately, AI has your back with sophisticated sentiment analysis tools. Let’s explore a couple of renowned options.

By analyzing customer feedback, reviews, and social media conversations, MonkeyLearn provides valuable insights into how your brand is perceived. It enables you to identify positive and negative sentiment, helping you make data-driven marketing decisions.

It provides advanced text analytics, helping you uncover sentiment, emotions, and opinions in customer feedback and online content. Lexalytics offers valuable insights that allow you to gauge brand perception and adjust your marketing strategies accordingly.

Keeping up with the ever-changing market trends is crucial for staying ahead of the competition. Thanks to AI-powered trend spotting tools, marketers can now ride the wave of success effortlessly.
Google Trends is a widely-used tool that provides insights into the popularity and search volume of specific topics over time. It allows you to identify trending topics, compare interest between different terms, and uncover regional trends. With Google Trends, you can align your marketing efforts with what’s currently capturing the attention of your audience.

AI tools have unleashed a new era of possibilities within marketing departments. From content creation to sentiment analysis and trend spotting, ChatGPT and its AI counterparts are revolutionizing the way marketers operate. Embrace the AI magic and let it propel your marketing efforts to new heights.
Remember, while AI tools are powerful, they are most effective when complementing human creativity and expertise. By embracing these tools and harnessing their capabilities, you’ll unlock new levels of efficiency and innovation in your marketing strategies. So, let the AI magic guide you, and prepare to witness marketing like never before!

Overall, letting any AI tool generate content without that supervision, curation, and editing is a dangerous practice. The technology has come a long, long way in a very short period of time, but it isn’t completely independent. The tools themselves will warn you, but the accuracy of information is not guaranteed for everything from basic facts to the dots that it connects. In fact, I had to try several times to get resources that actually existed and weren’t just made up by the bot.
While learning how to write good prompts and churning out content en masse may make you a few bucks on Fiverr, it isn’t a way to produce quality content and in no way replaces the need for human writers and editors. My experience has been that it is more of a starting point or an ideation tool.
I use tools such as ChatGPT to give me ideas on other ways to word emails, suggest topics that I may not have thought of otherwise, or just get me past the initial writer’s block I often get when writing blog posts. The common wisdom around BizStream is that AI can get you about 60% there, but it is up to you to take that and turn it into something quality and usable.
Should you be using tools like ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, Midjourney, Jasper, etc, in your everyday workflow? Absolutely. You’d have to pry GitHub Copilot out of the cold dead hands of most of our developers here. They are just that, though, tools. Maybe in another 10-15 years, we will be able to farm out a lot more total content creation to AI, but for now, at least, keep doing what you do best and let AI make you even better!

Website Design for Mobile: The Big and Small of It
There are many important things to consider when designing your website for use on a smaller mobile device. Not thinking through the user flows or organization of content on these smaller devices can add unintended or unnecessary barriers to your customers reaching the information they are looking for.Here are six of the top items to think through in order to design an optimal mobile user experience.
Simple navigation offers a clear and intuitive way to transition between screens and locate desired content. Make sure the most important sections of your site are visible with one click of the mobile menu.
See our work for HealthFitness
Ensure that the controls in your design are large enough to facilitate easy thumb and finger tapping. Using larger controls will prevent user frustration while interacting with your website on a small device. Make sure to test on actual devices to ensure ease of use.
See our work for Zee Zees
Avoid overloading the interface with excessive information. Arrange your content in a manner that presents users with a clear understanding of available features. Minimize clutter and display only essential content on the screen.
View our work for Commercial Food Sanitation
Most modern mobile devices have a high-resolution screen. So, even though the screen is physically smaller, the pixel resolution can be the same, or sometimes higher, than some desktop or laptop monitors. Make sure the images served to mobile devices have been scaled to look their best on mobile devices while also optimized to not hinder page load.
See our work for BDO USA, LLP
Take into consideration the limited size of the mobile screen and increase the font size to enhance readability and comprehension. Make sure to test your font sizes on actual devices to ensure optimal legibility and spacing.
See our work for Ariens
For a website that needs to perform on desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms, ensure a seamless user experience across devices. Maintain similarity in the user interface and organize content effectively on smaller devices to provide a user-friendly, consistent experience.
See our work for Vermeer
All of these items, when planned and executed well, will make the experience of using your website on a mobile device much more pleasant and useful. Your customer comes to your website for information. The easier you can make it for them to get that information, the better.

Creating an Inclusive Web Experience: 7 Tips for Website Accessibility
Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites/content in a way that allows people with disabilities to access and use them effectively. This includes people with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities. The goal of accessibility is to ensure that all individuals can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites, similar to non-disabled users. This is achieved through designs and development techniques (including the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers and keyboard navigation). Making websites accessible not only benefits people with disabilities but also benefits all users by creating a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.
Not only is web accessibility good practice, but it’s also a legal requirement in many countries. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in various areas of public life. Title III of the ADA requires places of public accommodation, including websites, to be accessible to people with disabilities.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG, is a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provide a framework for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG is widely recognized as the global standard for web accessibility and is used as a reference by many countries and organizations in their web accessibility regulations and policies.
Failure to comply with these legal standards and regulations could result in lawsuits, fines, or other legal actions. Website owners should ensure that their websites comply with the relevant accessibility standards and regulations in their country or region to avoid legal liabilities and promote equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities.
Web accessibility allows people of all abilities to have the same level of access to online services, information, and opportunities. In the long run, this can help improve quality of life and reduce isolation by allowing people with disabilities to participate in online activities such as socializing, shopping, and learning. Web accessibility also demonstrates social responsibility by promoting equal access and opportunities for people with disabilities. By designing websites that are accessible to people with disabilities, website owners can create a more inclusive and welcoming online environment that benefits everyone.
Web accessibility requires websites to have clear and consistent navigation structures that make it easy for users to find what they are looking for, which benefits all users. It also requires websites to provide text alternatives for images and videos, which benefits users who use screen readers or have visual impairments by allowing them to understand the content of a website. Web accessibility requires websites to be keyboard-accessible, meaning that users should be able to navigate and interact with a website using only a keyboard. Accessibility can also positively impact loading times by requiring efficient and optimized code, which directly impacts website performance. It also requires websites to have consistent designs and layouts, which makes it easier for users to understand and navigate the website.
There are several ways to make websites accessible. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
Alt tags provide a text alternative to images on a website, making them accessible to people with visual impairments who use screen readers.
Headings help users navigate through a website, and they are especially important for people who use screen readers. Use descriptive headings that accurately convey the content of the page or section.
Videos and audio content should have transcripts and captions to make them accessible to people with hearing impairments.
Use clear and simple language on your website to make it easy to understand for people with cognitive impairments.
People with motor impairments may not be able to use a mouse. Ensure that all functions on your website can be accessed using only the keyboard.
Ensure that the color contrast on your website is high enough to make it accessible for people with visual impairments.
Finally, test your website for accessibility using tools such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.
In conclusion, accessibility on websites is crucial for creating a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users. By following the tips above, website owners and developers can ensure that their website is accessible to people with a range of abilities, and in doing so, they are helping to create a more equitable and accessible online world.

BizStream Experts Take the Stage at Beer City Code 2023
Get ready for an incredible day of knowledge and excitement at Beer City Code in Grand Rapids, MI! This event is jam-packed with talks from a lineup of brilliant minds, including our own Brian McKeiver and Rex Rainey, who will share their expertise on headless CMS​ and how to design for development. You’ll also get the chance to stop by the BizStream booth! Keep reading to find out more.
Beer City Code is an annual conference for software developers in Grand Rapids, MI. Software creators of all types are welcome, even those who don’t care for beer.
The main conference is held Saturday, August 5, with optional day-long workshops the day before, Friday, August 4.
This year, you’ll have the opportunity to learn from two of our experts speaking at the event. Here’s a closer look at their sessions.
Using a Headless and API-First approach comes with a problem. With only an API (or multiple) to start with, how do you know you are budling your project codebase (“head”) to account for best practices such as caching, security, and best performance? How do you know what path allows for the most flexibility with the least headaches? It isn’t the same as just having a database and template engine on the backend.
SaaS-based Headless solutions are a powerful way to build modern enterprise-class websites. They are also becoming more popular by the day.
Luckily, multiple solutions have now been built around these “API first” platforms. Some best practice architecture patterns have emerged as a result, and this session aims to share them. Attendees will see and learn these patterns for designing, building, and deploying Headless based solutions.
Leave the session with proven architecture patterns and how to apply them when working with a Headless CMS and API first stack.
Time: Saturday, August 5, 11:00 am – 11:50 amRoom: 6
Overview of how our agency structures our Figma files for ease of use throughout the design process. From initial discovery meetings with the client, working through iterations, gathering feedback, all the way to approvals, and into implementation. Our designers and frontend developers have worked together to develop a system for organizing our Figma files that works well for both the designers’ and developers’ needs. Creating a “source of truth” that all team members can rely on.
Time: Saturday, August 5, 10:00 am – 10:50 amRoom: 6
We invite you to drop by our booth at the event to learn more about BizStream, grab some awesome SWAG, and participate in our exciting prize giveaway!

Creating a Custom Form Component for a Page Builder Widget in Kentico 13
In this post, we will explore creating custom form components for Page Builder widgets. We will create an Icon Selector form control allowing content administrators to pull icons from a selected font.
This solution is based on a Kentico 13 Xperience website using MVC and ASP.NET Core.
Building Page Builder widgets is about creating reusable components for content administrators to create beautiful pages. Once you have your requirements for the widget, you can begin writing the solution. In our case, we need to create a button that will support the following items:
With the above requirements, something jumps out with two of them – styles for the button as well as the inclusion of an icon. In order to tackle that problem, we need a form control for the widget so content administrators can choose which icon they want to use.
The desired outcome will be a text box with a button. When the textbox receives focus or the button is clicked, a container that looks similar to a drop-down will appear with the icons showing. Clicking an icon will select one, filling in the textbox with the CSS class of the icon.
To create the Page Builder Form Component, we will need to make the following files:
We will be placing these files in our Web project since Page Builder is driven by the website’s frontend.
In the Web project, we will start with the class file. I created the following file:
Web/{yourViewPath}/IconSelector/IconSelectorFormComponent.cs
The first thing to be done is to register the component. Add the following line above the namespace:
Next, you will want the IconSelectorFormComponent to inherit from the TextInputComponent, allowing us to extend the built-in Kentico component.
Then, you will create a new public constant to support the component registration we did above.
So far, your class file should look something like this:
We still need to create a few things to tie the classes together for the icon font. To do that, we need to download the font we want to use and create a class with the CSS font classes as string values.
Once you have an icon font, you can assemble the class file.
Web/Models/Configuration/IconFont.cs
The class variables are strings named to match the keys of our key-value pairs in the JSON file to deserialize properly. A snippet of the class:
Let’s jump back over to IconSelectorFormComponent.cs and finish off the class. We will declare a new method called GetIconClasses(). This method will read the class through Reflection and use LINQ to return an IEnumerable<string> of our CSS classes.
At this point, we are ready to create the view for the form component. In the Web project, I created the following file:
Web/{yourViewPath}/IconSelector/_IconSelectorFormComponent.cshtml
First, we will want to do a couple of imports as well as identify the model:
One thing to keep in mind when developing form controls for Page Builder is that there are likely to be multiple widgets on a page at the same time. To make this work correctly, we will use Razor to create a unique identifier for each control on the page. We also need to give our input a class to support the JavaScript we will write to handle our events. To do that, we first have to remove the class attribute since the property is read-only, but we must also maintain the original classes.
Next up is the presentation, where we will declare an input, a button for the input, and a drop-down of buttons for selecting the icon visually. The drop-down will be hidden by default, and we will show and hide it with events in the JavaScript we will write after the presentation markup.
We need to include the JavaScript in the markup file because we need to use the GUID that we created so we get the correct elements when there are multiple instances on the same page.
We will add click events for the buttons and a focus and blur event for a better user experience.
Finally, we can wrap things up by styling the form component. We want the input to match the rest of the form and the drop-down to look nice and hover absolutely positioned underneath the input.
You can get creative with your classes or be a bit heavy-handed with some important declarations on some styles. For the sake of this tutorial, I went the heavy-handed route, as the main focus is the functionality above, and these styles will only be used for this particular use case.
Note – we aren’t covering this topic in this tutorial, but I am using Tailwind CSS for styling to keep things simple.
In conclusion, the custom form component created in this tutorial offers a wealth of benefits for content editors working with Kentico 13. Developing the ability to add custom icons and easily reuse the component in future widgets, creates a powerful tool for enhancing the flexibility and functionality of page builder widgets. With this component, content editors can work more efficiently and with greater ease, resulting in an improved overall user experience for website visitors. Extending Kentico in this way, demonstrates the platform’s robust capabilities for customization and adaptation to specific business needs.

The Benefits of Going Headless with Storyblok
If this post has reached you, then odds are you have heard of the term “headless CMS,” or there’s a chance that this is the first time you have encountered this term and want to learn more about it. So then, what is a headless CMS, and how can it benefit your next project or evolve your current one?
In this article, we will explore the benefits of using a headless CMS (Content Management System) such as Storyblok and why it’s a better solution than the traditional CMS.
A headless CMS separates the content from the presentation layer; this architecture is known as composable architecture. In the architecture of a traditional CMS, content, and presentation are tightly integrated. This means that making changes to the presentation layer often requires changes to the underlying content structure. By keeping these two separate using a headless CMS such as Storyblok, it allows for greater flexibility and scalability since changes to one layer do not affect the other.
A headless CMS provides content creators with a user-friendly interface to allow them to manage their content within. Developers can then make use of APIs to gather the content and display it on any device. With this, your app or website can have the desired look and feel you want it to have without having to affect the content that’s present.
While a traditional CMS platform can be user-friendly, they often lack in performance, customization, and the flexibility and scalability that was mentioned earlier for which a headless CMS can provide. Let’s talk about how a headless CMS can improve your project in those three areas that a traditional CMS struggles to keep up in.
With the understanding of what a headless CMS is and how it compares to a traditional CMS, let’s now take a look at the powerful headless CMS that I keep referring to called Storyblok, and why it could be a great option for you to consider for your next project!
As you can see, a headless CMS can provide numerous benefits for your next project. By separating the content from the presentation layer, it allows for improved performance, customization, personalization, and greater flexibility along with scalability. The headless CMS Storyblok offers a platform that is developer-friendly, user-friendly, and has a powerful visual editor making it easy to manage your website or app’s content. It can also allow your business to create a more efficient and personalized experience for your audience across multiple channels, making it a great option for any project.
Looking to take your brand from ideation to launch? Our seasoned team of over 35 developers, designers, and digital strategists is here to help. Reach out to us today to discover how BizStream + Storyblok can help bring your digital project to life!

AI in Juvenile Justice Software
Last week, I attended an event by West Michigan Tech Talent, “Tech Trends with Keith Brophy.” Keith is a futurist, Michigan Entrepreneur of the Year winner, and a long-time speaker on areas of digital transformation, including AI, Machine Learning, the Internet of Things, and Cyber Security.
As you can imagine, Keith’s tech trends this year were focused on Artificial Technology (AI) and how it will change the world. This wasn’t a big surprise, as AI, ChatGPT, Bard, and other technology have been filling headlines and social media feeds. What was a big surprise to me was his prediction that AI would change law enforcement.
Keith’s take was that Police and AI would come together, providing guidance to officers in the field to help de-escalate situations. Body cameras utilizing AI technology to read facial expressions and body language with audio feeding in the ear of the officer providing prompts to guide the officer to a better outcome. This was a novel use of AI I hadn’t heard of before – using tech already in use combined with AI to assist in situations where an officer may not have experience or a mental health professional can’t be on site. That use was very interesting and got me thinking of how we could use AI in our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software.
AI has been tried in the court system and has had its share of problems. Bias has been a historical issue with AI’s use in the justice system. In 2016, ProPublica highlighted this issue in an article titled “Machine Bias,” which scrutinized predictive policing software (AI) and revealed its racial bias against black individuals. ProPublica isn’t alone in publishing information about AI use in the justice system; both The Atlantic and the UCLA Law Review published articles in 2019 highlighting the risks of perpetuating systemic biases, lack of transparency, and potential for erroneous decision-making when relying on AI algorithms.
We have explored using AI to predict recidivism or the success of a juvenile based on data stored in our system but have yet to put it to use based on the potential pitfalls outlined in the articles mentioned above. If prediction isn’t a fair use of the technology, how else could we use AI to better the experience of our users and help benefit the youth they are working with?
The truth is some of our YouthCenter users are using AI without even realizing they’re using AI, with voice-to-text. With voice-to-text, they’re dictating their case notes rather than typing them in. It’s such a popular feature that I’ve gotten hugs at conferences from caseworkers that utilize voice-to-text to enter their case notes. These case managers or probation officers (POs) are ecstatic because they’re not bogged down by the administrative duties of case management, and it allows them the ability to spend additional time with the youth to coach them to better outcomes.
Voice-to-text is a great way to use AI to benefit the user without introducing bias. We’re not alone in this technology use. Medical startups like Ambience and DeepScribe are transforming the way Doctors, nurses, and other practitioners interact with patients. No more typing data into an EMR; the technology listens, transcribes, and pulls important data from the conversation into electronic medical records (EMR).
One of the unique features of YouthCenter is the Client Activity Log. The Activity Log is like a Facebook or Twitter timeline of any interaction or event with the youth. Events and entries are listed in chronological order, grouped by date, and ordered by time. The Activity log can be filtered by event or searched. While the Activity log provides a detailed listing of everything, it can be challenging to get a big-picture overview of what’s happening with the youth at a glance.
Large language models, like GPT-3.5 (also known as ChatGPT), are excellent at summarizing complex information. AI-powered systems have the ability to quickly analyze and comprehend vast amounts of data. Data could include case notes, drug tests, program progress, and assessment scores. By processing this information, AI can generate concise and easy-to-understand summaries tailored to the needs of users, in our case, case workers, administrators, or POs. This not only saves time and resources for those involved in the justice system but also helps ensure that critical details are effectively communicated to all relevant parties. The use of AI in this context paves the way for more efficient and informed decision-making, ultimately improving the outcomes for young individuals in the juvenile justice system.
I listen to Spotify’s “Daily Drive” on the way to the office almost every day. It’s a short, customized summary of the day’s news combined with the music I listen to. It’s a great way to start the day. What if I could get a summary of my day sent to me? Imagine if you were a supervisor and could get a short summary of all the clients in your jurisdiction and listen to it on the way to the office. You’re up to speed before you even walk in the door. Combining the AI summary capabilities with text-to-voice could make this possible.
What could make this even more interesting is using technology like Spotify has done with their AI DJ and voice-mimicking technology like Microsoft’s VALL-E to build out a custom YouthCenter secure audio stream. Summaries could then be read in the voice and tone of the primary caseworker working with the specific youth. If you’re a supervisor, you can get an update on the cases your team is working on in the voice of the case manager working with the youth case.
All these new use cases for AI in Juvenile Justice are great, but there are a few things we need to think about, and that’s data security and privacy. Nobody should be copying and pasting any juvenile data into ChatGPT to get summaries. Lucky for us, we have our very own Microsoft Azure MVP on staff here who keeps us up to speed on this technology and issues like privacy.
Our YouthCenter Juvenile Case Management Software is hosted in the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud, which adds additional layers of security for our clients and us. The Azure OpenAI service is also available in the Government Cloud, allowing for the separation of juvenile data from other data sources through enterprise-grade security, role-based access control (RBAC), and private networks. Keeping juvenile data secure and away from others who shouldn’t have access to it is a high priority. We take that security very seriously and will examine any AI technology and its access and sharing before we implement it.
We’re happy to be a partner with Microsoft in AI technology. They’ve developed a Responsible AI Standard that addresses many of the concerns with previous implementations of AI through their six principles for responsible AI: accountability, inclusiveness, reliability and safety, fairness, transparency, and privacy and security. Those 6 principles guide the way in which Microsoft designs, builds, and tests AI systems. Their commitment to inclusiveness, transparency, privacy, and security makes them an ideal partner for us in building AI technology into our juvenile case management system.
The potential for AI to transform the juvenile justice system is huge. There are ways to harness the power of AI responsibly. Focusing on applications like voice-to-text, summarization, and personalized updates, we can improve efficiency, communication, and overall outcomes for young individuals without perpetuating biases. As we implement the technology, we need to be aware of and address data security and privacy concerns.
As we continue to innovate and refine our YouthCenter Juvenile Justice Case Management software, we are excited about the opportunities that AI presents to support caseworkers, probation officers, and, most importantly, the youth they serve. By responsibly integrating AI, we can help to revolutionize the juvenile justice system and create a brighter future for all.
If you’re a YouthCenter client of ours and want early access to the AI capabilities we’re adding, register here.
AI technologies were used to create this article. Tools including Grammarly and ChatGPT were used to shape the article, modify the text, and in some cases, generate text in the article.

5 Benefits of Automated Testing in Web Development
Working in website development is an exciting and fast-paced career. We are consistently developing and updating many different sites at any given time. As features are added, and changes are made, it’s essential to keep quality in mind at every stage of the development process. What is the best way to ensure top-notch quality on a website? Manual testing is a great place to start, but it can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when there are too many changes and updates to keep track of. That is where automated testing comes in; my favorite method of testing to date.
Automated testing is the process of using software tools to run predefined tests on a website or web application. These tests can check the functionality, performance, security, and usability of a site in a faster and more efficient way. Automated tests are typically run on a regular basis, allowing developers and testers to quickly identify any issues and fix them before they become major problems.
Although there are many different reasons to implement automated testing into your development process, there are a few main benefits that outweigh the rest. As a quality assurance specialist, automation is a huge help in my day-to-day workflow. Here are the top five benefits of automated testing:
Automated testing significantly reduces the time required to test a website. In traditional manual testing, every feature and function of the website must be tested manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. With automated testing, test cases are written once and can be executed repeatedly without any manual intervention. This speeds up the testing process and allows QA specialists to focus on more critical tasks. Additionally, automated test scripts execute extremely fast, meaning that a large number of tests can be run after deployments or nightly.
Manual testing can lack accuracy due to human factors such as fatigue, distraction, and personal biases. Automated testing eliminates these factors and ensures that every test case is executed in the same way every time. This consistency improves the accuracy of testing and ensures that defects are identified and resolved before the website is deployed to production. Additionally, automated testing allows QA specialists to test a large number of scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to test manually.
Automated testing can significantly reduce the overall cost of testing for website development. While there is an initial investment required for setting up the testing infrastructure and writing test cases, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. Automated testing reduces the need for manual testing, which is time-consuming and expensive. It also reduces the risk of regression issues arising in production, which can be costly to fix. The earlier an issue is caught in the development process, the cheaper it is to fix it, which is why automated testing should be implemented as early as possible.
Automated testing allows the QA team to test a wider range of scenarios and use cases than would be possible with manual testing. This increased test coverage ensures that defects and issues are identified and resolved before the website is in the clients’ hands. Additionally, automated testing can simulate real-world scenarios that would be difficult or impossible to replicate manually. This ensures that the website is tested thoroughly and that it meets the needs of end-users.
Automated testing provides valuable insights into the performance and behavior of a website during testing. Unlike manual testing, where feedback is often limited to human observation and documentation, automated testing generates detailed reports that include metrics such as response times and error rates. These reports can help quality assurance specialists identify issues and analyze data to optimize testing strategies.Automated testing also offers real-time feedback, allowing for rapid iteration and improvement during website development. With this enhanced feedback, teams can quickly identify and resolve issues, leading to a more efficient and effective development process. Additionally, this feedback can help teams to identify trends and patterns that might be difficult to spot with manual testing and can lead to further improvements in the quality and reliability of a website.
In conclusion, automated testing is a powerful tool that can help development teams ensure that their websites are high-quality and relatively error-free. Although it’s nearly impossible to release bug-free code, automated tests can still provide a lot of peace of mind that the main functionality is working as expected. If you are not already using automated testing in your development process, I highly recommend setting it up on a small scale to see if it’s right for your organization. It will take some time to learn and implement, but the benefits are substantial.

BizStream’s Experience With a Compressed Workweek
The four-day workweek, also known as the “compressed workweek,” has been gaining popularity as a way to improve employee productivity and well-being while also benefiting the environment. Over the summer of 2022, BizStream decided to give the shortened workweek a try for 13 weeks. We did this by shortening our weekly meetings and reducing our utilization goals. Like everything, there are tradeoffs, but overall, it was a beneficial experiment that we’ll likely be trying again. After switching back to 40-hour workweeks, we held a company-wide discussion and poll about what worked, what didn’t, what our goals are for next time, and the benefits.
The post-experiment survey results showed overwhelming support, with 100% of the participants saying they would like to try it again. Some of the benefits specifically mentioned were reduced stress and burnout, which was largely attributed to the long weekend or shorter days, depending on how the 32 hours were split throughout the week. As a result, participants mentioned feeling more refreshed and productive while at work.
The extra day also allowed teams to schedule team bonding activities. Go-Karts, axe throwing, and a trip to Dave and Busters are just a few examples of the activities that teams enjoyed together.
Personally, I found the compressed workweek extremely beneficial. I was able to schedule appointments, run errands, take more time to be with my kids, and volunteer. Having that extra time to focus on my family and myself was amazing.
Despite the overwhelming support for the shorter workweek, there were some issues mentioned. These include elevated stress levels in client-facing employees and team managers, less time for teams to communicate, and any issues with professionalism were amplified in the compressed workweek. For example, showing up late in a shorter week has a much bigger impact on the team since they have less time together. The same is true for any issues with communication. For example, if team members are not clearly communicating with each other, then any problems that arise from that will be felt more acutely in a shorter time frame.
The post-experiment survey clearly identified some improvements we could make to ensure future 4-day workweeks go more smoothly. Here’s what we learned:
First attempts sometimes go poorly. No matter how much thought and planning go into something, there are almost always unforeseen issues. What matters is how you react to them and what you learn. BizSteam clearly learned a lot from this experience and is dedicated to making future attempts work better.
With 100% of the survey participants saying they would like to do it again, there have been a couple of ideas put forward to make that happen. One of the ideas is to work a 36-hour workweek instead of 32. This would still allow for shorter days while also keeping BizStream open on Fridays. Overall, BizStream has shown that the four day workweek, while tricky at times, is completely doable. In addition, the increased time away from the office allows our team members to slow down and spend time with their families or get out and enjoy our short (but sweet) Michigan summers.

Kentico 12 Hotfix 12.0.101 Email Sending Issues: Quick Fix for Non-TLS/SSL Connections
In Kentico version 12.0.101, there was a change to the underlying implementation of the email provider. Namely, support for OAuth 2.0 was added. On the surface, this change appears to be beneficial; however, this introduces a breaking change. In environments that use unsecure SMTP servers, emails were failing. They were being routed through the new MailKit implementation. By default, MailKit will require the connection made to the SMTP server to use TLS/SSL.
Currently, Kentico version 12.0.102 has been released and provides ISmtpClientFactory. This interface allows us to create a MailKit client. If you have a more advanced use case, the following solution will likely not be beneficial for you. Instead, you can upgrade to version 12.0.102 and create the fix that fits your needs.
As a quick fix, what we’ve done is override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client from the System.Net.Mail namespace. The methods SendEmailInternal and SendEmailAsyncInternal are where we override the logic. Since the internal email provider has limited accessibility levels, we needed to copy various methods from the original provider into our custom provider.
In conclusion, the introduction of support for OAuth 2.0 in Kentico version 12.0.101 was a welcome change, but it also brought about an unintended consequence for environments that use unsecure SMTP servers. This led to email failures when routing through the new MailKit implementation, which required TLS/SSL connections to the SMTP server. A quick fix for the issue is to override the email provider to only use the original SMTP client, which requires copying various methods into a custom provider due to limited accessibility levels. Overall, this experience highlights the importance of careful consideration and testing of changes to underlying implementations in software updates.

5 Questions You Should Ask Yourself About Your Company’s Brand Experience
A strong brand identity is critical for any business that wants to stand out in today’s competitive market. Your brand is not just your logo or your website; it’s the entire experience that your customers have with your company. To ensure that your brand experience is consistent, relevant, and engaging, there are five key questions that you should ask yourself.
A brand guide and a style guide can be invaluable tools in building a comprehensive and consistent brand identity for your company.
A brand guide outlines the fundamental elements of your brand, such as its vision, values, and messaging. It provides guidance on how your brand should be presented across all channels, ensuring that your branding is consistent and aligned with your company’s mission and goals. A well-crafted brand guide can help you maintain brand consistency, build brand recognition, and establish a unique identity in the market.
A style guide, on the other hand, focuses on the visual aspects of your brand, including the use of colors, typography, imagery, and other design elements. It provides clear guidelines on how to use these elements to create a cohesive and visually appealing brand image. A style guide can help your team understand how to use your brand’s visual elements consistently, reducing the risk of confusion or misrepresentation.
Although brand guides and style guides can exist on their own, they’re even more effective when combined together. Incorporating style guide sections within the overall brand guide creates a more robust, single source of assets and guidelines. Having well-documented brand and style guidelines creates a strong and consistent brand identity that resonates with your audience and helps you stand out from your competitors. By providing clear guidance on how to represent your brand, these combined guides save time and resources by streamlining the branding process and ensuring that all team members are aligned.

It’s not necessary to update your brand colors every year to keep up with the latest design trends, but incorporating a modern color palette can certainly have its advantages. Using contemporary color schemes can help your brand appear fresh, relevant, and appealing to a younger audience.In addition to colors, having a modern logo design can also make a significant impact on your brand image. A well-designed logo with a contemporary look can signal to your audience that your brand is up-to-date and keeping pace with the latest design trends. This can help you to stand out from your competitors and attract new customers.However, it’s important to strike a balance between modernity and timelessness. A brand’s visual identity should be distinctive and recognizable, not simply a reflection of current trends. Therefore, it’s crucial to work with a skilled designer who can create a visually compelling and timeless logo that also incorporates modern design elements.Incorporating modern design elements into your brand can enhance its appeal and help you connect with your audience. By striking a balance between modernity and timelessness, you can create a visual identity that represents your brand’s values and resonates with your customers for years to come.

Consistency is key when it comes to branding across all your digital and non-digital platforms. It’s essential to ensure that your brand’s colors, messaging, logo, and other visual elements are consistent across all channels. This will help your audience recognize and remember your brand easily, and it will also reinforce your company’s vision and values.
Creating a consistent brand experience is crucial for building strong customer relationships. Imagine having a great customer experience with a company during the initial stages of a sale, only to discover that the final invoice letterhead displays a logo from 10 years ago or the website’s color scheme is completely different from the rest of the company’s branding. Such inconsistencies can create confusion and erode trust in the brand, potentially leading to lost customers.
To avoid such situations, it’s important to pay attention to every detail of your brand’s representation across all platforms, both digital and non-digital. Whether it’s your website, social media profiles, or printed materials, ensure that your branding is consistent and reflects your company’s vision and values. This will help to build a strong brand identity that resonates with your audience and creates a lasting impression.

Your visual brand should differentiate your company from the competition. It should be memorable, unique, and instantly recognizable, making it easier for consumers to identify and remember your brand.
A visually distinctive and memorable brand will help your company stand out in a crowded market and make a lasting impression on your target audience. When your visual brand is unique and recognizable, it creates a sense of familiarity and trust, which can lead to increased customer loyalty and brand advocacy. Additionally, a strong visual brand can help you attract new customers who are drawn to your brand’s distinct look and feel.
Overall, a differentiated, memorable, and recognizable visual brand is crucial in building a successful brand and achieving long-term business success.

Your visual brand should be adaptable to different contexts and mediums, such as print, digital, and social media. It should be designed to look great in various sizes and formats while maintaining its consistency and effectiveness. Adapting your visual brand to different mediums and formats is crucial in reaching and engaging with your target audience in today’s digital age.
Your brand’s visual elements should be optimized for various mediums such as websites, social media platforms, email marketing, mobile apps, and print materials, among others. Your visual brand should be designed to look great in different sizes and formats without compromising its consistency and effectiveness. This means that your logo, colors, typography, and other visual elements should be recognizable and consistent across all mediums and formats. Adapting your visual brand to different contexts and mediums will help you reach a wider audience and maximize the impact of your marketing efforts, leading to increased brand awareness and recognition.

Your brand experience is critical to your business’ success. By addressing these five key questions, you can ensure that your brand is complete, modern, and consistent. Investing in a strong brand identity can help you stand out from your competitors, build trust with your audience, and ultimately drive growth for your business.

Maximizing Your Kentico Site’s UX With Fallback Redirects
In the fast-paced world of website management, changes are inevitable. Pages may move or be removed, and links can become outdated, leading to frustrating 404 errors for visitors and negatively impacting search engine rankings. That’s where fallback redirects come in. By using these redirects, you can ensure that visitors are always directed to the correct pages, even if the original URL is no longer valid. This creates a more ideal user experience, helps maintain search engine rankings, and keeps your Kentico website running smoothly. In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of custom fallback redirects and provide best practices for implementing them on your website.
Having a fallback redirect can be a lifesaver for websites with frequently changing or moving content. Imagine a well-maintained structure that guides visitors to their desired destination, with a news landing page to help them navigate to individual news nodes. But what happens when a news article is archived, and the page can’t be found? It would be helpful to have a fallback redirect. With this tool, you can ensure a flawless user experience by routing visitors back to the news landing page, even when content disappears. Using a fallback redirect will provide a better user experience that will keep visitors coming back for more.
If you’re managing a website with blogs that use a structure like site/blogs/(document-name), a site restructuring or migration can pose a challenge. For example, without a landing page for blogs on the new site, visitors may encounter 404 errors when trying to access a blog that has been moved or removed. By implementing a fallback routing for blogs, you can ensure that visitors will be seamlessly routed to the news landing page when they try to access a blog affected by the restructuring.
In addition to scenarios where content is frequently changing or moving, there are also cases where content needs to be removed from a website because it is time-sensitive, such as events that have passed or promotions that have ended. Automatic archiving can be a useful tool in this situation, as it can move content no longer relevant to a separate archive rather than deleting it altogether. However, even with automatic archiving in place, visitors may still try to access this content after it has been moved, resulting in 404 errors. Search engines may also be led astray by URLs that have been moved or deleted. By using a fallback redirect, you can ensure that visitors are routed to an appropriate page, such as an archived events page or a promotions archive, when they try to access content that has been removed due to time sensitivity. This will also preserve a consistent user experience and search engine rankings, even during a website cleanup.
Redirects play a critical role in website maintenance, ensuring a seamless user experience when content changes or moves. But how do you create these redirects, and where should they be stored? To maintain a clean and organized project, redirects should be added to a new class in a location for extensions. This allows for easy management and ensures a consistent naming convention. Then, when a 404 error occurs, the URL is checked against these rules to determine if a redirect should be triggered. It’s like having a virtual gatekeeper for your website, ensuring that visitors always find the right content. Proper implementation of redirects can help prevent frustration for visitors and ensure that your website remains user-friendly. Following best practices for creating and checking redirects, you can become an expert in website maintenance and optimization. Below is an example of a redirect extension to ensure that child pages are redirected to the landing page in the case of a 404 error.
To use the custom redirect rules, they must be added to the Configure method in Startup.cs (or the app section, depending on the version of .NET). This is done by calling the appropriate method within the IApplicationBuilder, such as app.UseCustomLandingRedirects(). Including the code below in your startup configuration ensures that your website directs visitors to the right content, even when pages are moved or deleted. This helps to maintain a positive user experience on your website.
Once the custom redirect rules have been implemented, site visitors and search engines will always be redirected to the correct pages, even if the original URL is no longer valid. It’s also possible to create new custom redirect classes and add them to the startup configuration to fall back to multiple URLs. In addition, by changing the page type retrieved, you can specify which page visitors should be directed to in the case of a 404 error. This allows for greater flexibility and control over your website’s content and navigation.
One of the great things about custom redirects is their flexibility. You can create as many fallback redirects as needed to ensure visitors always find what they’re looking for. Whether you’re handling news articles, blog posts, event pages, or other types of content, custom redirects ensure that visitors are always directed to the appropriate landing page. By taking a comprehensive approach to custom redirects and customizing them to meet your specific needs, you can create a highly effective website maintenance strategy that keeps your visitors engaged and satisfied. Additionally, by following the best practices outlined in this article and staying on top of changes to your website’s structure and content, you can ensure that your custom redirects continue to provide value and enhance the user experience over time.
By taking advantage of custom redirects, website owners and developers can ensure that visitors always find the content they’re looking for, even if a page has been moved, deleted, or archived. Creating custom redirects may require some effort upfront, but the benefits of user satisfaction and search engine optimization can be significant. In addition, by following the best practices outlined in this article, such as identifying the need for redirects, creating and checking redirect rules, and adding them to the startup configuration, you can become an expert in website maintenance and optimization. Ultimately, custom redirects are a powerful tool that can help you keep your website running smoothly and keep visitors engaged and satisfied.

3 Tips to Get the Most Out of Your Project Discovery
You know that your current website has seen better days. It’s utilizing old technology, old branding, an old and possibly outdated content model… It’s time for an overhaul. You prioritized the build of a new website as a major initiative in the current fiscal year. You’ve worked with key stakeholders to identify wants and needs for your new site. With that list, you evaluated design and development firms that can help you achieve your goals and objectives.
You have your “A-Team” selected, and you’re ready to go.
The A-Team has laid out a plan that includes discovery, design, and implementation, which sounds great. However, you really just want to get started. You’re chomping at the bit.
“Never fear,” says the A-Team. “We’ve got your back. We promise that discovery is going to help define your objectives, breathe life into your goals, and establish a pathway to the final product you’ve envisioned.”
“That sounds fantastic,” you say to the A-Team. “How do we make it happen?”
Your organization has put a lot of thought (and probably dollars) into building out a set of requirements that make the most sense for your project. That information lives inside a brain trust that, if left untapped, runs the risk of leaving vital knowledge out that could be crucial in informing the direction of your project. A good discovery team helps ensure that the work you’ve done in gathering requirements is honored and shared so a plan can be assembled (see what I did there?).
But what if we don’t know all the requirements yet, you might ask. That’s okay too. A good agency will ensure that they also bring the right people to the table. People who can ask the right questions and unlock the knowledge that resides within your organization to build out that plan and chart a path forward.
Kentico or Jamstack? Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Azure? Do you have any non-standard integrations or APIs that aren’t particularly well documented that need to be accounted for? Again, a good discovery team on the agency’s side will do the work of asking these questions so that they can formulate a path toward success. Ensuring that your technical team has a good understanding of their requirements or must-haves is essential to achieving your project’s objectives.
In many instances, organizations have teams dedicated to these areas of focus, and ensuring you have those people as part of your discovery team can ensure that nothing gets missed or forgotten.
This one might seem like a gimme, but I assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. Getting the right people on board ensures that decisions are made that continue to drive the project toward a successful implementation phase. Suppose those people cannot be made available, however, and have schedules that do not permit them to participate in the discovery process. In that case, the information you’ve curated and the technical requirements you’ve assembled will remain unrevealed.Discovery is a commitment. It takes time, consistency, and diligence to ensure that all your project needs get unearthed. Work with your project manager to build out a discovery roadmap that both teams can adhere to, and do your best to ensure that all participants understand the importance of their preparation and participation.
These tips ultimately stack or compound; having the right people in the room ensures we iron out the must-haves of a project and narrow in on the technical specifications to come up with a plan for our clients that is tailored to their needs. Adequate scheduling helps us as an agency navigate the sometimes difficult terrain of discovery and drive to answers and solutions more quickly.We have found these tips to be most beneficial as we’ve worked with hundreds of clients through the discovery process, and we hope this aids you in your discovery journey as well. Finally, if you need strategic experts to help you achieve your goals, we’d love a chance to chat.Best of Luck!

BizStream and BDO USA, LLP Win Another Kentico Site of the Month
Our latest website launch, bdo.com, has just been awarded Site of the Month by Kentico! The recognition acknowledges exceptional projects highlighting Kentico’s versatility and offering a personalized digital experience.
BizStream once again collaborated with BDO USA, LLP to upgrade their site from an older iteration of Kentico to the latest version, Kentico 13, using .NET 6 & ASP.NET Core MVC. Our team assisted in modernizing the site’s back-end while also giving the website a fresh look. Two of the most important goals for BDO were for their editors to have creative control over the content of their pages and for improved search functionality.
Kentico’s Page Builder was extensively utilized to construct a design system of components that translated into highly customizable page widgets. The editors then tailored these widgets according to the behavior of the visitors.
To handle the improved search experience, our team built a custom Azure Cognitive Search Preview Widget for use in the PageBuilder system. This widget empowers editors with search functionality to precisely control related content on pages by narrowing results to specific topics and more based on the visitor’s persona. Editors can also determine the number of results displayed and how they are presented, such as in a carousel or grid format.

A Code First Approach to Kentico Smart Search Settings: Stopping Ambiguous Errors
Kentico Xperience provides an integration with Azure Cognitive Search that allows you to store website content and data within the Azure Search Indexes. After configured, data is populated and kept up to date when changes are made. This allows developers to fully utilize the power of Azure to implement solutions on websites.
When configuring the search indexes, you must set the search settings for every field on every page type. If you have a large site with many page types, this can be a daunting task. It becomes even more problematic when multiple page types contain the same field names. Every search setting must be correct, or either the indexing will fail, or the queries will fail. There is no way to know if you have your settings correct unless you try and rebuild the indexes or, after waiting for the indexes to build and submit a query. Troubleshooting this can be very time-consuming and is exacerbated when you have many page types.
To solve this problem, I’ve chosen a code-first approach using attributes to decorate the fields we want indexed and reflection to get the settings out of the code. For simplicity, we’ll set the settings using a single-run scheduled task. You just need to remember to run this if the page type fields change.
Creating a custom attribute in C# is pretty straightforward. It is just another class, but it inherits the Attribute. With the attribute we create, we also need to include a DisplayName attribute. Our property name will be different from the names that Kentico uses in the settings, so the attribute is there to match the names Kentico expects.
Each property corresponds to a check box on the search settings tab within the page type. Also included are properties for local page indexes.
By using an interface, we can specify which page types should have search enabled. This allows us to turn indexing on and off within code and not on the search configurations screens. Because we are using reflection to gather all the search classes by implementing a Search interface, we can easily identify the page types.
It is a very simple interface containing just the Class Name, which many of the page types might already have.
The first thing that needs to be done when creating our service is creating our interface.
This step isn’t 100% necessary since we are not using dependency injection with our scheduled task, but I’ve added it for code consistency. We cannot create a search index service class and implement the interface.
Sometimes, with reflection, there are assemblies that are referenced that are not loaded. If we try to get the types of that referenced assembly, an exception will be thrown. We need to handle this particular exception properly. We are not interested in those referenced 3rd party assemblies, so we want to ignore them.
As mentioned above, the simplest way to execute this code from the Admin UI is to create a scheduled task. It is a simple scheduled task that creates an instance of the service we created and executes it against a list of page type DataClassInfos.
To actually use the attributes, a new class needs to be created that corresponds with the page types. You could probably use Kentico’s page type code generator and decorate those attributes. Still, any time you re-generate the code, you need to remember that you have attributes in your generated code. The way I have found that works best is to create POCOs (plain Old C# Object) based on the page types. The downside here is making sure you keep them updated when you add/remove fields on the page types.
We can create a Base class with all the common properties that our entity classes inherit. Make sure you do not add attributes to built-in Page Type properties such as NodeID and NodeAliasPath.
With our base class created we can create our entity POCO
Any properties that are not decorated will have all the checkboxes unchecked.
With our attributes added, we can now build our admin project and add our scheduled task.
Setting up and maintaining search indexes can be a very frustrating task, especially when you are dealing with many page types with the same fields that all need to be included in your indexes. Using a code-first approach is just one way to make this process a little easier. Attributes are a way to keep your settings contained in version control, but there are a few caveats. Since the settings are now in version control, any changes you want to make to your indexes must be done with code. You must also keep your POCOs up to date when adding any fields you want to be included in your indexes. I find this inconvenience makes up for the time-consuming complexities when manually managing your search settings.

Why Developers Owe Their Jobs to Philosophers
Philosophy often gets a bad rap for being a pointless and futile endeavor. What does a degree in studying metaphysics, epistemology, or logic get you other than a job at Pizza Hut? As interesting as questions like, “Does God exist?” can be, shouldn’t they be relegated between the hours of one and four in the morning over drinks with friends?
To these critiques, I like to remind people that not only can most of your assumptions and beliefs about the world be traced back to philosophers, there are a lot of pretty cool technologies out there that once only existed in the abstract writings of philosophers until the technology was able to catch up and make practical use from them. Even universities, where so much innovation has been born, originated with Plato in 387 BC when he created the first university called The Academy (which is why education is called academics).
Similarly, there is a lot of terminology in Computer Science that can be traced back to the philosophers who are credited with laying its foundation. If you’ve ever worked with developers, you’ll often hear them use terminologies such as backend logic, languages, objects, arrays, strings, boolean operators, and arguments. Here are some notable philosophers who developed these ideas and why developers owe their jobs to them.
Let’s start with George Boole (1815–1864). Developers who are a bit more attentive may already have an idea of his contributions based on his name. Boole was a mathematician, philosopher, and logician who worked on differential equations (no big deal). While it was not his focus or intention, in attempting to help systemize Aristotelian logic, Boole inadvertently started a movement that would completely replace it. To put this into perspective, Aristotelian logic had been dominant for over 2,000 years. What Boole did was essentially the mathematical equivalent of Copernicus beginning to realize that maybe the Earth was not the center of the universe.
At the time of Boole, Artiotilian logic used syllogistic arguments and deductive reasoning to prove something. For example,
All men are mortal.Socrates is a man.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
This seems to work well, though Boole wanted to help it a bit by adding truth values to logic, such as “False”, “True”, “and”, “or,”, “some”, and, “all”. Thereby removing some ambiguity to logical arguments that can arise and making logical arguments more similar to the way algebra describes numerical operators.
Next came Georg Cantor (1845–1918), a German mathematician who pioneered Set Theory, now a central part of Computer Science and the cornerstone of modern mathematics. As the name suggests, Set Theory studies collections of objects. It’s extremely difficult to explain the significance of Set Theory, especially because the idea of objects and numbers being a collection of sets seems nothing more than stupidly obvious. That, paired with the fact that Set Theory is actually incredibly dense and complicated, makes it challenging to explain Cantor’s contribution. Because I can’t even quite find a good way to explain it simply, I’ve asked my good friend ChatGPT to help simply explain Set Theory:
{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …}
The order in which the elements of a set are listed is not important, and repeated elements are not allowed. For example, the set {1, 2, 3, 4} is the same as the set {4, 3, 2, 1}, but it is different from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 4}. There are different types of sets, such as finite sets (sets with a finite number of elements), infinite sets (sets with an infinite number of elements), and empty sets (sets with no elements). Set Theory is the foundation of mathematics and is used in many different areas of study, including algebra, geometry, and topology.
In Set Theory, there are also various operations that can be performed on sets, such as union, intersection, and difference. The union of two sets is a set that contains all the elements of both sets. The intersection of two sets is a set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets. The difference of two sets is a set that contains the elements that are in one set but not in the other.
There are also several axioms, or fundamental principles, of Set Theory that are used to define the properties of sets and the operations that can be performed on them.
Keep in mind, that was me asking to explain Set Theory in simple terms. Along with rebuilding a major cornerstone of math, Cantor’s work on Set Theory set the stage for database structure and query languages, such as SQL.
If Boole and Cantor were the ones who began prepping the pieces for modern-day logic, math, and computer science, Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) was the master logician who put the puzzle together. Frege took the work of Boole and Cantor and pushed it forward to completely rewrite logic altogether, coming up with what’s known as first-order logic.
What first-order logic does is replace the syllogistic forms of logic altogether with quantifiable ones, using Boolean operators and Set Theory to make an argument. So instead of the argument,
All men are mortal.Socrates is a man.Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
First-order logic would say,
“There exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man”, Where “there exists” is a quantifier and “x” is a variable.
And because we can think of elements or objects as existing within a set, the predicates, “is a man” and “is a male Homo Sapien” can both be assigned to the same set, x, which eradicates many problems that Aristotelian logic would not have been able to withstand.
Additionally, while not a philosophical contribution, per se, Frege worked with and introduced heavy-weight philosophers Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951), who had lasting influences in the world of philosophy, logic, language, mathematics, and by extension, Computer Science. To take an example, these two philosophers worked to create a logically ideal language—one that is rooted in mathematics and logic and would not be misled by mistakes made in natural language. Arguably, this is the same reason we call JavaScript, Python, C#, and the rest of them, languages.
To take it full circle, in 1937, a student by the name of Claude Shannon (1916–2001) wrote a thesis called “A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits,” using a lot of the work that Boole had put forward, which until then had no practical applications. Shannon realized he could create switching circuits based on Boolean operators, such as True (1) and False (0), now commonplace in the world of programming and computing.
Of course, there were also many other people that played a large role in making modern-day computing into a reality, too many that could be listed here. However, many of the ideas that Computer Science is based on can be directly traced back to philosophers like Boole, Cantor, Frege, Russel, and Wittenstein (as well as several others), who spent their life rebuilding logic and mathematics from the ground up. So the next time you hear someone say that philosophy is useless, remember that devices, websites, and applications we take for granted today would not exist had it not been for philosophers!

Four Things Parenting Can Teach You About Testing in the World of Development
In the world of development, things move pretty fast and are constantly changing. I used to think I had a pretty good understanding of what “go with the flow” meant, especially when testing in the development world!
My wife and I recently had our first child. You may already be smiling if you have had kids or have spent an extended time with a newborn! With the few minutes that are starting to creep back into our lives, I realize how much my day-to-day work has really helped prepare me for life at home with a newborn. Who knew that raising a newborn and testing in the dev world would have so much in common?!
I am sure there are many more ways, but here are four that stood out to me:
The dev site can sometimes be a bit like the wild wild west. Every time you head in there, you never know what you are going to get. Kind of like changing those first few diapers; you open it up and have to be ready for whatever you may find. Most likely, it will not be what you were expecting!
You feel confident that everything is ready to go, right? We do everything we can to get every detail into our stories, so the developers and testers are prepared to do what they do best. Before a baby is born, especially with your first, there is a ton of prep that happens with setting up the house, reading books, etc. Luckily at the hospital, there are plenty of people to help guide you those first few days, but all of a sudden, they are like, “See you later and good luck” Wait…what do I do now?!? Your planning will help those first few days, but then you really have to embrace going with the flow as you navigate this new adventure.
Automated Testing is used frequently to help us out, and these tests are great as they test exactly what you want. However, can you really cover everything with those tests?!? Very quickly, as a new parent, you learn that if your newborn is upset, you need to change their diapers, feed them, snuggle them, or rock or walk them. All part of that initial plan. After all that, they still keep crying. Now what?!? Just like our automated testing, it is great to help you get started, but in the end, you still need to get creative and adapt on the fly to make when the initial plan only gets you so far!
As consistent as time is, your perception of time will change very quickly with a newborn. By the time you get them up, feed them, change them, spend some quality time with them, and finally get them down for a nap, you will wonder what happened to half of your day! Looking at the clock, it is already noon, and now you must repeat that whole cycle 10 minutes from now. The same applies to both developers and testers. You can get laser-focused on bug reproduction or troubleshooting a story; the next thing you know, the entire day is gone. In the end, 8 hours is still 8 hours, but when working with a newborn or in development, that 8 hours can go by quickly!
It’s amazing how you can start to see your work in everyday tasks and everyday tasks in your work. The type of passion that influences your day-to-day much more than a paycheck. Passion is a trait that has always fit in well here at BizStream. As a tester, we try to control and standardize the development environment as much as we can with testing environments, automated testing, test plans, and test cases. Kids can come into your life and change how everything works in a good way, whether you like it or not! In the end, with kids or in the world of development, you have to adapt and master the fine art of “going with the flow.”

Building Carousels With Swiper
Carousels, also known as sliders or slideshows, are highly requested design elements on many websites. They allow users to see multiple pieces of content in a single, compact space. This blog post will explore the creation of a simple, reactive, and effective carousel using the Swiper.js library and some best practices for writing JavaScript.
Swiper is a popular and well-maintained library for creating carousels and other touch-based sliders. It has several features that make it an ideal choice for creating a carousel, including:
To use Swiper.js to create a carousel, you have two options for using the library:
First, if you plan on isolating your carousel code into a .js file, then install the Swiper library into your project with Node Package Manager:
You can see how to use this installed package later in this tutorial in the Custom Example implementation section.
Alternatively, if you would like to serve the Swiper library from a CDN in your HTML file, you can use the following initialization code to import the required styles and JavaScript. Then, insert your Swiper initialization code and specify your desired options.
With your Swiper object now initialized, you can create a carousel by adding a <div> element with the class “swiper-container” to your HTML. Here is an example of how you might build the rest of a simple carousel:
Inside the “swiper-container” <div> element, we add another <div> element with the class swiper-wrapper to wrap the group of slides. We then add a <div> element with the class swiper-slide for each slide in the carousel. From here, it’s up to you what goes in them!
Next, we add two additional <div> elements to hold the pagination and navigation buttons (optional). We specify these elements using the pagination and navigation options when we create a new Swiper instance using the Swiper constructor.
A plethora of customizations are available for your Swiper instance. These range from changing the number of shown slides to modifying the class names for wrapper HTML elements. For more information on instance-specific customizability, check out the Swiper API documentation here:
Swiper API Documentation
When working with Swiper.js or any other JavaScript library, it is necessary as a modern developer to follow best practices to ensure that your code is maintainable, efficient, and easily approachable. Here are a few tips for writing clean and effective JavaScript:
We have seen basic Swiper code and taken a look at JavaScript best practices. Now let us take a quick look at a complex carousel implementation: a timeline web component. Here is a short gif demonstrating a client-requested timeline with full functionality:
As you can see, Swiper works effectively for any project requiring a responsive moving window of slides or cards. Additionally, most of the work behind creating this timeline was the styling portion and interfacing links with Modaal, another JavaScript library that creates the modal functionality seen in the gif above. Here is the custom element Swiper initialization code used for this production-ready timeline:
Since we are using custom elements, we can now define a timeline anywhere in our HTML simply:
As you can see, even in complex situations, the Swiper library is easy to use. It requires minimal JavaScript, so you can focus more on styling your sliding web components than dealing with daunting vanilla JavaScript. As an aside, you may notice that I did not include the code for the lightbox/modal functionality highlighted in the gif. This was done to simplify our code sample and isolate timeline-specific functionality.
Before using Swiper on your own, ensure you have the API documentation ready; it will be of much help paired with the examples above. Best of luck in your Swiper adventures, and godspeed!

How to Simplify Form Field Validations in Kentico
Data Annotations for validations are an easy way to create a validation that can be used for multiple fields or properties quickly. It can save time and keep code cleaner to do validations on data using these Data Annotations.
These Data Annotations are Decorations that look like tags for methods, fields, and properties. Some commonly used Decorations for fields and properties are [Required], [MaxLength], and [MinLength]. Decorations aren’t limited to just fields or properties, they can also be used on methods. This is commonly seen in controllers such as [HttpPost], [HttpGet], [Authorize], and [ValidateAntiforgeryToken]. Even the class for an API controller may be decorated with the [Route] attribute to specify how the controller and its methods should be found.
Sometimes, we need to validate a field in a way that isn’t handled out of the box, or sometimes we just want a little more control over the messages from the validation. There are plenty of reasons to create a custom validation, and they aren’t all that scary. Let’s say for password validation, there are four different requirements:
This can be handled with a single Regex, but the error message for each part of the validation will not let the user know exactly which requirement was not met. However, the Regex Data Annotation only allows one instance per field/property, so it’s not possible to add one for each individual error message.
We have a couple of different solutions here; we could create a validation attribute for a custom regex validation that allows multiple attributes to be applied to a single field or create a custom attribute that contains the regex already but returns the error message for each regex condition if it does not exist. I prefer the latter, as modifying this later will be easier if the validation requirements change. Since the Regex validation is done in the data annotation logic, only the attribute would need to be modified to update the password validation for any password using this attribute. Creating an attribute that takes in a regex validation and allows multiple would be helpful in places where there may be a need to have different Regex validations, likely for something that is not a password.
Before I create the attribute, I want to separate the validation itself. This way, if there is any reason to do a password validation outside of the attribute itself, it can be called on any string as an extension. This will go in a PasswordValidationExtension in the same location as other extensions for the project. For each of the error messages, I am going to be using Kentico resource strings so they are easy to maintain if the site owners ever want to change them.
With the logic for the password validation out of the way, the attribute can be created to be used for the password validation. To make a class usable as an attribute, that class needs to inherit from the ValidationAttribute class. Then add the AttributeUsage attribute, and the types it will target. Attributes can target other types as well, including methods. This can be used to describe the method or prevent execution of the method, like the [ValidateAntiforgeryToken] or [AuthorizeAttribute]. Below is the PasswordValidationAttribute, which goes in a location for all custom validations in the project.
For attributes that need to be applied multiple times, add AllowMultiple=true in the AttributeUsage decoration for the class being used as an attribute. This validation does not need to be applied multiple times to the same field, but below is what it would look like for an Attribute that would.
All that’s left now is to decorate the fields needing validation with the newly created Data Annotation. That annotation then validates the field and will pass the errors to the front end if there are any. The override for IsValid tells the attribute how to validate the field or property this Data Annotation is on. This is the method that needs to be overridden with custom logic when creating any custom validation. The override for FormatErrorMessage is only needed if the message will need to be formatted. The ErrorMessage property is inherited from the ValidationAttribute class, so setting this field on validation without overriding the FormatErrorMessage method will still work if you wish to define the error message in the Attribute itself.
Any property with a Data Annotation will be validated automatically when a form is submitted with this property. Any errors that are caught in validation will invalidate the model state, allowing us to stop the submission before any other logic is run. We can then return the same view to the user, and the model state will contain the error messages needed to let the user know which form fields need attention. Now, a password can not be submitted into a form without having the four requirements from earlier. If any requirement is missing, the form is returned with a custom error message letting the user know which requirement their password did not meet.
This process can be used to validate any property. Change the name of the data annotation, change the logic for the validation, define the error message, and apply it to a property. Using a custom Data Annotation allows us to cover validations that are unique to an application. In this scenario, the validation could have been handled through a single Regex, but I needed more control over the error messages. With this validation, I am performing the same Regex match but updating the error specifically to what requirement(s) are missing. If my password meets 2 of the four requirements, the two missing requirements will be displayed in the returned form. This is less confusing for the user while still being clean in the backend.

Four Ways Working in the Office Positively Affects Company Culture
When I first joined BizStream, I was shocked to see how much time and effort was poured into the company culture, or more descriptively, the office team culture. I have worked at several small businesses as a Sales Rep, manager, and Vice President, but I have never felt such a strong commitment to building a business based on team effort as BizStream. I, unfortunately, realize now that I may not have fully understood how to create and implement a strong team culture when I had the opportunity in the past.
Team culture is a major factor in running a successful business. In this post-pandemic world, it is more important than ever to have the right people on board to achieve the company goals and to surround yourself to accomplish your own personal goals. To put it bluntly, I feel the best compliment to cultural success is having your team in the office working together more days than not.
Here are a few points that I feel help build a thriving team culture and a successful business:
In short, I do believe that having a team-oriented culture that works mostly in-office is the best strategy for success, both professionally and personally. Of course, there are some opportunities to create great company cultures that don’t rely on face-to-face interactions. But as a people person, the team mentality will always win in my book.

Why and How to Design for Accessibility
When creating custom website designs, it’s essential to make sure that the aesthetic and functional design choices made are as inclusive of all website users as possible. Doing so will make the website better for everyone.
Users of websites and online tools are often very different in age, education, cultural background, and more. They have different levels of experience with computers and mobile devices and often have different physical characteristics that affect how they interact with technology (color blindness, physical handicap, etc.). But at the end of the day, they just want to complete their intended action on the website and be on their way. This core similarity is what designing for accessibility is all about. Making websites easier for all users to access the information they’re looking for.
Designs are always created within a set of constraints; client needs, budget, timeline, scope, etc. Accessibility issues are just an additional set of constraints that need to be considered while creating a design. Many designers working with accessibility constraints for the first time may think that these constraints will make their designs less interesting, cluttered, or dull. This is not the case. Accessibility constraints instead lead to more creative and effective solutions that are a better experience for all of your users.
There are a variety of accessibility issues that may affect users of your website. Some key accessibility issues to consider while making design decisions include:
In addition, accessibility issues may not always be permanent. Users may have permanent, temporary, or situational accessibility issues. Microsoft has a handy inclusive design toolkit that highlights how inclusive design can benefit users. Included within is a helpful table about different types of temporary and permanent accessibility issues (shown below).
Remember, making your website or app more accessible makes it more useful for everyone. Making things easier for your users builds trust in your brand, leads to greater customer satisfaction, and higher conversions.
We can help you make your next web project more accessible and inclusive, leading to increased growth and profitability. Contact us today.

Essential Web Dev Accessibility Resources
If you are just beginning to learn about web accessibility, then you have landed in the right place. This article will not teach you how to develop accessible websites, which is far beyond the scope of just one blog post, but the goal is to outline some of the core web accessibility resources available. Even if you are already familiar with web accessibility, my hopes are that you will still find some valuable resources in this article that will help you develop accessible websites and/or test your websites to ensure they are accessible. Let’s dive in!
The World Wide Web Consortium has a ton of information on web accessibility, as they are the international community that develops the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG. The WCAG is currently in version 2.1, with version 2.2 in draft. The goal of the WCAG is to provide “a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally,” and it explains how to make web content accessible. So, when trying to find out how to make content on your website accessible, the WCAG is the source of truth. The guidelines in the WCAG have testable success criteria, which are used by accessibility experts and testing tools. Being familiar with the WCAG and knowing how to find the success criteria for these guidelines is of great importance when it comes to web accessibility, which brings us to the first and probably most important resource, the WCAG Quick Reference. The WCAG Quick Reference provides information to aid in understanding each guideline, as well as sufficient techniques to fulfill the success criteria of each guideline. You can also filter by the three levels of success criteria, which is very handy for narrowing down the guidelines based on the level you are trying to pass.
Another really useful resource is the W3C tutorials page. On this page, they have tutorials, with code examples, on how to develop various web content that is accessible. The tutorials include page structure, menus, images, tables, forms, and carousels. Within the tutorials, the W3C includes links back to the related Success Criteria of the WCAG, which helps to understand exactly why each component needs to be developed in a particular way.
While testing tools cannot catch everything on a web page that isn’t accessible, they are a good first step and the first line of defense to catch any web content that isn’t accessible, for example, an image tag that doesn’t have an alt attribute.
Lighthouse is a built-in tool in the Chrome dev tools. If you navigate to a web page you want to test, open up the developer tools (right-click and select “inspect”), and select the Lighthouse tab. Lighthouse has many different tests that can be run, but for our purposes, we are interested in the Accessibility report.
Clicking the “Analyze page load” will reload the page. Once the page has finished loading, Lighthouse generates an accessibility report. It will give the page an accessibility score as well as a list of suggestion that points to the HTML element in question.
Another useful tool similar to Lighthouse is the axe DevTools Chrome extension. The free version does virtually the same thing as Lighthouse, which will scan a page and point out the HTML element(s) that don’t pass particular WCAG success criteria. The paid version is much more robust and allows you to run Guided Tests that will allow you to test things like keyboard functionality and interactive elements.
Like I mentioned above, these testing tools are great first lines of defense, but they cannot catch everything due to the various ways that web content can be developed. Therefore, having a web accessibility specialist audit your site is the best way to ensure the web content of your site uses sufficient techniques to meet the success criteria of the WCAG.

Question Everything
Question Everything, even if it represents generations of conventional wisdom.
When the global pandemic made its debut in early March of 2020, no one could have predicted what kind of profound impact it would have on the workplace. What started as a two-week initiative to “slow the curve” turned into a prolonged experiment in working remotely and somehow still attempting to balance the metaphorical work/life scales. Many businesses couldn’t adapt to this change and closed up shop soon after the lockdown was initiated, while others seemed to thrive.I’m not going to paint the lockdown in a positive light. It was brutal for all of us. Especially for BizStream, where we pride ourselves on our unique and “Nationally recognized” culture that includes many social gatherings, team outings, and even the occasional trip to the Bartesian (think Keurig but for alcoholic cocktails). But if I were to look at this large glass of COVID milk as half full, I recognize that we did pick up some decent habits along the way.
In hindsight, the COVID lockdown was one big forced social experiment. It took us all well out of our comfort zones. I remember gripping and grasping for a sense of normalcy as one week of lockdown turned into one month, one quarter, and eventually one full year. We weren’t really given a choice. You either adapt, or you wallow in self-pity. When you are forced into change, a lot of good can come out of it. We began to realize that work can still happen remotely. That a company is not defined by a brick-and-mortar building but by an amalgamation of people working together through trust building teams. We found new platforms for social engagement. New ways of approaching workloads and even better creative ways of praising each other for the work we are so humbly proud of. But above all, it taught us the importance of challenging societal norms both inside and outside of the workplace.
Okay, enough pandemic talk. It’s now 2022, and we are back in the office with our newfound knowledge, which extends far beyond using hand sanitizer ten times a day. Even before the pandemic, our leadership at BizStream would often remind us to question everything. Question our processes. Our tech stacks. Question why we work five day work weeks.. As a collaborative unit, we are encouraged to ask questions, challenge “standards,” and bring new ideas to the table. Don’t complain just to complain. That hinders progress, and you will be put into the cone of shame..
This is not a new thing for us, but quite honestly, we weren’t very good at it up until recently. Shortly after our teams began funneling back into the office, we carried with us a new sense of urgency to challenge the status quo and embrace change. We learned through 2020 and 2021 that life is too damn short not to try new things.
We used to host a monthly event called “Lab Day.” On the last Friday of every month, our team would work on non-client work and focus on either learning something new or building a “Shippable” product by the end of the day. It was a good idea in theory, and the event had been around since I started at BizStream back in 2016, so naturally, it was here to stay… Right?
I had started to notice a trend where many developers were choosing to utilize this day to catch up on client work. But why? What had happened to this “coveted” monthly perk? We tried other ways to rejuvenate this “historical artifact” of an event, but it just wasn’t working. I decided to send out a Google Poll to the entire team to get a sense of how people felt about it, and the results were pretty conclusive. Just as Harrison Ford desperately grasped for the holy grail as it teetered on the edge of oblivion, Sean Connery looked lovingly into our eyes and smiled down from heaven as he said, “Let it Go.”
So that’s what we did. A little self-examination goes a long way, folks. We put the pause on lab day, which forced our collective group to think about how we could repurpose this perk into something a little more useful.
Over the last year, we had been hearing a lot of reports on companies experimenting with the four-day workweek. In hindsight, it seemed to be fate that BizStream was primed for this specific experiment. We had just determined that lab days were on their way out, AND we knew from our COVID experience that we had ironed out a lot of the inefficiencies and quirks associated with remote work. The foundation was set.It seemed very doable. It would not be met without some challenges, of course, but that wasn’t the point. We wanted to try something new. We challenged not only ourselves but societal norms about the “American five-day workweek.”For the first time in BizStream history, we closed up shop every Friday for the months of June, July, and August in 2022. Now I won’t sugarcoat the end results. The perks were easy to observe right out the gate, but we also discovered many unique challenges that tested our management team in new ways, but that’s not really the point of this post. We examined an issue, questioned the status quo, and put forth a new experiment that would challenge the norm. We were successful in that, and we learned so much along the way.
Life is too short to go through the motions. What makes working with and for BizStream is that it’s full of like-minded individuals who love to try new things. Some of our experiments fail. Most succeed. We push ourselves with exciting new tech stacks, agile methodologies, four-day work weeks, and cocktails that we make up on the spot. Just another day in the life of a BizStreamer.
"An unexamined life is not worth living."

Brian McKeiver Speaking at Microsoft Ignite 2022
Join Brian McKeiver, BizStream’s co-owner and Microsoft Azure MVP, at Microsoft Ignite on Wednesday, October 12, 2022!
We all know that providing a good search experience for website visitors is hard. Everyone expects it to “just” work like Google or Amazon. Maybe there is a better way, maybe we fix this with a little help from some AI.
Join the session to see how you can leverage Cognitive Services with Azure Cognitive Search in your apps. With the newly minted semantic search abilities, this technology can provide results that are semantically closer to the intent of the original query. For example, can your search return the right results for a query like “in the last 5 years,” or will it just return matches based on those 5 words without any context?
You will also learn how to enhance and enrich search through Cognitive Service Skills like natural language processing, image analysis, and entity recognition capabilities. Don’t know what those are? Well, that’s not a problem because you will find out.
You can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes. Why not use the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that Bing and Office have used for more than a decade into your site? Maybe AI can make it “just” work.
Brian will also demonstrate how having a Headless CMS, like Kontent.ai, to source search index data is a powerful combination when it comes to search experience on your website.
Wednesday, October 123:00 PM – 3:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time
In-person tickets are sold out for the event at the Seattle Conference Center, but you can still join us online. Register for Microsoft Ignite online at any time, as it is a global event.
Brian McKeiver is Co-Owner at BizStream, a digital agency in Allendale, MI. At BizStream, he is a solution architect, visionary, Microsoft Azure MVP, Kentico Xperience MVP, and Kentico Kontent MVP. He has over 19 years of experience leading his agency of more than 30 employees, about a hundred clients spread out across North America, and one heck of an interesting story of how it all started from a two-person team.

Figma + Adobe and the Future of UX Design Tools
In September of 2022, Adobe announced its intent to acquire the popular UX design application, Figma. This sent shockwaves throughout the design community, and many of us are very curious to see how these two design powerhouses come together.
Adobe has been the primary provider of industry standard design software for decades; Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, XD, After Effects, and many more. There are a variety of competitors out there, but no single competitor has the breadth of product offering, large user base, or intercompatibility that Adobe and its products have.
But then there’s Figma. Over the last several years, Figma has grown to be a hugely popular UX design program. So much so that many agencies and designers have switched to using Figma entirely for their web, product, and graphic design needs. I myself was a latecomer to Figma and its wonderful qualities, but I’m glad I came around when I did.
Adobe’s primary competing product, XD, does many of the same things Figma does. But most of those things Figma does better and more seamlessly. Many users of Figma were proud of the fact that it was an independent product, not made by Adobe. So that there was more competition and innovation in the design software space. To me, this is the single most important aspect of the whole deal. Many of the innovations and features of the Figma application were only possible because it was created outside of the Adobe ecosystem. Many of these features had been requested by users in Adobe’s apps for years with little to no progress from Adobe.
Adobe made the initial announcement with a blog post and a press release. Figma also announced the acquisition on its blog. This deal is huge news. Not only is Adobe buying one of the most popular independent software developers, but they are willing to pay an incredible amount for it, “approximately $20 billion in cash and stock.” Whoa. That’s almost five times what Disney paid to acquire all of Lucasfilm; Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Industrial Light & Magic, and so much more… granted, that deal was in 2012. But to put that into perspective, Figma didn’t even release its closed beta until 2015. So, in just about seven years, Figma was able to grow its valuation to five times that of Lucasfilm. No matter how you look at it, $20 billion is an insane amount of money.
What’s next for Adobe and Figma? Only they know right now. As of this writing, the deal hasn’t officially closed, and Adobe and Figma haven’t announced specifics for how their tools will be integrated together. (Will Figma and XD merge into one program? Which features of each program will be kept, and which will be removed?) The obvious hope is that the strongest features of each tool will be combined to make a superior product to what each was on its own.
At this point, I choose to be optimistic. Having a set of design applications that all work well together is really handy when working on large design projects. By bringing Figma into Creative Cloud, Adobe makes its suite of design tools even stronger. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I’ve found Figma’s implementation of features more in line with what users ask for and more timely to the needs of the design community. Above all, I hope that Figma’s spirit of innovation isn’t lost in the merger. I don’t think Adobe would invest $20 billion into a product just to squander all of its current and future potential.
As creatives, we use our preferred design tools every day. We rely on them and put a lot of trust in them. So, when they change, it can be jarring. But we adapt; that’s what we do. Let’s hope Adobe’s purchase of Figma turns out to be an overall positive for the design community.
Check out projects we’ve created with Adobe and Figma’s tools.

Kentico Page Builder Section: One to Rule Them All (Variable Section)
Iterating upon one of my previous blog posts about complex sections and widgets has put me on an unexpected journey to build one Page Builder section to rule them all. One section for almost every layout a content administrator could ask for. I’m utilizing Kentico 13’s property visibility conditions to only show the properties that content admins need to see.
The Generic Column Section was a good starting point. One section that allows up to five columns with equal widths. An initial improvement I made to this section was adding an option to allow a sixth column.
I made another section to handle any percentage of two-column layouts. This section replaced the need for 30/70, 40/60, 50/50, or any other combination of two columns. As long as the content admin configures the column widths to be at or below 100%, then everything will look good.
In my head, I wanted to make a three-column adjustable section similar to the two-column one. With those three sections, I think most layouts would be covered.
After upgrading a client’s site to K13 they wanted to start utilizing page builder. Their first request was to make one section that handled the previously three mentioned sections and even more features all in one section. They wanted each column to have its own border styles, padding, and text color properties. Initially, I was hesitant to the request because the sheer amount of properties on this section would be overwhelming to content admins. I suggested breaking this into three sections, but they were adamant about keeping everything in one.
With the acceptance criteria defined, I set forth on my journey to forge them the section they desired. I began with defining all the properties in the VariableSectionProperties.cs class.
I leveraged the Builder Visibility Conditions to ensure only the required properties display based on the ColumnCount dropdown. For example, when the user selects 2-3 columns, those columns will have a width property displaying, but when a user selects 4 or above, the custom visibility conditions tell those width properties they shall not pass, hiding them. 4-6 columns are all equal-width columns based on the client’s request.
The BaseSectionProperties is where I put properties that are shared across any section I build. Properties like margin, padding, IsFullBleed, and background color are in this file.
The custom visibility condition uses a range value to display properties. The DependeePropertyValue is the ColumnCount property value. As content admins update the ColumnCount the properties will update dynamically.
Rendering the section is about as easy as Frodo’s quest would’ve been if Gandalf called upon the Eagles from the beginning. I removed bootstrap from the Generic Column Section I started with. Now we’re using flexbox with custom classes to be able to override the default column widths easier.
In the stylesheet for the variable section, we’re utilizing media queries to set an override for mobile styling. The 1-3 column(s) are stacking and having their width set to 100%, and the 4-6 columns are stacking in a two-column layout.
I think this variable section is a great foundation to keep iterating on for years to come. I have a few thoughts on how to expand the functionality of this section. One of the features I would like to add is a IsAccordion boolean to the section and each column in the section.I also plan to add this section to the Kentico Marketplace and GitHub. I’ll probably look into doing this after adding the additional features.

Timer Triggered Azure Functions in C# with .NET 6
So, first, let’s set the stage. At BizStream, we have a Pulse meeting with the entire group every Monday morning. It’s a general review of the company’s heartbeat, and one of the topics covered in this meeting is who is out of the office. This conversation is a general overview of who is on PTO that week or the following Monday. This is useful to get a glance at the week in general. However, things change after Monday. Or sometimes, I just don’t remember all the names from the Pulse meeting.
I thought – “it’d be nice to be able to pull up Slack and see a daily message of who is on PTO for a given day.” So, that’s what I made. We will walk through creating and deploying a timer-triggered Azure Function that accomplishes just this. We will walk through using a Key Vault to store the secrets needed for the API calls in a secure manner, and then we will cover remote debugging of your newly created Azure Function App.
In this post, we will not be covering gathering data using the REST API from TMetric or creating a Slack app for sending a message to a channel – which I did via a webhook URL for the Slack app. I also used RestSharp and Newtonsoft.Json for data consumption. You could consume any API for data you’d like and create a Slack message out of it if you aren’t sure what might be useful for you.
Before you get started, make sure you have the following requirements in place:
You also need an Azure account with an active subscription. Create an account for free.
We will first need to create a Resource Group in Azure. Search for Resource Groups and select Resource groups from the results. On the Resource groups page, click Create.
Select your subscription and type in a name for the resource group, I named mine PTO, but you can call it what you’d like. Choose a Region, typically the one that is closest to your current time zone.
Next, we need to create a Storage Account. You can follow the same process of searching for Storage Accounts, clicking on it, and selecting Create. The same subscription is most likely pre-selected but verify the correct subscription is selected. You will want to choose the resource group that we just created in the last step. Type in any name that you would like. You want to select the same region you set for your resource group. Standard Performance will work for this use case. Since this isn’t an important application, you’ll want to change the Redundancy to Locally-redundant storage (LRS).
Let’s head back to the search bar, type in Function App, and select it. Click create and fill in the details. Select the same subscription and resource group as before—type in a name for your Function App. We will be using .NET 6 and deploying to the same region we were using before. It will be a Windows OS, and the Plan type is Consumption (Serverless).
Click Next: Hosting and select the storage account that was just created in the previous step. Click Next: Networking and Next: Monitoring (or use the tabbed navigation to go to Monitoring). On the Monitoring tab, select No for Enable Application Insights. Now you can select Review + Create.
After it is created and the deployment has finished successfully, click on the Go to resource button. Once the resource page has loaded and you see the Overview section, identify the heading Functions, select Functions on the left navigation, and click on it.
Let’s open VS Code and do a little Azure from there, shall we?
In your new window of VS Code, go to the Azure tab on the left-hand navigation – assuming the Azure tools extension has been installed. In VS Code, you’ll also need to be signed in to your Microsoft Azure account with the subscription to the resource group and storage account we created in the previous steps.
To sign in, you can press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette in VS Code, start typing Azure Sign in, and select the option. You should also see an option to sign in under the Azure panel, which we will get to in the next step.
Choose the Azure icon in the Activity bar. In the Azure panel, under Workspace, click the plus button and select Create Function.
You shouldn’t have any projects listed here yet; there will be a pop-up asking you to create or open an existing project – select Create new project.
Select a location where you’d like to store the project locally. VS Code will then walk you through creating the Function locally so you can code from VS Code (or Visual Studio, more on that later). In the command palette, select C#.
Continue selecting the following options as you create the project:
After entering the cron expression, it will ask to select a storage account for debugging and internal use. You can emulate a local instance or select an existing storage account. In this scenario, you will select the storage account we created earlier. In the command palette, choose the subscription under which you created the storage account, and then select the storage account. Open the new project in the current window.
Once the project is created and opened, you may be missing some necessary dependencies. There should be a notification from VS Code saying there are unresolved dependencies. Click Restore.
You can install the dependencies manually if you don’t get the notification. To do so, run a dotnet add package command in the terminal. Or, if you have the NuGet Package Manager GUI extension installed in VS Code, you can also install it with that tool.
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs –version 3.0.33
Your new timer trigger function is ready for editing. The template should look something like this:
At this point, I already had a console application with working code for my TMetric and Slack calls. I recreated the classes and services in the newly created Function App.
The models I have mainly represent the JSON objects I am getting back from TMetric. After getting the data for who is on PTO today, I then build an appropriate string to send to the Slack webhook URL.
You will want to store your keys and secrets in the local.settings.json file for local development purposes. To read these values, you will want to use the Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(string variable) method. Below is the code from my Slack Service to get the webhook URL’s value.
Use this to store and access any secrets you need for your API calls for testing locally. When we are ready for testing, it’s easy to debug locally. Open Run from the menu and select Start Debugging (or press F5).
However, you’ll not want to track your local.settings.json in Git or publish them to Azure. You might be wondering; how do we securely store and access our secrets in our Azure Function App when deployed?
Azure has an excellent tool for solving this problem, and that is using a Key Vault. Before creating the Key Vault, we must enable system-assigned managed identity for our Function App.Let’s head back to Azure for a little bit to do that. Navigate to the Function App. Under Settings, click on Identity.
On the Identity blade, under the System assigned tab, change the Status to On and click Save. The system will generate an identity for you – click Yes on the subsequent popup asking to assign the managed identity.
Now that we have an identity to provide permissions, we need to make a Key Vault. In the search bar, type Key Vaults and select it from the results. On the Key Vaults page, click on Create.
On the Create a Key Vault blade, select the subscription and resource group that you’ve been using. Enter a name for the key vault. Use the same region your other resources have used and leave the pricing tier set to Standard.
Click Next: Access Policy and then click Add Access Policy.
You can leave the template drop-down blank on the Add Access Policy blade. Add Secret permissions for Get and List. Open the selection for Principal and search for the name of your Function App. Click on the name of the Function App and then click the Select button towards the bottom. Then click Add.
After that, we are ready to Review + create. After the creation and deployment of the key vault are complete, go to the resource. In the left navigation, under Settings, click on Secrets.
On the Secrets blade, generate as many as needed for the keys and secrets your Function App needs. After creating each, you want to click on the secret version, copy the Secret Identifier, and paste it into Notepad. You’ll need these in a moment.
Now that we have our key vault with our secrets and permission to access the Function App, we need to create the application settings that correspond to those secrets in the Function App. Go to the Function App and click on Configuration under Settings in the left navigation menu. Under Application Settings, click on New application setting.
Name these settings the same as what you named your settings in your local.settings.json so that your environment variable names don’t need to change in your function code. The value will be @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=<the-secret-identifier-link>) where the <the-secret-identifier-link> should be replaced with the corresponding identifiers you copied into Notepad.
Once these have been entered, save the settings before leaving the page.
While we are here entering settings, there is another setting we should add for our timer trigger to occur when we expect it to. By default, serverless Azure Function Apps that use timer triggers will use UTC. We need to add another setting, WEBSITE_TIME_ZONE, if we want more control. I am on Eastern Standard Time, although you can find the list of time zones here. Make sure to save the application settings again.
It’s time to put together the timer trigger function. The framework was created already, but we need to clean out the Run method.
Next, you will want to put together the logic that makes sense for the type of message you are creating (if you are putting together a similar app). Below is my Run method.
I want to point out that I have updated my method to an async method and the return type of Task. I am running some async methods for the API calls and Azure Blob storage integrated into the function.
Now that you are ready to deploy something working, go ahead and deploy it to the Function App we created earlier. In VS Code, open the Azure panel again. Under Workspace, click the Deploy button and select Deploy to Function App.
The command palette will pop up. Make sure to select your subscription where you’ve created your Resource Group and Storage Account, and then you will select the Function App you want to deploy to. After your selections, you will need to confirm the deployment, as it will overwrite any previous deployment and cannot be undone.
The output of the process will be shown in the terminal in VS Code. Let’s look at the function in Azure. Go to the Function App that we deployed to. Click on Functions in the left-side navigation, and you should see the timer trigger function you created and deployed.
Depending on the time you set for the cron expression in your trigger, you may want to test your function but not wait for it to execute. Click on the function name and then click on Code + Test on the function blade under the Developer section. On the Code + Test blade, click the Test/Run button to open another blade to the right. You can click run here to execute your function whenever you’d like.
If you experience issues or things do not work as they did locally during your testing, you may want to do some remote debugging. There are a few ways to debug your function remotely, but I will show you what I have personally found as the easiest way to debug. You’ll need Visual Studio 2022 for this technique.
To use VS2022 to debug remotely, you will need to ensure the Azure development features are installed. If you are freshly installing VS2022, you can select Azure development during the installation. If you already have VS2022 installed, you can modify your installation by going to Tools > Get Tools and Features, checking Azure development, and clicking Install while downloading.
After ensuring you have the Azure SDKs, click File > Open > Project/Solution and select the project file in your function’s repository on your local system. This will create a solution file for you, so you can easily open the project in VS Code or Visual Studio if you have a preference.In the file menu, click on Build and select Publish.
There will be a Publish pop-up asking you where you want to publish. Click on Azure for the Target and select Azure Function App (Windows) for the Specific Target.
Next, you will need to sign into your Azure account. Then, on the Functions instance, leave View as Resource Group. Under Function Apps, expand the Resource Group and select the Function App you created and published from VS Code. Then click Finish.Now you have a Publish profile synced with your Azure subscription and the Function App you want to remote debug. On the Publish window, to hit breakpoints, you will need to adjust the publish from Release to Debug. You can edit the configuration by clicking the pencil and changing the Configuration to Debug.
After saving the configuration, go ahead and click the Publish button. You will see the logs of the publish populate the Output window. You will see a successful message upon completion.
Now you are ready to start a remote debugging session. To do this, under the Hosting group, click the ellipses (…) and select Attached debugger.
Visual Studio will do the work of attaching to the Function App in Azure and allows you to debug from within the deployment environment. It may take a moment before it connects, but you can set breakpoints where necessary to debug your application.If you get the error that the Azure resource is not available, then you most likely need to go to Account settings in VS 2022 and sign back into your Azure account.
That was a basic approach to creating a timer triggered Function App in Azure. There are additional types of triggers, and you can create much more elaborate functions and workflows to accomplish business tasks. For example, you could use a Blob trigger to process invoices from your e-commerce website into another system, such as an ERP system. Functions are great ways to offload unnecessary overhead with your applications.

BizStream Celebrated 21 Years With a Carnival-Themed Birthday Bash!
A lot has happened over the past 21 years, check it all out at BizStream’s History Timeline!
“Welcome family, friends, team members past and present, clients, and vendors!
We are excited to share this day with you all. Today is our way of saying Thank You for  being a part of our story. Since the pandemic put a hold on celebrating 20 years of being in business, we opted to wait until we turned 21. Besides, celebrating our 21st birthday, which is the legal drinking age, seemed to fit our style better anyway.
BizStream started as an idea to build a place where people actually want to come to work to be a part of something meaningful. A place where we push each other to build the best possible solution for our clients. A place where we truly care about our team and our clients’ day-to-day lives. A place where we Work Hard and Play Hard at the same time. In short, the reason we all come to work every day is to build cool stuff, with cool people, and have a positive impact on others. So, thanks again, because BizStream would not exist today without the efforts and support of each and every one of you!
It’s been 21 years in the making, so grab some food, have a few drinks, and by all means, enjoy yourself on this day of celebration! Thanks again! We appreciate you being a part of the BizStream Family. We look forward to sharing and celebrating many more years to come!”
– Mark & Brian
Thank you to all of our event vendors! They played a large part in the success of our special day!

Creating Kontent.ai Custom Elements
Kontent.ai is a robust and easy-to-use Headless Content Management System. One of the great features of Kontent.ai is its extensibility through Custom Elements. These custom elements are simply separate, self-hosted web applications that can connect to Kontent.ai using the Custom Elements JS API. This allows integration with any other system and the ability to create any type of custom editing experience as long as it can be implemented in another web application.
To demonstrate how custom elements work, we will walk through how to implement a web page that generates a random color using an external API. First, we will create a project using npm. Then we need to create a simple server to host our page. Then we will create our page and client-side code for the UI, external API integration, and connection to Kontent.ai.
We will outline the code for each step of the process as we go, but if you want to see the complete source code, it is hosted in BizStream’s GitHub repository here.
To set up a new project make sure to have Node and npm installed (or a similar package manager, like yarn). Note that setting up a project using npm is not necessary in order to have a working Kontent.ai element, but we will create one here so that we can easily install packages and host our element locally for testing using Node.
After verifying that Node is installed, run the following in the command line:
Follow the prompts or accept the defaults as desired, and a new package.json file will be generated. Here is an example of the one we generated:
For the web app and the main functionality of our Kontent.ai element, we will create a basic web page. We will also use Alpine to help us add functionality quickly for the UI.
Here is the markup, saved to index.html:
Color Name:
This simple page contains a div with the random background color, text showing a random color name, and a button we can use to fetch new random colors.
Next, we need to add the code to make the UI interactive and allow querying the cloud service for random colors.
For querying the API we will use the fetch method implemented in all modern browsers.
Now that the web app is completed, we need to be able to serve it up from a web server. As mentioned previously, we will use Node and Express, running locally, to handle this. Run npm install express –save to install Express and save it as a dependency in our project.
Here is the code we will use for our Express server, saved to the file server.js:
With both the web app and server written, the final step is to test it in Kontent.ai. Kontent.ai will show our web app in an iframe in the editor and communicate with our app using the iframe API mentioned previously. Kontent.ai also requires our app to be on a secure connection.
We can test this locally using Ngrok. Ngrok is a service that acts as a tunnel, and we can use it to point Kontent.ai to our computer and Node server running on localhost. First, enter node server.js to start our local server, then, in a separate command line instance, run ngrok HTTP localhost:8000 to get the tunnel set up:
Ngrok will then create and print a random, unique address for the tunnel. Copy the HTTPS address, which will be entered into Kontent.ai as the web location of our app.
Now we need to create a new custom element in Kontent.ai and point it to our application. To do this, first log into Kontent.ai.
To make the custom element reusable for any content type we will create a new Content Type Snippet, under the Content model section. We have named our snippet Color Randomizer.
We will then add a Custom Element field. Upon adding this field, there are a few parameters that we can enter. The Hosted code URL (HTTPS) field is where we will paste the address created by Ngrok, which we copied in the previous step. There are also two other fields, which are used for specifying other Kontent.ai element names and holding configuration data, respectively. The element names are for Kontent.ai elements that the custom element code should be given access to. The configuration data, formatted as JSON, is for other data the web app can pull in and use if needed, such as API Keys or other initialization values. We will not need those for this example, so make sure to paste the Ngrok address into the respective field, save the snippet, and go back to the main Content Model section.
Now, create a new model where our snippet and custom element will be used. We called our model Color Randomizer Demo. Add a Content Type Snippet element and select the snippet we created earlier from the drop-down.
The last and final step is to create an item that uses the custom element and see it in action. Go to the Content & Assets tab on the left, click the Create New button in the top-right corner and choose to create a new Color Randomizer Demo element.
Here we can see that we start out with no color, but then as we click the button, new colors are randomly generated and saved in Kontent.ai. If we then Publish the element, the button becomes disabled, using the callback we implemented until we create a new version.
This is a simple example of what can be created using Custom Elements inside Kontent.ai, but it is an example of the freedom that developers have to create any kind of integration and editing experience, as long as it can be implemented and hosted in a web application. This is just one of the many reasons for choosing Kontent.ai as a Headless Content Management platform.

How to Secure Your Kentico Xperience Site With Content Security Policy
So you’ve been tasked with applying CSP headers, and now you’ve landed here. Welcome! Hopefully, I can alleviate many of the problems you might run into. Perhaps you don’t know what CSP headers even are.
Recently, we at BizStream have seen an uptick in the awareness and need for Content Security Policy headers on our clients’ sites. Here, I will outline what I’ve done to solve the issue of applying CSP headers to a pre-existing site.
From MDN, Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement, to malware distribution.
In other words, it’s a way to whitelist everything that your site uses as a safe resource, such that it will reject anything else. While its purpose is to protect your site from malicious attacks, it is only your first line of defense and is not intended to be a complete solution for preventing attacks. For a more in-depth explanation of Content Security Policy, you can check out Mike West and Joe Medley’s article, An Introduction to Content Security Policy.

For a more in-depth explanation of Content Security Policy, you can check out Mike West and Joe Medley’s article, An Introduction to Content Security Policy.
Policy directives describe rules for a particular resource or policy area. For example, the following policy directive will allow content from the same domain and trusted.com, including all subdomains.
I won’t go over every available directive (there are a lot of them!). The best practice would be to set every available directive, if possible. The important ones to note are script-src and style-src. With the CSP Level 3 specification, we find a saving grace in the new strict-dynamic directive. This allows us to mark which inline scripts and styles are safe to run. Consequently, this also automatically marks scripts and styles inserted by the marked scripts as safe to run. For example, Google Tag Manager will insert analytics scripts when it initializes. If you’re wondering about what a CSP level is, it’s just the specification version. Level 3 is the latest iteration as of writing this blog post. If you’re interested in reading up, you can go directly to the source from W3.
When working with Kentico, there are quite a few hoops to jump through to ensure your site is secure. Unfortunately, to fully secure the Kentico Mother, we would need to edit the source files of Kentico. This is a big red flag for pain down the line when upgrading to the next Kentico version. Therefore, we are currently unable to secure the Kentico Mother with CSP and will need to create a bypass instead.
Amongst finding all sources for our resources to add to our CSP headers, we have a small laundry list of things we need to add for our site to function with the CSP restrictions. My example was built in .NET Framework 4.8; the same concept is possible but built differently in .NET Core. However, The concepts should still carry over.
Here’s an outline of the things we need to do in order to secure our site:
First, we can create the HtmlOutputFilter base class that our other filters will inherit in order to share the ability to parse and edit the HtmlOutput of our controllers.
Next, we can build out our two filters to add nonces and remove the inline onsubmit event handlers.
On the topic of nonces, I should probably explain what these are a little. Nonces are a one-time use value. For CSP headers, we supply a nonce to the headers themselves and also add a nonce attribute to each inline script and style tag on our page. This way, the browser knows which inline elements to trust. If we were to statically define our nonces, they would be meaningless. An attacker could simply look at the nonce value, add it to their scripts, and inject their malicious scripts on the next request. What we are doing is using NWebsec to dynamically generate a nonce per request. That way, an attacker does not have a way to know the nonce beforehand.
We will also create a conditional filter that only applies our CSP headers and attributes when accessing data from the live site, ignoring the Kentico Mother. The conditional filter is a higher order function that will return the function to be used in the global filter provider. There are two lists of strings that let you configure subdomains or paths. They signify requests from the admin application. cmsctx/ is present for Form Builder. Be careful with the paths; otherwise, you may accidentally collide with a live site path and leave a vulnerability. For example, you might want to add admin/ to the path list. If you have an admin page on the live site, you will end up disabling CSP headers for that page.
Now we will create a FilterConfig that will define the CSP headers and attributes to be used globally. We are utilizing NWebsec to add CSP headers to our responses.
You can check out these resources to learn more about the directives and CSP as a whole.
Content Security Policy Reference, Content Security Policy (CSP)
Something to note, you can support older browsers that don’t have full support by including self, unsafe-inline, http:, and https: in the script-src directive. These will be ignored as long as strict-dynamic is present. In browsers that don’t support strict-dynamic the source will be ignored, and the other sources will be used instead.
You can also test your headers without preventing content from loading by using the ReportOnly equivalent of each attribute from NWebsec. Pairing this with the CspReportUriReportOnlyAttribute lets you post information on violations that would have occurred if the policy was active.
In the layout, we add an empty script with a manually applied nonce so that we can add it to the other styles and scripts in the HtmlOutput. We also add the event listener to replace the ones we removed with RemoveKenticoFormInlineEventHandlersFilter.cs.
Now you can run your application! You may find that you missed a couple of spots, or your directives may be a bit too restrictive. This is a lot of trial and error. Each site is unique, so I can only help you so much. You may even run into issues I haven’t experienced yet. To analyze the strength of your headers, you can use CSP Scanner. Overall, CSP headers can be quite a beast to conquer, especially if you’re retrofitting the headers. Hopefully, this post helps make your life easier when trying to implement CSP into your application.

Beer City Code is an annual conference for software developers held in Grand Rapids, MI, also known as Beer City, USA. Software creators of all types are welcome, even those who don’t care for beer.
The main conference is held Saturday, August 6. Note that, as we return to our first event since COVID, we will be keeping the event simple this year. There will be no workshops, diversity mixer, kids conference, or keynote for the 2022 event. We hope that these features of the show will return in 2023.
The Beer City Code conference grew out of the success of its predecessor, Grand Rapids DevDay, but was renamed in 2017 to embrace its much more broad appeal outside the Grand Rapids area.

3 Skills Every Junior Developer Needs to Succeed
After five (somewhat grueling) years of college, the day to finally begin my career as a junior web developer has arrived. In addition to being anxious to get started and build upon the knowledge I’ve gained through college and other self-learning projects, I couldn’t help but have countless questions running through my mind about what this experience would actually be like. Was I prepared enough? What would be expected of me? What level of knowledge did they hope for me to have? These may be similar to the thoughts you have as well.
So, the big question…what really is expected of a junior web developer? It’s been over six months since my first day as a junior web developer at BizStream, and I’m here to give you answers to those questions.
Okay, maybe not nothing, but starting out, it’s a pretty mutual thought on both sides with not knowing what to expect. It’s no secret that technology is changing daily, and it can be hard to keep up with – especially for someone who is just starting out. While searching for a job, one of my big concerns was that the company would expect me to know more than I actually knew. My ideal company to work for was one that could see my potential, and BizStream was that exact company.
When I started working at BizStream, I was happy to see how much they were willing to invest in me. My first few weeks on the job focused on giving me a clear understanding of who BizStream is, like the projects they work on, the technologies they use, and the required training. When I finally started getting into development work, they didn’t just throw me into the trenches. They began with paired programming and then moved me to my own tasks. BizStream has always been flexible when I ask for assistance when I get stuck on a problem, and everyone is always willing to extend a helping hand whenever I ask them for help.
While it wasn’t expected of me to know everything on my first day, I have learned a lot of things in these last few months that I think would have been helpful to know on my first day.
While these are still great resources, when it became important for me to start learning more technologies quicker, the best way to do that was by referencing the technology’s documentation. Since documentation is not written to give you the exact solution to every problem you run into, learning to comprehend documentation so that I can translate that into an appropriate solution was a bit of a learning curve for me.
However, after six months of referencing some documentation almost daily, I can happily report that it’s not much of a challenge for me anymore – it just takes consistent practice, as any newly learned trait does.
No matter your job, it’s always important to have good communication skills. Communication allows everyone in the team to be on the same page and work to be completed in the most efficient way possible. From a junior web developer’s point of view, communication will allow you to grow as a developer even quicker.
​As I mentioned earlier in this post, you were hired for your potential. Be transparent about what you know and what you don’t know. Your employer wants to see that you’re willing to learn and put forth the effort to enable you to gain the skills necessary to make yourself and the company successful. When you run into a problem with a task you’re working on and truly feel you’ve tried everything to solve the problem, reach out to someone who can provide you with some help. In my experience, everyone is always happy to help when possible, and if the person you reach out to for help can’t solve it, they will more than likely help you find someone who can give you the answers you’re looking for.
There you have it, everything you need to know to make yourself a successful junior web developer. Okay, maybe not everything you need to know, but you’re not expected to know everything, remember? At the end of the day, most of us starting a junior web developer role are fresh out of school or some other training that taught us to be a developer. In this role, your job is to mix being a student with being a professional, and sooner than you may realize, you’re going to be in a position where you are the person a junior developer is approaching for advice.

Balancing Our Proven Processes With Customer Needs
Starting a new project with a new client is always an interesting endeavor. In most cases, you take two separate teams with their own unique processes and workflows they are comfortable with, and join them together. Just as important as it is to determine what we are building, it is also essential to figure out how we will work together to make the project successful. What tools are we using? Where will information live? How will we communicate? Going through the phases of team development – Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, and Adjourning – while working together for the first time on a new project can easily add a heightened sense of concern for all parties before we actually start to feel like and function as one cohesive team, which is our ultimate goal.
Being on the agency side of the equation, this is something we see a lot. Over the years, our team has formed a process for how we like to do things – not just because we are comfortable with the way we do things but because we have seen effective results with our methods and tools. Yet, understandably, our customers feel the same way about their processes and tools and usually request we work within their systems. It’s their project and information to retain, so that request makes sense. The challenge on our side is not only learning the requirements for their project, but also learning how to use a system, or several, that we may not be as familiar with. While we historically are not opposed to this, there are times when we will lobby a little harder for doing things the way we are accustomed to, particularly when there is a tight deadline and we must move fast to start delivering as soon as possible.
We recently ran into a situation just like the above. Thankfully, our client found Unito, a tool specializing in two-way integrations, allowing our team to use our project management system, Jira, and the client to use theirs, Trello. While the same company owns these two project management products, they are very different. Here are some things Unito let us do to get the two applications talking to each other:
The client Trello board was used for tracking many different aspects of the project, not just our development effort. In order to not have to delete stories that did not involve our team, we created a rule so only cards were created in our Jira backlog if they were labeled “BizStream.”
Keeping all stakeholders aware of the latest work was key, so we opted to map fields and use a two-way sync to ensure the items in both systems shared due dates, assignees, comments, descriptions, summaries, attachments, and links to the respective card in the other system.
We were able to map the Jira card status in its respective column to the Trello list status. Taking advantage of the existing automation we use in Jira, a simple movement of a card from our Development Team to our QA team, would automatically move the same card in both systems to the correct columns, and assign the person who is supposed to take ownership of that story next.
What we loved most about this was the avoidance of duplicated efforts for both teams. A story written in one system appears in the correct spot in the other system, with the exact same information. It also gave each team the ability to work the way they were accustomed to, yet we are all viewing the same items, just a little differently. At the end of the project, both teams have a record of what was done, when it was done, and by whom.
It wasn’t seamless, and there was a bit of a learning curve to start, but we managed to modify it as we went along, refining it to the point that it saved both teams a ton of time. Instead of making manual updates and needing more meetings to provide status updates, we could focus on continuing to move forward with the build. Another bonus is that as we made revisions and found better ways of doing things, there is an option to apply those changes to all current and previous cards in the project, or just the ones created from that point on. It’s a nice touch. At the end of the day, Unito is helping us to keep our team happy and our clients happy, and we’re actively attempting to utilize it with additional client projects as well.

Join Brian McKeiver, BizStream’s Solution Architect and Microsoft Azure MVP, at THAT Conference in Round Rock, Texas, on Wednesday, May 25, 2022!
State-of-the-art Search with Azure Cognitive Search
We all know that providing a good search experience for website visitors is hard. Everyone expects it to “just” work like Google or Amazon. Maybe there is a better way, maybe we fix this with a little help from some AI. Join the session to see how you can leverage Cognitive Services with Azure Cognitive Search in your apps. With the newly minted semantic search abilities, this technology can provide results that are semantically closer to the intent of original query. For example, can your search return the right results for a query like “in the last 5 years” or will it just return matches based on those 5 words without any context. You will also learn how to enhance and enrich search through Cognitive Service Skills like natural language processing, image analysis, and entity recognition capabilities. Don’t know what those are? Well, that’s not a problem because you will find out. You can expect to walk away knowing how to generate your own enrichment pipeline that leverages the power of AI to solve your search woes. Why not use the same integrated Microsoft natural language stack that Bing and Office have used for more than a decade into your site? Maybe AI can make it “just” work.

Say Goodbye to Universal Analytics, Say Hello to Google Analytics 4
In July 2023, Universal Analytics (UA) – the version of Google Analytics we have depended on for around 10 years will stop processing hits. Users will have six months beyond that date to access historical data before Google’s new analytics product, Google Analytics 4 (GA4), becomes the new standard and all the data in Universal Analytics (UA) is erased.
This is a HUGE change, and it means that GA4 will fully replace UA as of July 1, 2023. The good news is that you’ve got some time to start implementing GA4 on your site(s) and get used to the updated analytics.
UA is in need of a refresh. The underlying system has become slow and clunky, not to mention that it no longer reflects how we use digital technology today.
The current version of UA has been around since October 2012. That’s 10 years without a major update. In software terms, that is an eternity. Not only is UA technologically anchored to websites in an increasingly omnichannel world, but it has also fallen out of step with modern laws and expectations around privacy and the handling of personal data.
We’ve seen rulings out of the EU that infer the use of UA can be a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because it sends its analytical data to the US, including details about IP addresses. A new way of processing the data needed to be implemented. GA4 offers greater control over privacy, with limits on how long data is stored, and anonymizing IP information. Along with those privacy issues, UA is built around third-party cookies for tracking attribution. With Apple’s Safari already blocking third-party cookies and Chrome looking to remove them at the end of 2023 the old way needed to go.
One of the key differences between UA and GA4 is in how the data is structured. In UA you have Users, Sessions, Pages, Events, and Products. In GA4, it’s gotten much simpler. There are only Users and Events. For example, in GA4, instead of having different tracking formats for a Page view vs an Event vs a Transaction, everything is an Event. This unfortunately means you can’t just copy and paste what you have in UA over to GA4.
In GA4 Users also take center stage over Sessions. Metrics that used to be measured ‘per session’ are now more commonly based on “the user”. For example, conversions per user, event count per user, etc. GA4 puts a focus on the full customer journey, Google wants to highlight that a customer may interact with your brand across multiple sessions before converting. Previously, focusing on just a session conversion rate missed the entire journey which needs to be understood.
The bounce rate has changed in a good way, it’s gone. Instead, GA4 focuses on Engaged Users. An Engaged User maybe someone who stays on the page for 10 seconds or longer, views more than one page, or triggers a conversion. This is great news for content-based websites (including our own BizStream website), as bounce rates can be a misleading indicator.
Views (in admin) are gone. They’ve been replaced with Account, Properties, and Data Streams, where a website might be one data stream and an app another. For example, you can no longer make a View out of people visiting your US website and another View of people visiting your German site. You can still get this data, you just need to filter within the reports.
Another huge change is that data is now only stored for 14 months. What? Analytics are only stored for a little more than a year? Yes, it’s true. If you want to store the data longer, you would need to connect it to BigQuery (for a fee). This means you should probably consider how much data you actually need, or want, to back up, and how you want to look at your data historically.
GA4 – which has been around since 2019 (initially called app + web) – provides a much faster user interface, with deeper insights and features allowing you to drill down and take a more detailed look at the full customer journey.
If you’ve looked under the hood at GA4’s new interface and decided, “No, thank you,” you’re not alone. I felt that way when first starting to use GA4. The interface and terminology are different from the version you’ve known for some time. Finding what you need may feel complicated.

Boost Your Productivity With a Custom Application Switcher
If you are anything like me, you likely have ten or more programs or applications that are constantly running on your computer. Whether you are working or just using your computer for fun, it can be difficult to juggle multiple tasks while also staying productive. So what is the solution? How can you focus and manage your time more efficiently? To start, try to pinpoint the repetitive tasks you perform every day. Even if these tasks only take a few seconds at a time, they still add up and can hurt the flow of your daily processes. In general, I try to automate the tasks that can be automated and then find ways to make the remaining tasks more efficient, like using helpful keyboard shortcuts. Some repetitive tasks are inevitable, but we can still find ways to speed them up to the point where we don’t even realize we are doing them. My favorite way of doing this is by using a custom application switcher that is easy to build, even easier to use, and completely free.
So what is a “custom” application switcher anyway? And what do I need to build and use it? In the simplest terms, an application switcher is exactly what it sounds like. It quickly switches the program or application that is currently in focus on your computer. This can be useful when you are constantly hopping back and forth between different applications and need a more streamlined way of doing so.
To build the application switcher, you will need a Windows computer, AutoHotkey, and your favorite text or code editor. AutoHotkey (also known as AHK) is a free, open-source Windows program for creating scripts. These scripts can be as simple or complex as you wish and can perform any number of tasks on your computer, including macros, auto-clicking, filling out forms, and more. For our purposes today, we will be using it to remap keyboard keys to open and switch to specific applications.
To get started, download and install AutoHotkey. There isn’t much to the program itself. If you open it after installation, you will see that it is essentially a window that is filled with tutorials and documentation. Reading the documentation within the application or on the AutoHotkey site can be a great way to familiarize yourself with the program and figure out how to use it to write custom scripts. Once you feel comfortable with the general syntax of the scripting language and the functionality of the program, it is time to create our first script file.
Open up your favorite text or code editor. I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code because it is free and has a bunch of useful extensions that can greatly improve your experience with writing code (and scripts). My favorite VS Code extension made for AutoHotkey is AutoHotkey Plus which adds AHK language support, syntax highlighting, and debugging functionality.
Create a new script file and name it whatever you want; just make sure it has the “.ahk” file extension. For this tutorial, I named mine “Switcher.ahk”. If you want your application switcher to automatically run each time you start your computer, place the script file inside the “Startup” folder. To get to the folder, press and hold the Windows key and then press the “R” key to open up the “Run” application. In the input next to the word “Open”, type “shell:startup” and click OK. The “Startup” folder will open up in a Windows Explorer window where you can place your file.
When creating our AHK script, it is important to remember that each script within the script file is generally made up of two components: the key(s) to press in order to perform an action, and then the action itself. The key portion of the script can be a single key or a key combination. AutoHotkey uses the following characters to denote the modifier keys on a keyboard:
Using the above symbols, if we wanted to create a shortcut by pressing Alt + Windows + X, the beginning of the script would look like “!#x::” without the quotes.Each key or key combination is followed by two colons which are then followed by the action or actions to take. It is completely up to you to decide which keys or key combinations to use in order to switch to your favorite applications. My personal favorite is using the keypad on the right side of a full-size keyboard. If you don’t have a keypad, another option is to use the F1 through F12 keys (however many you wish to use). If neither of those options work for you, try using Windows + Alt + the first letter that your application starts with. Unsure of which to use? Set up a couple of different shortcut methods and see which one feels the most natural to you!
In my application switcher, each shortcut does the following:
In order to target specific applications, I use the Window Spy application that comes installed with AutoHotkey. Open it up and then open your application. With your application in focus, Window Spy will tell you information about your application that can be used to target it within a script. The most reliable way to target an application is by using the “ahk_exe” or the “ahk_class” property.
Let’s get to writing. With your script file open in your text or code editor, we can start laying out the overall structure of the script. I like to add a comment above each individual script in the file to help me quickly find the application name and what keyboard shortcut it is using. You can add comments to AHK scripts by typing a semicolon followed by the comment. If you are having a hard time deciding on applications to use in your script, try to think of which ones you use the most. I personally use Chrome, Slack, and Spotify frequently while I am working, so those are the ones I started with.
Using the Window Spy application, open your first application and find the value next to “ahk_exe” or “ahk_class” that you plan on using. Remember that this value needs to be unique for each application; otherwise you may run into issues. Some applications share the same “ahk_class” (like Chrome and Slack), so it is best to use “ahk_exe” in those cases.
Under your first comment in the script file, enter the keyboard shortcut you wish to use. To keep this tutorial simple, I will be using the function keys (F1, F2, etc.). In my case, the line will be “F1::” without the quotes.
Below the shortcut, we will use the WinExist function. This function checks if the specified application is running, and if it is, it will perform an action. There is also a negated version that performs an action if the application is not running: !WinExist. In our case, we will use the negated version to run the application if it’s not currently running. For this example, I am using Slack as the application.
The updated script will look something like this:
Notice the Run function being used to launch the application. Some applications will require you to point to the direct path of the executable, while others (like Chrome) will allow you to simply put the name of the file (chrome.exe). If you are having trouble launching your application, follow these steps:
The next part of the script will check if the window does exist using the WinExist function. If it does exist, we want to activate the application by bringing it into focus. The activation piece of the script is done with the WinActivate command, which can be used in conjunction with the WinExist command to automatically activate the application if it exists.
The updated script will look something like this:
This next part is optional, but I find it to be extremely helpful for certain applications. If the application exists and is in focus, we can then perform a specific action in the application when our keyboard shortcut is pressed again. I use this “special action” to cycle through unread messages in Slack, play/pause music in Spotify, and cycle through my tabs in Chrome. The possibilities are pretty much endless, so I encourage you to get creative with your applications and workflows. Let’s see how this extra function can be set up!
In the next line of our script, we are going to utilize the WinActive command. This command checks to see if our application is currently in focus and active. If the application is active, we can perform our specific action. In most cases, this specific action will end up being another keyboard shortcut, but you can perform additional actions as well as long as it is something that AutoHotkey supports. For this example, I am going to be using the keyboard shortcut Alt + Shift + Up (up arrow) in Slack, which navigates to the next unread conversation. In order to perform this keyboard shortcut, I am using the Send command.
The updated script will look something like this:
At the end of the above example, I have added the word “Return” which lets AutoHotkey know that it should stop executing the script at that point. Every application script that we add to our script file will need to end with “Return” in order for it to function correctly.
Now that we have a fully functional script for a single application, it is time to expand our script to handle other applications as well. I have given you most of the tools to do this on your own, but I will give you one more full example that has a slightly different approach.
In the above example, there are some key differences from the first script. Instead of using three different “If” statements, it only uses two and then utilizes an “Else” statement at the end to activate the application instead. The order of the script is slightly different than the first example, but they both accomplish the same end goal. If you are looking for a script for switching to Chrome and then cycling through your open tabs (by sending Ctrl + Tab), this is a great one to use.
After completing the scripts for your first one or two applications, let’s officially test the application switcher. Save your file and then double-click on it in Windows Explorer to run it. With the script running, try pressing the keyboard shortcuts associated with your applications. If successful, you should be able to launch and switch between your applications with ease.
Let’s walk through my examples above with Slack and Chrome to really understand the workflow. I am working at my computer, and Slack and Chrome aren’t running yet. If I press F1, Slack will open. If I press F2, Chrome will open. If I press F1 again, Slack will become active and in focus. Finally, if I press F1 a third time, it will send the keyboard shortcut to the application to jump to my next unread conversation. If I keep pressing F1, it will keep going to the next unread conversation until there are no more new messages to read. After catching up with my messages, I can press F2 again to switch to Chrome and continue on with my work. Pretty cool, huh?
Thanks for taking the time to read about my custom application switcher using AutoHotkey. Hopefully, I have inspired you to create one on your own to help boost your productivity and streamline your workflows. I recommend starting with a basic version that handles a couple of different applications to start and then adding more as you get more comfortable with using it. Play around with different keyboard shortcuts and “special actions” to really give it a custom feel. Happy scripting!

Building Your Brand Online
Establishing a strong and consistent online brand is essential to establishing your business as knowledgeable, trustworthy, and reliable. Plus, it’ll make you look good too.
You can’t build your brand online if you don’t know what it is. At a base level, determining who you are as a company and what you stand for becomes the foundation for establishing the rest of your brand. Every company is different, does different things, and has different goals. So what your brand ends up looking like, sounding like, and feeling like should be unique to your specific company. For best results, work with a branding agency to help you through the branding process. (We specialize in developing brands, and we’d love to help you out.)
Once the parts and pieces of your brand have been defined and created (logo, graphic elements, colors, typography, tone of voice, photography style, etc.), you’ll have the assets you need to start building your brand online. These assets are usually collected, organized, and defined in a brand guide.
Let’s take a look at how Google, Spotify, Atlassian, and Netflix convey their brand standards.
The colors and typography used on your website and online branded content affect how people experience your brand, so it’s essential to use them regularly and consistently. Your brand colors and typography are two of the most important elements of your brand because when used well, they create a visual throughline across all of your branded content.
Your brand should have a range of colors and font styles to choose from. But don’t go overboard with the color and font combinations. Instead, create a handful of effective combinations that can be used in a variety of situations. This will give you brand consistency without sacrificing brand personality.
Another key element of a successful brand is creating and using brand expression. Brand expression is the particular way your brand is conveyed (or expressed) across various media. Any set of brand assets (logo, colors, fonts, graphic elements, patterns, imagery, etc.) can be combined in millions of ways. However, throughout your brand development process and during the creation of the first few marketing materials, you’ll start to discover specific combinations of brand assets that are most effective in communicating your message and your brand. These specific combinations of assets are collectively known as your brand expression. For example, one particular combination of a large headline and brand pattern might be best for blog posts. Another combination of subtle headlines, photos, and icons might be better for anniversary announcements. There’s no limit to the way your brand can be expressed, as long as the executions as a whole feel like they’re all part of the same brand.
Your brand is more than just the visuals you use in your marketing materials. It is also the way your brand “talks.” This is known as your brand voice. Your brand voice is the way you talk to your customers through written headlines, body copy, and other branded communications. Your brand voice can have any style you want, as long as it feels true to your core values and brand personality. It can be playful, serious, ominous, quirky, or fun. A well-executed brand voice adds another layer of interaction that helps make a brand more memorable in the minds of your customers.
Your online presence is much more than just your website. Customers interact with your brand online in many other ways. These other interactions should be just as consistent with your brand as anything else you create. Customers may interact via social networks, customer support, chatbots, job postings, and so on. Each customer touchpoint has its own limitations for how you can express your brand (logo size/placement, branded images (or not), amount of text, etc.). So, play to each service’s strength. If it’s a social network, include more branded images, well-written copy, and quality links. If it’s a chatbot or job posting, make sure the copy is in the right tone of voice for your brand. Never miss an opportunity to build your brand in the eyes of the customer, no matter how large or small the interaction may be.
In our interconnected digital world, customers interact with your brand in a variety of ways. The best way to stand out from the noise and stick in the minds of your customers is with consistent and engaging branding. Whether it’s a glimpse of a social post they see as they swipe through their feed, the wording of a reply email, or the visual impact of your home page as they click through from an internet search. The better you express your brand at every level, the greater your chances of increasing your brand awareness and growing your customer base.
We love developing brands and helping them make an impact online. Read more about our branding and design services, or contact us to start your next branding project.

How We Handle Project Deployments
At BizStream, we follow a development lifecycle (also called DevOps) that’s built to increase efficiency, provide continuous delivery, and improve software quality. Software deployments are only a small part of this overall lifecycle, but they’re the main focus of this blog post. First, I’ll briefly cover our development process from a high level so you can see where deployments fit into the big picture, and then we’ll dig into the technical details of deployments.
I’ll first lay out our development process from a very high level, starting with sprint planning using Agile and then ending with our deployment process.
First, I’ll start by discussing a development step that helps reduce the pain of deploying database changes. Database changes need to happen in a particular order, and it’s easy to make mistakes if the steps aren’t tested and performed carefully. The best way to handle database changes is with automation such as Entity Framework (EF) or Xperience by Kentico.
Version Control systems are essential to all automated deployment processes. They record all software changes made by developers and help us determine what code goes where and at what times by utilizing a branching strategy. At BizStream, we use the Git Flow branching strategy. Put simply, it’s a process that determines how finished code moves through the system before it gets merged into its final destination, the main code branch that is deployed to production servers at the end of an Agile sprint. Gitflow can be used for projects that have scheduled release cycles, like most projects at BizStream, and for the DevOps best practice of continuous delivery. Gitflow assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact (atlassian.com).Here are the specific branches we use at BizStream and their roles:
In the past, we used a manual “copy and paste” process to perform deployments. We built the code on our local machine and copied the compiled code and web files over to the live server as fast as we could. Of course, we ran into issues, some changes were forgotten, deployments took up a lot of our time, and they were stressful. We don’t like taking our client’s sites down for extended periods of time either. So, we decided to automate these manual deployment steps using Azure DevOps and Octopus.
The first thing we wanted to automate was our build process. An automated build compiles the code files into DLLs. It then compresses those DLLs, along with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, into a deployment package (kind of like a zip folder of code and web files that can be easily transferred to a server). To automate this process, we typically set up several different build triggers that kick off the compilation and bundling of our code.
Build triggers are a signal to Azure DevOps to build the code in a specific repository branch. These are the same branches we discussed above in this article. At BizStream, we typically utilize the following branch build triggers:
So, what actually happens when a build is triggered? Here’s a list of our most used automated build steps:
The second thing we automated was our release process. We don’t want to pass around server credentials between each other, have developers logging into production sites late at night, or manually copying over files and database changes by hand anymore.
After the deployment package is created and sent to the staging directory by the automated build process, we utilize Azure DevOps or Octopus to automatically copy over the packaged code to specific servers. Below is a list of the most used steps in our automated release processes:
There isn’t a one-size-fits-all deployment solution that works for every team or project, but the deployment process outlined above usually works very well for us and our clients. If you’d like more information about the best DevOps and Continuous Integration practices, I highly recommend taking a look at the book Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim.

Simplifying User Stories and Acceptance Criteria With Templates and Automation
Call it what you will; a personal philosophy, a theory, idiotic, but I have long held the belief that every personality trait is a double-edged sword. Patience is a wonderful attribute but, taken too far, can turn to apathy. Dedication to an ideal or a goal is very admirable, but not when it is to the exclusion of all else. Finding balance in life is one of the most difficult and impactful things we can do.
For me, I struggle to find the line between finding the best way to accomplish a given task and actually getting the damn thing done. It’s easy to spend so much time improving a process or an approach that, when it comes to actually putting it into action, you have to rush it and disregard half your work to make a deadline. That’s why, as often as I can, I try to remove the necessity to rethink things on a continual basis. That doesn’t mean continuous improvement isn’t still a goal, just that I’m going to check-in and improve on things every so often rather than changing things in the middle of a task. This provides consistency and a big benefit to efficiency because now we can template and automate things since they aren’t changing every single time we use them.
Having a template for each card/ticket we create accomplishes a couple of things. First, it ensures that I don’t forget to include something I need to. Second, it is one less thought process I have to put energy into when dealing with already-complex issues.
The late Steve Jobs famously wore the same outfit every day. Many other notable figures such as Mark Zuckerberg, Albert Einstein, and President Obama did something similar. The reason? Decision fatigue. The idea is that your brain really only has the capacity to make so many decisions in a day. The more menial the decision, the less of that budget it uses up, but it still uses some of it. By eliminating a decision, we give ourselves a little back in terms of brain budget for the day. That’s the goal here.
So without further ado, here is my mildly-interesting-but-hopefully-useful template for capturing user stories, acceptance criteria, and all the other information needed for a feature.
I like Atlassian’s definition of what a user story is. “A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.” User stories are meant to answer the question “what’s the point?”. It’s the lens through which all the other information should be viewed.
We used to have designs documented in a single spot and just put something like “See article detail design” on a card. We’ve found it’s much more helpful to link to a specific design or a specific part of a design wherever possible. Especially as front-end frameworks and new ways of thinking about content management drive us to be ever more modular and component/widget-based. I also find it very helpful to include a quick screenshot of the feature since, often, designs do not break things down component by component but have them in context.
Rarely does anything ever get finalized in a single sitting. Usually, there are initial requirements, design reviews, questions/clarifications from the design review, re-evaluation of requirements, technical considerations, and so on and so forth that all need to get hammered out before we’re ready to put a feature into a sprint. This section helps me keep track of where we’re at with a given feature, so I don’t have to remember what we still need to figure out.
Assumptions are a common thing in agile development. Here we’re listing things like
Anything that we’re basing our acceptance criteria off of that would otherwise affect the content entry or user experience of a feature is listed here.
This is one of the most important sections. Acceptance criteria are the details that provide a checklist for developers and QA alike. That doesn’t necessarily mean this needs to be loaded with complexity. Sometimes it’s as simple as listing the parts of the feature that are editable by the editor and which are static. Often we will list things here that are not obvious when looking at the designs, such as what API the data is coming from or what happens when I click that button over there.
Automated UI testing is becoming more and more integrated into everything we build. If you’ve ever run into a situation where you get a customer complaint that a form isn’t working and, after investigating, you discover it was a regression problem that only appeared on production from a deployment you did a week ago, you’ll understand why. Websites are large and complicated. It’s impractical to expect humans to check every single page, section, feature, etc., every time a change is made. Automated testing allows us to let the system do the work for us on the most important sections of the site to make sure those forms still work and that the 3rd party API we’re using to bring in job results didn’t change without warning and break things.
The reality is that there can often be months between first writing all the details for a feature and actually implementing it. I can barely remember what I was working on two hours ago let alone how we decided we were going to build a feature on one of our five projects six months ago. This is the spot where we list notes to ourselves about how we planned to solve a particular problem or what architecture we’re going for so that future-us doesn’t have to swear more than necessary.
Okay, so this is not going to be an in-depth dive into automation. Instead, I just want to share with you what I use. Rather than have to use any brainpower to remember where I’ve written my template so I can copy and paste it into the card/ticket I’m writing, I just wrote an AutoHotkey script to do it for me. If you’re not familiar with AutoHotkey, it is a scripting language that can do pretty much anything you can do on your computer. Open programs, automatically copy text from anywhere and search Google for it, etc. For a complete guide on how to get started with AutoHotkey you can check out their docs here.
In this case we’re really just using it for a text macro with some added flair. You’ll notice a bunch of “extra” characters in the below script. We use Jira as our project management software so I’ve put Jira-flavored Markdown into it to pre-format a bunch of stuff. The Markdown Jira uses is relatively standard but, depending on the system you use, YMMV (your mileage may vary for the non-l33t 5p34k125).
Basically, all you have to do is type “]us” and hit “space” or “enter” and you’ll wind up with exactly what you saw in the template above. Hopefully, some of you find this useful and take it and make it your own. Set your own shortcut and update it to reflect your system and needs.

Five Reasons I Love Working at BizStream: A Developer’s Perspective
Ahhh, 2022, the year the world will finally get back to normal… or is it? If you’re a developer at this point in time, you know how crazy the job market has been recently. After the economic shock COVID-19 brought in March 2020, the developer market has gotten absolutely crazy. Money’s cheap due to low-interest rates, so companies are willing to pay through the nose to get talented developers working for them, causing developers to jump ship left and right trying to pick up sign-on bonuses and marginally higher salaries.
At BizStream, we know this isn’t sustainable and are doing everything we can (within reason) to try and stay as competitive as possible without overextending ourselves. One of the ways we’ve always attempted to attract talent was with our outstanding company culture, and I’d love to share my top 5 reasons why I love working at BizStream.

My Transition From Childhood Development to Software Development
Less than a year ago, I couldn’t tell you what a for loop was. I worked with children with cognitive delays and autism in a residential care facility. I also spent several of those years doing ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis) in a clinical setting, which will be important to note later in this post.
In September 2016, I attended the Michigan Autism Conference in Kalamazoo, MI. Toward the end of the keynote speakers’ speech, they asked, “Do we have any software developers here? We are in serious need of more ABA software.” For the rest of the conference and the weekend following it, I kept thinking, “What else could they possibly need for software?” That following Monday, I went back to work. We all had iPads that had one of the most widely used ABA data tracking applications (at the time). As I went through the workday, I kept catching myself wondering why the app would behave a certain way. Why did I have to type in the values in some spots, use a slider in other spots, and “just know” what a button did in another spot? As it turns out, this was not so much about the quality of the code written for the app, as it was about the tools the administrators were given and the lack of support they received after their initial purchase of the app.
After finishing out my day of clinical therapy with the children, I would open another portal on a computer where I would open two separate forms to input all of the data I entered into the iPad. The Behavior Analyst would then use the data for their reports. This was when the cartoon lightbulb turned on above my head; I didn’t know a thing about software development, but I knew there had to be a way to streamline this process. Every time I went through the tedious task of re-entering data, my curiosity grew – until I began doing the logical thing – looking at Computer Science degrees from universities. Mind you, I didn’t even know what code was, but I figured it had to be pretty much the same as changing the background of my MySpace profile to lime green and embedding obnoxious ska songs that you couldn’t turn off – I was good at that. But, believe it or not, working in the non-profit social work field does not lend you much time or money. So I decided a CS degree would not be in the cards in the near future, but something I could think about for later. After all, I genuinely loved what I was doing, and I was good at it – why would I think about switching careers?
Fast-forward 3 years to the fall of 2018 – I had just started a role at working with stained glass; building, designing, and restoring windows and fixtures. It turned out that the mental health field sucks a lot of energy out of you, and I needed to change it up for a bit. I had completely forgotten about my interest in software until a friend of mine invited me to attend a free “Intro To Coding” class with them at the Grand Circus campus in Grand Rapids. I immediately took up the offer. Once there, we worked on simple things in JavaScript; variables, “Hello world”, etc. This is where I started understanding how vast the computer world really is. It was a bit overwhelming, but that just made me all the more intrigued. I immediately started looking into the bootcamps but wasn’t sure if I trusted the promises they made … that was a lot of money to throw at a three-month course. I put it on the backburner again. I needed some more evidence that this is something people see success in.
Around mid-summer of 2019, I realized that custom glasswork was just not something I wanted to keep pursuing; I was tired of going home with my hands cut up every day- among other safety risks. I missed my job with the kids and decided to come back full-time from my on-call status. It was great. I knew how to do everything, and I had a great report with the other staff and clients almost immediately. The warm and fuzzy feeling took a sharp nosedive as soon as the pandemic shut down started. When you are in an environment with a bunch of children that don’t like changing routines, stopping the spread of a virus is nearly impossible. The stress of being actively exposed constantly on top of the usual stress was all I needed to push me to make a change. There are so many remote jobs available, and I know I loved the tiny amount of coding I had learned. Let’s do it.  It’s late December, and I have a workbook to finish to be fully accepted into the bootcamp. Looking back, I cannot believe the amount of stress a for loop put on me. I spent hours on a problem that would take me less than 10 seconds now. At the moment, it seemed so difficult, but being able to view and measure my progress has remained one of the biggest motivators to keep going with it. A week into the class came the “Oh, this will always be a challenge” feeling, which is actually quite comforting in a strange way. From what I have gathered from everyone else in the industry, there will always be more to learn. The great thing about the industry, and BizStream in particular, is that it fosters growth and knowledge. Rather than throwing you to the wolves, so to speak, you are given a chance to ask questions without ridicule, explore further education opportunities and commiserate with other devs when neither the official documentation nor Google have the answers you’re seeking.
The interview process at BizStream after doing a bootcamp was incredibly intimidating, considering I was competing with people that had completed four-year CS degrees. Still, I felt confident enough to admit when I did not know how to answer something. After all, I am still learning. BizStream seemed to lean into this and made it apparent that they would be willing to continue that process with me. As someone coming from a background in social work and case management, they assured me that my hands-on knowledge in the field was invaluable. They were quick to offer me a hybrid position as a junior developer and support desk specialist.
The two roles work really well together; I am asked questions that involve some searching – helping me understand the code better while also learning how to answer those questions more quickly from understanding the code. My previous experience in the social work field helps me know customers’ needs and their urgency. Knowing how confusing many of the local, state, and federal processes are with youth case management has also aided in communication with clients. BizStream genuinely values my input on subjects about social work and youth-related subjects, which keeps me motivated to improve continuously. My opportunities at BizStream will continue to open if the team keeps rowing in the same direction. Dropping everything to switch careers might sound terrifying (it is), but if you are willing to fully commit to networking and practicing (and more practicing), you can accomplish it. There are many people in the tech community that would love to help you succeed.

Integrating ASP.NET Core and Vue.js
It’s hard enough trying to choose frameworks for your tech stack. It sometimes becomes frustrating when you find out they don’t integrate very easily. Recently I’ve had the opportunity to integrate ASP.NET Core and Vue.js so I thought I’d share my knowledge with you!
First, let’s create a Blank Solution. Within this solution, we will be creating two projects. Creating two separate projects allows a better separation of concerns between back-end and front-end code.
Next, we will add an ASP.NET Core Web Application project and use the Web Application (Model-View-Controller) template.
Finally, we create a Blank Node.js Web Application project.
Our solution tree should look something like this:
Make sure to go to the properties of your solution and set the startup project to single and select the MVC project.
Let’s install the packages we will need. Instead of installing packages manually through the command line, we will instead populate the package.json in our Node.js project and install all the packages in one go. Simply copy and paste the following code block, replacing the default code. Then run a clean install of the packages.
In our Index view of the Home feature, we can add a custom element.
This is where our matching Vue component will mount.  Then in the layout, we can add some stylesheets and scripts that will be generated later by Webpack. In the head of our layout we will add these link tags:
And at the end of our body will add these script tags:
That’s it for our MVC project! We’ve given our Vue application a home to live. Now we have to move in.
Let’s create a file, webpack.config.js, and a folder named src. Then, rename server.js to index.js and move it into the src folder. Within the src folder, create two more folders: components and styles. Finally, in the styles folder create style.scss.Our Node.js Project should look something like this:
Create a file named HelloWorld.vue in our components folder and insert the following code:
Hello, world!
In the same folder, create a JavaScript file named component-loader. First, let’s import Vue and our HelloWorld component.
Second, let’s create an array of objects that contains our component and its corresponding custom element name.
When you add more Vue components, all you will need to do is import the component and add another object with its reference and custom element name to the components array. I suggest translating from pascal-case to kebab-case as per Vue’s style guide, but ultimately the choice is up to you.For example,
Finally, let’s create and export the function that will render our Vue components.
This function will take the components array and check if each custom element is present on the current page’s DOM. If it finds the element, it initializes and mounts the related Vue component. Once mounted, we’re in Vue land!In index.js we want to import our component loader and call it.
Last but not least, we want to configure Webpack. Let’s add our constants. This includes plugin imports, paths, and babel configuration. For brevity, we’ll skip how this all works and just go through the setup.
Next, we insert our module.exports
If you have a different structure to your solution, you may need to tweak the path constants and entry points to suit your needs.
With that, we’ve integrated MVC and Vue!Once within a Vue entry point, you have all the great parts of Vue such as single-file components and reactive data. Adding more component entry points is easy too.There is one caveat. Vue components have no elegant way to receive data from a Razor view. It is possible to send data through an API controller in the MVC project and make an AJAX call from your Vue components; however, we’ll have to cover that in a future article so stay tuned!

Positivity and its Impact on Work Culture
On average, Americans worked 34.4 hours per week in 2019. That translates to over 20% of the week we spend at work. Shouldn’t spending that much time at work be a positive experience?
At BizStream, we live by our Core Values, which is the foundation of our culture:
Be Positive is extremely important because it plays a role in all the values. But what does “Be Positive” mean at BizStream, exactly?
It’s well known that there’s a favorable correlation between positive employees and positive culture. So how can we create a positive culture, you say? I’m glad you asked.
The first task should be to understand the current culture and evaluate what strengths and weaknesses exist. Strengths should be fortified, enhanced, and potentially celebrated. Identifying weaknesses will give focus to possible adjustments that can be made to achieve the desired culture. Getting input from the employees should also be paramount. Business leaders do not always have the same perspective on company culture as the employees.
One way for leadership to ensure a healthy environment is to build trust by communicating openly, honestly, and transparently when getting employee feedback about company culture. Make employees feel like they are a part of the company by emphasizing a team atmosphere. Allow employees to provide input and listen to them. Allowing employees the opportunity to provide feedback on something as big as establishing or changing company culture can bring everyone together and provide them with purpose.
Set expectations and goals and measure those goals frequently. Providing feedback is also critical to establishing cultural dos and don’ts and affirming open lines of communication. It also brings into view the bullet point “assume the best intentions.” We often think of feedback as a source of correction or pointing out needed improvement, but feedback can take many forms. Feedback can also be a recognition of going above and beyond. Recognizing individuals for their good deeds can be as crucial as identifying mistakes. Regular check-ins and one-on-one meetings without an agenda are great for generating trust and creating additional channels of communication for feedback in both directions between management and employees.
There are numerous events throughout the year at BizStream, including our annual golf outing, internal celebrations, a camping trip, March Madness parties, and company picnics, this year held at Michigan’s Adventure. Each of these events brings everyone together in a fun and social capacity.
We also have the regular Lunch and Learn events where topics range from benefits to a discussion panel on Kentico CI.
Having events, such as team-building activities or social events, helps to create an inclusive environment. Provide short surveys to get employee feedback—again, another option for communication that can potentially be anonymous if you have challenges with employees not speaking up honestly.
Organizations should invest in their employees’ wellness because it will help build a positive environment and generate community. An employer who makes an employee feel like they matter helps give meaning to that employee’s work. If possible, offer employees benefits that can positively impact them—gym/yoga memberships, mental health resources, assistance programs, and other things that can help their general well-being.
BizStream offers several benefits directly towards our well-being. Many BizStreamers workout together and challenge each other at CrossFit Allendale, as the membership is paid for by the company. If CrossFit isn’t your thing, BizStream offers gym stipends. We have the opportunity to do a 23andMe DNA genetic test to find out health and family data. Generous PTO and flexible schedules also provide us with the time we need—be it for vacation or if you just need to flex some time because you have a contractor coming to estimate your leaking roof.
The beneficial effects of having a positive culture are extensive:
Furthermore, there is the potential for increased recruitment opportunities due to positive word of mouth, reviews, or feedback. A positive culture could net you some local, regional, or national awards to help further promote your brand and business, including recruitment. Conversely, if a poor culture is in place and employees leaving the company write bad reviews, this could impact recruitment.
Don’t just set up a vague outline of values the company should adopt, define each of those values further to provide ample understanding for all employees. Every company should seek its own set of values to match its principles and goals. This can guide the way for cultivating the type of atmosphere the company wants and the type of employees it wants to attract. And most importantly—live those values from the top down. Asking employees to abide by a cultural framework that isn’t respected by all is a quick way to allow good culture to deteriorate.

How to Set up Windows Authentication With .NET 5
When building an intranet-facing utility, making sure the correct people are the only ones getting access can be crucial. While there are many other ways to implement authentication, Windows Authentication is one of the easiest and has the advantage of using the existing security infrastructure of your Windows domain environment. A word of caution, though; Windows Authentication should only be used for an internal-facing application only. It will work over the internet, but that presents a large security headache you don’t want.
In order to use Windows Authentication, there are a few things you need to have set up beforehand that are not covered in this post.
The first thing you need to do is create a new project in Visual Studio. The easiest way to accomplish this is in the command prompt, but first, we need to create a directory to store our files in.Open VSCode, and open the folder you want to use. For this example, I’ll be using C:\code\windowsauth, but you can use anything you choose. You should get the terminal open at the bottom automatically to the folder you are in; if not, use the Terminal > New Terminal command to open the command prompt.
Create a new project with the command:
Once your project is created, you’ll have a ton of new files. The one we’re most concerned with is Startup.cs, as this is where we are going to add most of the code to enable authentication.You’ll want to build and run the application to ensure everything is working properly. You may need to close and reopen VSCode to get it to prompt you to add the build and debug files. Alternatively, you can use the dotnet command line commands to build and run, which are:
Once running, you’ll want to open a web browser (if it didn’t open automatically) and go to https://localhost:5001, and you’ll see this:
Now that we have everything set up and verified working, it’s time to start adding the authentication. First things first, we need to add a NuGet package. In the command prompt open in VSCode, use the following command to add the Microsoft package we need to make it all work:
Next, we want to start adding the code to the Startup.cs file. Open up Startup.cs, and you should see a section labeled “ConfigureServices” and it should be mostly blank right now. We need to tell our application to enable Authentication and Authorization, so you’ll want to add them to the services collection. When you’ve done that, it’ll look like this:
You’ll also need to add a using statement to the top to use the Negotiate functions and constants, so add this to the top of the file:
The last thing we need to add to enable authentication in the code is down in the Configure function. The default template we used adds the line “app.UseAuthorization()” for us already, but we need to tell the app to use our authentication as well. Both the authentication line and authorization lines MUST be between the “app.UseRouting()” line and the “app.UseEndpoints()” line to work. When done, the function should look like this:
Now that we have Authentication all set up, we need to use it in the application somewhere. To accomplish this, we’re going to protect the entire Home Controller on the application because it’ll give us a very easy and quick way to tell everything is working. Open up the HomeController.cs file, located in the Controllers folder. We’re going to add a single line above the class declaration; here is what that will look like when done:
Notice we used a group that doesn’t exist. This is on purpose so we can see it denying us access first, and we’ll know for sure it’s working properly when we fix it. Run your application again; you should see an access denied page:
Now stop the debugger and change that group name to one that exists, and your user is a member of. If you don’t know or aren’t sure, you can print out some of your user details by typing this command in the VS Code terminal window:
This will print out a lot of information about your user, but what we’re looking for is a section labeled “The user is a part of the following security groups” which is a list of every group you are a part of. Pick one of those and replace the “SomeGroupThatDoesntExist” with the one you picked. Now run the application again; you should now see the page instead of an error like you did before:
That’s everything, you now have Windows Authentication running in your development environment! When securing your application, you can do so at the Controller level, which secures everything like my example, or you can do individual actions; the way you do it is exactly the same, just add the line with Authorize above the action and not the controller.
This will have gotten your environment working for local development. It should continue working properly as long as you use a localhost address to run everything. Let’s go over what you need to do for deployment with a real URL and not a localhost one. Note that if you choose to use a real URL for a development environment (like mysitename.com.test or something similar), you’ll have to follow the same directions here to make that work as well. You’ll need to set up and configure your web server that will be running the application. Once done, you’ll want your administrator to run the following command in the command prompt or PowerShell:
Make sure to replace intranet.company.com with the actual address your application will be using and YourServerNameGoesHere with the actual name of the server the application is being deployed to. Without going into the nitty-gritty of what this command actually does, it will authorize the server to access and use permissions from Active Directory, which is what we need. You will also want to ensure you have a security certificate on your site, it’s not required to make everything work, but it is very highly recommended when using authentication of any kind to maintain security.
If you are new to Authentication with .Net, you’ll want to read more on what you can do. Microsoft is usually a pretty good resource on this so the best place to start would be Microsoft’s .Net Documentation on Authentication. If you are interested in learning more about how the authorization side works and the different ways you can implement and use it, start with Microsoft’s .Net Documentation on Authorization.

Keeping Xperience by Kentico Environments in Sync
In software development, we typically employ several environments to offer a separation of features that are currently being developed, tested, approved, and released.
Commonly this involves a 4-tier approach having a development, test, stage, and production environment. The development stage is where all new features are introduced which often involves integrating existing content into that new feature set. One problem with this development cycle is having test content on the dev server that closely resembles content that will actually be used in a production environment. Without an accurate representation of the content, section titles may be too long, images too large or too small, menus too cluttered, and other visual inconsistencies that were not caught in the quality assurance step. For this reason, I recommend some type of periodic synchronization of content. With Xperience by Kentico, there are several approaches that can be used to accomplish this.
Hands down, this is the easiest approach. You select the pages you want to push, click the stage button, and magically your content appears on the target server. The hardest part of using content staging is configuring the servers to talk to each other.
Using the Export wizard, you can export all of the content of a production site into an archive file. This content package can then be uploaded to other environments and imported.
Full database backups are a common way to synchronize environments. Using this method, you can ensure that all the content, well everything, gets its way back down to dev. For example, you can create a data-tier export (bacpac) or create a backup (bak), transfer that to the development server, and restore.
Kentico continuous integration was designed to serialize the data objects from the database into XML files on the file system so you can then add them to a version control system such as git. Typically, this is used between team members to synchronize their databases during development. An advanced use for Kentico CI is syncing content from one environment to another. This can be done by serializing the content on production, copying the files back to development, and running the ContinuousIntegration.exe utility. This process can also be scripted by utilizing the Kentico API.
There are several ways you can use to keep your environments in sync. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and it all depends on which approach will work best for you. For me, using Kentico CI is something I’ve only recently considered using for environment syncs, and it looks very promising.

Localization in GatsbyJS with Kontent.ai
Localization is an effective tool to extend the reach of messages and content on a website to additional audiences outside of the primary language. In a typical application or site, localization is often considered a difficult or complex feature for developers to implement, but with a static site framework like GatsbyJS coupled with a headless CMS like Kontent.ai, localization can be easy to implement.
This article focuses on implementing localization within a GatsbyJS site using Kontent and will not be delving deeply into configuring localization in Kontent itself. The Kontent Docs provides documentation on setting up localization in the CMS under Set up your project languages.
Another assumption that will be made is the use of the gatsby-source-kontent package as the primary method of retrieving data from Kontent and populating the GraphQL queries used in a site. For the purposes of properly communicating language to the client viewing the site, the gatsby-plugin-react-helmet will be used to modify the page structure outside of the site content. The install process and configuration of these packages can be found on their respective pages on the Gatsby package listing.
This article will focus on a “post” content type, which aligns with articles and blog posts, but the same process can be applied to any content type.
Retrieving localized content from Kontent increases the complexity of the static site, as each instance of content will be multiplied by the number of languages configured in Kontent. For example, a site with 50 articles and six languages will have 300 pieces of queried content. The content retrieved for a particular subsection of the site can be reduced by using variables on a normal GraphQL query to filter out content by language, but Gatsby’s static queries do not support variables. As using static queries would require additional handling in JavaScript to filter out all content types, static queries will be avoided. As independent components won’t be able to query for the data used in the component, the content types used for those components, such as navigation or metadata, should be queried for at the same time as other content. Using a “global” content type that holds all global information typically retrieved using static queries can make modeling localizable content more manageable.
To reduce the amount of data available to any particular page and to manage these pages across languages, it is expected that all pages will be created using Gatsby’s Node API (even the index page). The key important difference between a single language site and a multi-language site at this point is the inclusion of an additional GraphQL field provided by Kontent: preferred_language. The language field in the system corresponds to the actual language of the content instance, which will be the default or primary language if it hasn’t been translated.
The query to retrieve articles for page creation might end up looking like the following:
slug and preferred_language are important for the next step: creating the localized page. Gatsby’s createPage function takes an object containing the page path, the template component, and any context data to pass into the page template. Configured using the query above, the createPages API in Gatsby might end up looking like the following:
This will create a page using the article.template.js file for each Article content item, assigning the page path based on the language and the slug, and provide the language variable into the page query associated with the template. After the filters are applied, the data forwarded to the template component will be no different from the data used on a single language site.
In order to communicate with the browser that the particular page is intended to be in a specific language, the lang attribute should be set on the page. One easy way of making the page metadata header available to page generation is through the use of the gatsby-plugin-react-helmet plugin. This is fairly simple to do and can be achieved by using the helmet component with the htmlAttributes prop.
The language code used by the lang attribute is described in RFC 5646: Tags of Identifying Languages. In the event that the language names do not align between Kontent and those considered valid for HTML, mapping those to valid language tags is left as an exercise for the reader. Instances of this may occur when the language code name is the full language name, such as English or Japanese, or when the default language is named default.
One benefit of using Kontent as a headless CMS for a multi-language Gatsby site is that Kontent allows the linking of content types, allowing one content type to contain link to many others, such as a navigation content type containing links, or a banner or featured items content type containing multiple call to action buttons. Intentional structuring of content types can enable reuse of translations across multiple components, such as through a “localization string” content type. In order to make use of these content trees, especially due to the increased overhead of static queries on a multi-language site, one effective approach is to pass the relevant context item from the page template to the components that implement a specific content type. The following will demonstrate how to do this for a hero or featured component with a call to action.
The action_label on the call to action is retrieved from the kontent_item_localization_string, which is an additional component that consists of just a text value that may be used in multiple locations, such as “Subscribe” or “Enroll.” A similar process can be used to query for a global component, which can be used to provide access to content types that are used on all pages, such as headers and footers.
GraphQL can be organized into “fragments”, which act as subsets of queries, in order to make writing page queries, especially when using many common content types, like the localization string content type as mentioned above. Gatsby has condensed the GraphQL documentation into an easy-to-access form, which can be read here.

How BizStream Ensures Delivery of Quality Software
At BizStream, we’ve come a long way in our effort to reduce bugs and repair them quickly when they happen. We have many processes in place to prevent bugs, such as our software development process, automated testing, QA personnel, and error logging software. In this blog post, I’ll break down the many different ways we care about delivering quality software.
The most cost-efficient way to fix a bug is by preventing it in the first place. Typically, the least expensive bug to fix is the bug that is found during requirements gathering. Conversely, the most expensive bug to fix is found on a live production site. In this section, I’ll walk through the many ways we prevent bugs from occurring.
The best way to prevent bugs is by following a proven software development process like Agile Scrum. At BizStream, we follow the Agile Scrum steps on every project. These steps include:
Allows developers to step through code, line by line, to see how it runs. Values can be changed in real-time to simulate possible issues and test out different scenarios.
Developers can add many extensions to help them out, like spell checkers and code completion tools.
Resharper suggests code refactorings that are more performant and less error-prone.
After a developer is assigned a task, they will begin the work on their local computer with an exact copy of the live site you’ll see in your own browser. This gives them the chance to make changes without affecting the production site. We can try new things and test them out on our own without affecting anyone else. Once we’re done making our changes, we make sure the site builds without any errors and then test out the new feature on our own PC. You might think this is standard practice in the industry, but some developers at other companies are changing code on live sites without testing it first, yikes!
Unit tests are automated tests that developers write to test out the smallest chunks of code. Each small piece of code has many small automated tests that are run against it to ensure that each piece of the whole is working correctly. It’s good practice to write tests that cover every possible outcome of each code block and to add new tests after each bug is found and fixed. These tests flush out bugs quickly because developers can run them in large batches after every code change they make. This gives us the confidence we need to change the code without injecting new bugs.
Once we’re done writing our code and testing it locally we make sure the code looks good by proofreading it again before we commit it to the repository. I always review my own code before I commit it, and then I review it again after I submit it for peer review. I’ve found many issues by reviewing my code twice.
Once a developer finishes a task, they create and assign a code review to all other developers on the project team. Team members read the code changes and make comments on any line they choose, just like we can in a Microsoft Word document. Often times we’ll suggest re-using an already existing and tested piece of code instead of writing something new. Or, we’ll simply point out spelling errors or places where the code is likely to fail if an error isn’t handled properly.
At BizStream, we use Cypress, a JavaScript automated test runner. Our Cypress tests verify that the front end of our sites is what we expect it to be on a regular basis. We can run the tests locally as a developer or set them up to run daily against our development sites and live sites.
We also set up a “Crawler” on each site that runs every 24 hours. The crawler provides a report of all the URLs tested along with any errors and warnings that occur. This allows us to track down any bugs we might have created in the previous deployment.
BizStream has a dedicated team of QA professionals. After peer code reviews are finished, the same task is assigned to our QA team. A QA team member will beat it up and find those edge cases we didn’t think about during our developer testing. It’s always good to have a second set of eyes re-read a task’s acceptance criteria and make sure the work is done correctly.
We use Azure DevOps to automate our deployments. Manual deployments are risky, stressful, and time-consuming. When I performed manual deployments in the past, they sometimes took 2 to 4 hours and I had to follow a complicated process step by step or risk taking down a live site. An automated deployment can take 5 minutes or less to complete and can be set up to run at any time without a developer being present. Many live site problems are caused by failed deployments performed by humans. A developer may forget to copy a file over to a production server or forget to run a query to update a database. Sure, there may still be issues every now and then with automated deployments, but when they do arise, we fix the automation problem instead of the deployment problem, and it’s often easier to automate the rollback process, which reduces the overall downtime.Even though our deployments are automated at BizStream, we still watch every live deployment to make sure it runs smoothly. If we need to intervene or restart the process, we’re standing by. Once the code is deployed, the entire team makes sure every new feature is working as expected. We want to be the first to find any new bugs if they are out there.
We utilize multiple different sites for testing before we move our changes to a live production site. These are the usual sites:
Now that we’ve covered some good bug prevention steps, we’ll talk about how we find live bugs and record them, so our clients and users don’t have to.
The Kentico Xperience Content Management System (CMS) has its own built-in event log. It’s good to skim through the log on a regular basis to make sure a site is running well. Errors are conveniently highlighted in red with dates, custom error messages, and sometimes even the exact line number where the bug occurred in the code. Our YouthCenter and CaseStream products utilize their own custom event logs that are crucial in helping us figure out what’s causing a bug.
Audit logs are used to determine who created, viewed, edited, or deleted items on a site. The Xperience CMS stores this information in the event log. BizStream’s products implement their own version of an audit log. They help us figure out the “who, what, when, and where” of a bug before we start troubleshooting.
Windows servers store IIS logs that can be used by developers to figure out issues when they arise when nothing is logged in the Event Log or Audit Log.
If you press your F12 button in your browser and view the console tab, there may be errors listed in red. Sometimes the errors are specific enough that we’ll know exactly what the problem is without doing any further digging.
It’s often helpful to run an automated service that sends some sort of notification message to the development team when errors occur. If needed, we can respond right away to an issue and solve it before more users find it.
If you’re running the Xperience by Kentico CMS, you can add an e-mail address to the “Error notification e-mail address” setting in the administration part of the site. You will then receive e-mails when errors occur.
BizStream also utilizes RayGun on non-Xperience sites. RayGun is a software product that provides error monitoring, crash reporting, user monitoring, and real-time performance metrics. We have it set up to send us Slack messages whenever errors occur on our sites, so we never miss one.
The Xperience CMS provides many different tools out of the box for reporting and logging errors. However, some of our clients want a little more than what Kentico gives them. As a result, BizStream added the Toolkit for Kentico. The Toolkit contains many software tools that enhance the Xperience CMS like Sitewide Search, Compare for Kentico Deployments, and Connect for integrating with CRM tools like ZoHo and Dynamics. However, two software packages in the Toolkit can help reduce issues on your site.
Constant Care automates the review of over 100 points of performance on a Kentico Xperience site and gives easy-to-follow instructions to get a site performing at its fullest.
The Siteimprove add-on is an integration between Siteimprove and Kentico Xperience that streamlines workflow efficiencies for a web team. With this extension installed, a team can fix errors and optimize content directly within the editing environment. Once the detected issues have been assessed, they can be re-checked on the relevant page in real-time to determine if further actions are needed.
Finally, we need to realize that bugs are unavoidable on live sites. It’s nearly impossible to prevent all of them. The key is to gather all the relevant information from the available sources and fix the issue as fast as possible. The more information we get from our clients and users in our support e-mails, the quicker we can solve the problem. After we collect the information and fix the bug, we follow the same process as outlined above in the Bug Prevention section of this post before updating the live site again with the fix. Ensuring quality is a team effort that starts with prevention, continues with the use of logging and error reporting tools, and finishes with quick response times from everyone on the team when errors do occur.

Custom Task Conditions in Azure Pipelines
Azure Pipelines is an Azure DevOps service that allows anyone to easily build, test, and deploy with CI/CD. These pipelines offer a ton of customization on their own with hundreds of available build tasks (steps), countless integrations, and triggers based on other builds completing or a set schedule. When it comes to customizing the pipeline tasks, however, things get a little more complicated.
What if you only want to run a specific pipeline task on Mondays? What if you want to run certain tasks if the build was kicked off manually? What if you have a custom variable and want to run a task based on its value? All of these situations are made possible by the use of custom conditions in Azure Pipelines. This useful setting is hidden away on each pipeline task and will unlock customization options for all your needs.
To start off, there are a few easy steps we need to follow:
Note: For this tutorial, I am using the Classic UI in Azure instead of YAML. If you are using YAML, the general approach should be similar enough to follow along. Let’s continue!
Now that we have our pipeline open and in edit mode, let’s familiarize ourselves with the custom condition setting:
Note: The “Run this task” selector has some predefined options that allow for some basic customization. For example, you can select “Only when a previous task has failed” if you want the task to only run if the build fails. One use for this would be if you want to send a Slack message to your team notifying them of the failure. For more in-depth customization, I recommend using the “Custom conditions” option, as it makes the possibilities virtually endless.
Azure has some great documentation on custom conditions, and they even give some useful examples to get you started. Reading through the examples will help you understand the expressions and how they are constructed. If you still have questions after looking at the examples, check out the documentation on expressions within Azure DevOps to understand the syntax for variables, functions, and more.
As we continue, I will show off some specific examples of useful custom conditions and then show you how to unlock even more possibilities with custom conditions paired with PowerShell scripts.
For each example, I will give a brief explanation of what the custom condition does and then show the syntax. Feel free to skip to the example that suits your needs or scroll to the PowerShell section for maximum customization, like running a task on a specific day of the week.
Explanation: You only want to run a task if one of your pipeline variables is set to false.
Example: Run a task when system debug is set to false.
Custom Condition:
Explanation: You only want to run a task when a variable equals a specific value.
Example: Send a Slack message if your notifications variable is set to public.
Custom Condition:
Explanation: You only want to run a task if the build is queued manually through the Azure Pipelines UI or via the Azure API.Example: Update the npm packages each time the build is run manually.Custom Condition:
Explanation: You only want to run a task when the build is queued via a schedule that is set on the Triggers tab.Example: Publish the test results when the build is run on a schedule so that the number of results is consistent each week.Custom Condition:
Explanation: If the above options don’t provide enough customization, PowerShell scripting may be your answer. A PowerShell script in your pipeline allows you to generate a variable and set its value to anything you want. You can get the value from an API call, function, date formatter, etc. After creating the variable, you can use it in your task’s custom condition and run or ignore the task based on its value.Set Up:
Example: Run a task only on Mondays that deletes the previous week’s cached files.PowerShell Script:
Custom Condition:
The above examples are just a small preview of all the possibilities that custom conditions bring to Azure Pipelines. If you are passionate about customization, I am sure you will find even more unique ways of customizing pipelines to fit your needs. Thanks to Microsoft’s great documentation and examples, I was able to quickly learn about this feature and find practical uses for it in my daily work.Did you know about custom conditions before reading this article? How do you plan on using custom conditions to improve your build pipelines? Are you still having issues with understanding this feature? We are here to help, and we love feedback, so please send us an email with your comments or questions. Happy customizing!

Part III: Using the BizStream Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Packages
In Part I: An Introduction to ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages, we explored how the ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages Middleware can be used to provide user-friendly error pages from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree. We expanded upon this implementation in Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware to support Page Routing via a custom Request Delegate. In this conclusion to the Error Page in Kentico Xperience series, we’ll explore the BizStream/xperience-status-code-pages repository, and how the two NuGet packages BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages & BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages  published from it, can be used to quickly get started with StatusCodePages powered by Kentico Xperience.
BizStream maintains two NuGet packages that can be used for quickly spinning up StatusCodePages in an Xperience solution:
BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages: Contains an object archive defining a StatusCodeNode, akin to the HttpErrorNode described in previous parts of this series, and a Module that auto-imports the included object archive, thus importing the StatusCodeNode Page Type object into the target EMS solution.
BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages: Contains the StatusCodePages middleware, a default controller and view, and extension methods to use Kentico Xperience-powered StatusCodePage in an ASP.NET Core MVC project.
To begin with Xperience StatusCodePages, the BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages package must be installed into the CMSApp project, using the “Install NuGet Packages” option within Visual Studio, or using the Package Manager Console:
Install-Package BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.Adminstration.StatusCodePages
Upon installing the Administration NuGet package, a CMSSiteUtils/Import/BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip file should now be visible within the Solution Explorer (if not, you may need to Show All Files in the project), this Object Archive contains the Page Types & Form Controls needed to manage Error Pages within the Pages application.
To finalize the installation of the Object Archive, start a new Debug session or execute Kentico CI against the target CMSApp. This will result in the initialization of the StatusCodePagesModule, which will execute the registered IStatusCodePagesImportProvider implementation to automatically import objects within the BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip archive.
If Kentico CI was run, XML files for the StatusCodeNode Page Type, among other object types, should now exist in the CI Repository folder, or if a Debug session was run, the Event Log can be checked for errors from the StatusCodePagesImportProvider. After successfully importing objects, as indicated by the Event Log, the BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip file can be deleted locally and removed from the CMSApp.csproj.
The Administration package contains build .props/.targets files that ensure the BizStream_StatusCodePages.zip archive is included in MSBuild Publish artifacts. This ensures the file exists when promoting the CMSApp through environments when using WebDeploy / Visual Studio Publish Profiles. When installing the Adminstration package, NuGet adds references to these .props/.targets files within the CMSApp.csproj.
With the Administration package installed and initialized, StatusCodeNodes can now be added to the Content Tree within the Pages application:
If the StatusCodeNode is not visible in the “Add Page” menu, it may need to be manually assigned to the correct Site within the “Page Types” application.
After installing the Administration package into the CMSApp, the BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages must be installed into the Xperience ASP.NET Core MVCMvc project:
dotnet add package BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages
OR
<PackageReference Include=" BizStream.Kentico.Xperience.AspNetCore.StatusCodePages" Version="x.x.x" />
Upon installing the AspNetCore NuGet package, the Startup.cs must be updated to add required services, and to configure the middleware:
Finally, the StatusCodeNode must be registered for Page Routing with Kentico. The AspNetCore package provides a default Controller & View that can be registered using the RegisterStatusCodePageRouteAttribute:
BizStream recommends creating a RegisterPageRoutes.cs file in the root of your MVC project. Additionally, BizStream recommends segmenting Kentico Xperience-related components of the MVC site in a Razor Class Library, for example, refer to the MVC.Kentico.Xperience Class Library in BizStream/xperience-blog-template.
Alternatively, if you require greater control, the base RegisterPageRouteAttribute provided by the Kentico API can be used for registering the route, for example:
With the packages installed, and a “Not Found” page configured in the Content Tree, debugging the MVC site in a mode other than Development and navigating to an invalid path shall yield a page from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree:

Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware
In Part I: An Introduction to ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages, we explored ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages and how we can use this middleware provided by the framework to produce user-friendly error pages from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree using a custom Controller. In this predecessor to Part I, we’ll dip our toes into the waters of the ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages source to implement a custom Request Delegate Middleware, allowing support for Page Routing.
As recommended by Microsoft, we’ll start implementing our Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware by defining an extension method that targets IApplicationBuilder, to expose the usage of UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func<StatusCodeContext,Task>) to configure the StatusCodePages middleware.We’ll start our implementation with the WithRedirects extension:
If the path of an HttpErrorNode can be retrieved via GetErrorNodePathAsync, we instruct the response to redirect to the retrieved path. In GetErrorNodePathAsync, we use the IErrorPageRetriever from Part I to retrieve an HttpErrorNode for the current response, and Kentico’s IPageUrlRetriever to retrieve the path for the respective HttpErrorNode. By using Kentico’s IPageUrlRetriever, our Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware will automatically support the HttpErrorNode's configured Page Routing behavior.To learn more about the details of Kentico’s IPageUrlRetriever service, check out Sean G. Wright’s excellent piece “Bits of Xperience: The Hidden Cost of IPageUrlRetriever.Retrieve“.That static GetErrorNodePathAsync method though, kind of gross. Just as was done with the ErrorController example from Part I, a “Retriever” service can be defined to make the implementation more concise and extensible.
Add our service to the IServiceCollection in the Startup, and we’ve once again made our code a bit more concise.
The ASP.NET Core source code for the UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute extension method on GitHub shall serve as a solid reference for how to support ReExecute functionality. Reviewing the source code, there are 4 lines of particular interest:
These 4 lines format the string arguments passed to UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute that create the path to ReExecute the request pipeline on. We can base our implementation off of the framework’s source for UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute, replacing these four lines with a call to our GetErrorNodePathAsync method. This will ensure that our custom Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware’s behavior is compatible with the behavior of the StatusCodePages Middleware when using UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute out-of-the-box, ensuring additional middleware in the request pipeline that may depend on the IStatusCodeReExecuteFeature will continue to behave correctly, just as expected.
The next step is to register the HttpErrorNode for Kentico Xperience Page Routing, refactoring the ErrorController to use Kentico’s IPageDataContextRetriever.
@Model.Heading
@Model.Content
Finally, update the Startup.cs to use our desired Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages middleware behavior:
Requests to the MVCMvc site at paths that produce a 404: Not Found status code will now return the Content and Heading from an HttpErrorNode where HttpStatusCode = 404:
Page Not Found

In Part III: Using the BizStream Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Packages, we’ll dig into the BizStream/xperience-status-code-pages repository, and how the NuGet packages published from it can be used to quickly get started using StatusCodePages powered by Kentico Xperience.

https://bizstream.com/blog/part-2-implementing-kentico-xperience-statuscodepages-middleware/

Part I: An Introduction to ASP.NET StatusCodePages
In almost every MVC site I’ve developed on the Kentico Xperience Platform, there has been one feature that has never quite felt “right”: Error Pages.
Whether it’s due to confusing configuration (looking at you, System.Web), awkward routing and redirects in controllers, or multiple, sometimes ambiguous, patterns for handling exceptions (looking at you again, System.Web), creating user-friendly error pages in Kentico Xperience MVC sites don’t always seem straight-forward.
It’s time for a reckoning.
In this 3-part series, we’ll be covering the background to BizStream’s xperience-status-code-pages packages, reviewing how the ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages pattern can be extended to serve user-friendly error pages from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree.
Within the ASP.NET Core framework, StatusCodePages is a pattern for providing a response body, based on the response’s status code.
The StatusCodePages pattern provides a variety of IApplicationBuilder extension methods that configure the behavior of the underlying middleware, and allow developers some options as to how the response should be handled. Of these extension methods, UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute is particularly attractive, as it allows developers to specify a path upon which to re-execute the request pipeline.
An advantage to “ReExecute” over “Redirect”, is that the original URL is preserved in the client. A request to /not-a-real-url that produces a 404: Not Found status code is returned to the requested URL, /not-a-real-url, rather than redirecting the client to /error?code=404. If you’re a veteran ASP.NET developer with IIS Rewrite Module experience: a “ReExecute” is similar to a “Rewrite”, as opposed to a “Redirect”
For Example:
An additional advantage to this pattern is that in other controllers, the base Controller.NotFound method can be used, as opposed to redirecting to a custom “NotFound” action:
The RedirectToAction( "NotFound", "Error" ) is a common pattern I often see in Kentico Xperience MVC sites, wherein the NotFound action queries the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for some type of NotFoundNode.
In many cases, we’d like to give Content Editors the ability to manage the content of Error Pages. This can be achieved by building upon the ErrorController from the previous example to query and serve content from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree:
That’s quite a bit of query logic in the controller…
We can clean that up by defining a service to compose the IPageRetriever usage and query logic. We’ll try to work with Kentico’s “Page Retrievers” pattern here by defining an IErrorPageRetriever that describes the retrieval of an HttpErrorNode:
Add our services to the IServiceCollection in the Startup, and the ErrorController is a bit more concise.
All of this is nice, except for one. little. thing. /error?code={0}. All of the error pages are accessed at the /error path with a query string, Yuck! An ideal solution would allow us to use Page Routing to give Content Editors the ability to configure the URLs of the error pages, just like any other node in the Content Tree. Page Routing would also give greater flexibility to support Redirect or ReExecute behaviors.
We are now presented with a new problem: UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute and UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects require a specific path string that must be known when Startup.Configure(IApplicationBuilder) is invoked and the UseStatusCodePages* method is called. In order to make Page Routing work, the StatusCodePages middleware requires a means of dynamically querying the Content Tree for the PageUrl of the expected HttpErrorNode in which the request should Redirect to or ReExecute.
Unfortunately, neither of the WithRedirects or WithReExecute extensions provide overloads that would allow dynamic retrieval of the path to Redirect to or ReExecute on. There is still hope, however, thanks to the UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func<StatusCodeContext,Task>) overload. This overload allows a Func<StatusCodeContext, Task> delegate to be passed, which effectively functions as a Request Delegate via the StatusCodeContext.
In Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware, we’ll explore how UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func<StatusCodeContext,Task>) can be used to implement our own WithRedirects/WithReExecute extension methods that query the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for the PageUrl to Redirect to or ReExecute on, in a manner that is compatible with the behavior of the extensions provided by the framework.

Four Dos and Don’ts of Website Discovery
A modern website should be clean, simple, and easy to use, right? Well, just like there is a ton going on behind the scenes in even the simplest moment of your favorite TV show, a simple website is likely anything but under the surface.
There is an endless number of questions and scenarios to think through when planning a new site or a rebuild of a current one. For example, does this form need to connect to CRM? Where is the data for this list of clients coming from? What in the world actually happens when you click this button?
It can be intimidating to attempt to capture all of that information so that, 12 months later, when your team is finishing up that last feature, you still remember what it’s supposed to do. That’s why I wanted to share some of my hard-won-by-making-all-the-mistakes experience with you and hopefully make your next discovery project that much more effective.
This first one seems obvious but can be more challenging than you might realize. Why?  Because oftentimes, it’s easy for us to categorize some things as “small or trivial” when in reality, they end up becoming very important down the road during implementation.
We’re constantly taking in information from everything around us; way more than our brain can process, so it prunes out information it doesn’t see as important, so you can focus on what is. (Fun fact, did you know that your nose is in your field of vision all the time, but your brain just edits it out, so you don’t see it? Weird, right?). With that level of experience editing information as it comes in, you would think we’d be pretty good at it, but unfortunately, that skill doesn’t quite transfer here. So my rule is to write down way more than I think I should. I can’t tell you the number of times some random off-handed remark that I jotted down was the answer to a question we had weeks or even months later.
Of course, you can’t get it all. Unless you’re a court stenographer, writing everything down is hard and, if you’re doing that, you likely don’t have much bandwidth left over to think through and respond to what is being said. You know the “analyze” part of the Business Analyst title? So if you miss something, don’t beat yourself up. Just make sure to always, always, ALWAYS record the meetings, so you can go back and review them later, remembering that digging through hours of stale conference calls can be time-consuming, so consider it more of a last resort.
More data is only better when it’s the right data. Otherwise, you’re just creating your very own proverbial haystack for yourself to find the proverbial needle in. Thinking through the architecture and taxonomy of your documentation is as important as the architecture and taxonomy of the project itself. Obviously, it is extremely important for a developer to know what a feature needs to do. However, knowing the strategy about why the client decided on that particular shade of blue for the background color of the feature is likely not.
Keep every shred of information you gather filed away somewhere, but be mindful about overwhelming people with lots of information irrelevant to what they need to do. It usually just leads to confusion and opportunities for varying interpretations. As you may be able to tell from this blog post, I rarely use 1 word when 20 will do. That’s not usually a good idea when providing information to a developer to complete a task. Context is great, but it’s rarely necessary to read the whole novel to know how they need the contact form wired up.
I was going to suggest a drinking game where you take a shot for every one of the tools above that you’ve used in the last year, but I care about your safety. Those of us of a certain age might be familiar with the phrase “The truth is out there” from the X-Files. That search for the truth was compelling for a TV show but should not be a feature in your documentation.
So you’ve written down as much as you can. You’ve organized all your notes and recordings. You’ve distilled that information down to focused tasks without too much fluff in their descriptions. But, ultimately, there needs to be a single place that documents the way things are going to work. At BizStream we utilize Jira. Discovery notes and internal meetings turn into tickets and, once the client approves the tickets, those become law. My notes are still there for reference and context, but the Jira ticket trumps everything else (again, once approved by the client).
That doesn’t mean there won’t be external documentation that fills out the information on the tickets. Things such as designs, sanitized test data, and other items that don’t make sense to add to the Jira ticket live in our shared Google Drive. The key here is to link those assets directly to the ticket. That way, there is no question about which design, flowchart, etc., applies to this exact task.
OR
OR
After spending so much time talking about how things should work, taking notes, documenting final decisions, distilling that information into actionable tasks, etc., it might feel a little, well, embarrassing to ask the client for more information. Especially when you know it’s something you previously discussed, but it didn’t make it to the documentation for one reason or another.
In development, we know that doing your best to hit all the acceptance criteria right the first time is far more efficient. Otherwise, you can get into a cycle of back and forth with QA finding bugs and sending them back to the developer, the developer fixing them and sending them back to QA, and then QA spending time re-evaluating those bugs. That is all with the specifics clearly defined and rock solid! Why make a guess, however, educated, at what the client wanted on a certain feature rather than just confirming it with them? Does that mean emailing the client 12 times a day? No. After all is said and done, though, the client is the one paying for something to be built the way they want it to be. So make sure everyone knows what that is.
So none of these concepts are exactly groundbreaking research. They are all pretty common sense things you may have looked at and thought, “duh” (people still say “duh”, right?). My experience, however, has been that we all need reminding from time to time. Things get busy, we fall into bad habits, we get lazy, and so on. There are even times when we think we’re doing a certain practice well but, when you really stop to think of it, you realize it was more of an… ideal you had in your mind rather than something you’re actually doing. Sometimes it takes hearing something you’ve heard before one last time before it finally clicks into place. Whatever the case may be, I hope you found something useful.

Creating a reCAPTCHA v3 Custom Form Component in Xperience MVC
Let’s say you want to safeguard your site’s forms from spam by utilizing reCAPTCHA v3 so that you don’t have to render the reCAPTCHA challenge in your nicely designed form that you built with Xperience’s Form Builder. Enter custom form components. Custom form components allow you to define new form components that can be used by content administrators when building new forms in Form Builder. In this blog post, I will show you how we can leverage custom form components to add google’s reCAPTCHA v3 via client-side code and validate the key that is returned by the reCAPTCHA API on the server side.
Most of the general setup for creating a custom form component is outlined in the Xperience documentation, so if you are looking to create other custom form components, that is a good place to start. For this blog post, I will be showing specifically how to implement a reCAPTCHA v3 custom form component.
The first step will be to create a folder called “FormComponents” to hold all the classes related to your custom form component(s). This needs to be at the root of your Web project, ~/Models/FormComponents.
Next, create a “FormComponentProperties” folder within the “FormComponents” (/Models/FormComponents/FormComponentProperties) folder and then create a new InvisibleReCaptchaV3Properties properties class.
Here are a couple of things to note about the code snippet below.
SettingsKeyInfoProvider.GetValue("reCaptchaV3SiteKey", SiteContext.CurrentSiteID) is using CMS.DataEngine to retrieve custom site settings that are defined in the Xperience admin. To create these custom settings, navigate to the Modules application in the Xperience admin. If you don’t already have a Custom module for your site, create one. Edit the Custom module and go to Settings in the left sidebar. Once you are in the Settings, create a “New settings group” titled reCAPTCHA v3 Keys (or whatever you would like to call it) and within that group, create two new settings keys with code names reCaptchaV3SiteKey and reCaptchaV3SecretKey. The code name of these settings keys needs to match the first parameter that you pass to the SettingsKeyInfoProvider.GetValue:
Next, we will create a partial view, which is responsible for rendering the form component. In our case, we are only using the form input to hold the reCAPTCHA token value. Since the user does not need to see or know about the reCAPTCHA token, we will add a hidden class to hide the input from view.
We will then use the value of the input (which will be the reCAPTCHA token) on the server side to validate the token. This is also where we will add the JavaScript that will programmatically invoke the reCAPTCHA challenge. If you would like to read more about reCAPTCHA or need to know how to get a reCAPTCHA site key and secret key, here is a link to Google’s reCAPTCHA documentation.
Next, you will want to create a new JavaScript file that will hold all of our logic for registering the reCAPTCHA. If you follow along in the JavaScript, the first thing we do when the window loads is call the getFormOnSubmitFunction and removeFormOnSubmitFunction functions. Those calls then get the value of the inline onsubmit function that is on the <form> element, sets it to a window object property to be referenced later, and then removes it from the form component. This allows us to programmatically invoke the reCAPTCHA challenge and validate the token before the Xperience form is submitted. We also add an event listener to listen for submit events. When a submit event occurs, the onClick function is called. This function contains the code that programmatically invokes the reCAPTCHA challenge.
Be sure to add this JavaScript file to your partial view that is responsible for rendering all of your site-wide JavaScript bundles in the footer of the HTML.
If the grecaptcha.execute() method is successful, it returns a reCAPTCHA token. We need to validate this token on the server side. In order to have access to that token, we set it to the value of the reCAPTCHA custom form component input that we created. Since we created a new validation rule (see “Create a New Validation Rule” section), as long as we select this validation rule in Form Builder, the Validate() method will get called with the input’s value passed in.
One thing to note here is that we are adding a hidden class to the input. You can name your class whatever you would like or use an existing utility class that you have. This hidden class adds display: none to the input so that the element is not displayed and has no effect on the layout of the page.
At the root of your Web project, create a ReCaptchaV3Validation.cs file. This file will go in a new ~/FormBuilder/ValidationRules folder. This creates a new validation rule that is available to select for a form component in Form Builder. When the form is submitted, the Validate() method will be called with the input’s value passed in. The value is the reCAPTCHA token that we can pass to the reCAPTCHA API, along with your site secret key. If the validation is successful, google returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0. 0 being that the interaction on your site was very likely a bot, and 1.0 indicating that the interaction was very good and is most likely a human. That’s it! The only step left is to add your new custom form component to a form in Xperience Form Builder.
The last step of the process is to add your new form component to a form on your site via Form Builder. Navigate to the Forms application in the Xperience admin, create a new form or edit an existing one, and click on Form Builder. Click on the “+” button to add a new form component. You should see your new form component listed here; select it. Next, click on the Validation tab in the right sidebar, and you should see the custom validation rule you created previously in the dropdown menu. You now have a fully functioning reCAPTCHA v3 implementation that is invisible to the user but protects your form from bots!

Allendale Tech Company Now Running on Solar Power
BizStream, a tech company located just outside Grand Rapids, Michigan, recently added solar panels to its commercial rooftop. The web-based solutions company selected Tiger Solar, a national solar contractor with an office in Comstock Park, Mich., to custom design and install the solar array. Tiger Solar installed 224 solar modules to BizStream’s rooftop over a two-month period. The 86.275kW system is expected to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce 88,977kW annually.
BizStream’s Founder and Developer, Mark Schmidt, connected with Tiger Solar while researching local solar contractors for his personal residence. After Tiger Solar successfully installed a 9.3kW system on Mr. Schmidt’s home, he recommended that BizStream invest in solar to reduce fossil fuel consumption and lower utility bills.
Tiger Solar was a fantastic partner in the process of making the switch to solar. They worked closely with us to take advantage of various tax incentives and grants, provided an easy-to-understand game plan and gave us detailed monthly predictions on the amount of energy that we could harness with our particular setup.
“Environmental impact was one of the most significant factors in our decision to switch to solar energy. We love that solar energy directly reduces the amount of stress we put on our planet. We want to lead by example within our industry and inspire others to reduce their carbon footprint,” added Lentz.
Chad Becker, Branch Manager in Grand Rapids, oversaw the project from conception to completion, ensuring that BizStream was satisfied with their switch to solar.
It was a pleasure completing the residential install for Mr. Schmidt and helping him take this big step towards clean energy for his business. We are thrilled to see so many commercial businesses in the Grand Rapids area making this investment that we know will reap benefits for years to come.

Enhancing Page Builder Widgets With Custom Web Components in Kentico Xperience
One of the many great features of Kentico is being able to create custom widgets for use in page builder, and there are several ways to implement custom behavior in those widgets. One way that we at BizStream have found to enhance widget behavior on the client-side is through custom Web Components.
Web components are, in the simplest sense, custom HTML elements that are written and implemented in JavaScript. They are similar to components in Angular, React, Vue, etc., except they are built-in for all modern browsers. There is a wealth of information on web components on MDN, and I highly recommend reading their documentation.
There are a few reasons why you might want to use web components to enhance your widgets in Kentico.First of all, there is no build step required. If you are used to using a framework like Angular and React, you know a lot goes into setting up the project. With web components, all you need to start is JavaScript code.Another benefit is progressive enhancement. Web components, when implemented correctly, will allow adding functionality to a web page, but in such a way as to not break the functionality of the web page if JavaScript is disabled and will not hinder a page’s accessibility.Finally, web components give the developer a way to encapsulate functionality fully within the custom component, using the Shadow DOM, and allows a Kentico widget to easily pass options from the server-side to the client-side through attributes.
To demonstrate all this, we will make a custom pager component which can be added to a listing widget.
Start by creating a listing widget. Creating new widgets in Kentico is well documented here, but here is a sample piece of code that could be used to get a listing of articles using a C# View Component:
Then in our view component markup, we could have something like this:
Article Listing
Note the <listing-pager> element. That is our custom component which we will create next
To create the pager web component, first add a javascript file and make sure it is imported in the site. To start, we will declare a class for our component and implement the base element class, making sure to implement a constructor. We will also scaffold out the rest of the methods to be implemented later.
There are quite a few methods here, so let’s get started! We will implement each method in turn. To start, we will implement the constructor.
Next, we will implement the method that will query the “Per Page” attribute from the markup. We are implementing this method as a class getter to simplify its usage in the rest of the code.
Next are the “lifecycle” methods for our custom element. First, the connectedCallback method will be used to set up events and anything else that needs initialization in our element.
The disconnectedCallback method will be used for any and all cleanup we need to do for our element.
Now, we will get into the meat of our component and implement the main events and functionality. The first event we will set is for when a selected page changes.
Next comes the event for when content is added or removed to the slot within out custom element.
The following two methods are utility methods for adding or removing buttons for selecting the current page. In the addPageButton method we will manually set the IDs and the data-page attributes for each button and use these in other methods. Since we have control of each button and its functionality in our element, we can safely make some assumptions and implement our own desired way things should work and interact, but best practices should always be followed, and the inner workings of our element should always be documented, especially since we have so much control of the code.
The removePageButton will query for the button corresponding to the method’s input, clean it up and remove it from our button list.
There are only two methods left! They hold the code for updating the content and buttons in our element, so let us dive into each one.The next method we will implement is for updating the buttons. As seen earlier this will be called when content is added or removed from the slot, including any content already inside the slot in existing markup. This method will validate and calculate the number of pages based on the desired amount of items per page and add or remove buttons from our element accordingly.
The final method will update the visibility of the slotted content based on the current page that has been selected.
Our element is finally complete, but there is one final step to make the Web Component usable. We need to register our custom element so that the DOM knows what it is. Here is how we do that.
With that, our element has been defined and we can use it on any page where the above code is imported or defined. There is quite a bit of code here, but the main goal here is to demonstrate how a larger custom element might be defined and implemented. At this point, there are also some things that need to be improved upon. For instance, if per-page is larger than the number of children there will still always be one page button created even though a button is not needed for only one page of content. There is also no styling which can be added in a style element explicitly and attached to the shadowRoot. But, in general, for a small to average amount of items this pager should work great.
One final thing to highlight is that having a new slotted custom element opens up several other opportunities. Not only can this be used to enhance Page Builder widgets, but this can also be used to enhance Page Builder sections as well! Using the pager we have already defined, we can use it just as easily to add paging to an entire section like this:
Using this same idea, we can define and implement tabbed content in a section:
The full implementation of tabs in the above example is quite a bit more complex, and I might revisit this idea in a future post.
With the flexibility and functionality that Web Components provide, we wind up with a lot of options and power at our fingertips. I hope this post has sparked some interest in looking deeper into Web Components and how they can be used, not only in Kentico but anywhere on the web.

How to Onboard New Team Members in a Virtual Workplace
While the last 15 months introduced many unique challenges to the workforce, we recently had to address how to onboard multiple new staff members.
Before the pandemic, Bizstream had a hybrid work schedule that offered employees the option to be in the office three days a week and work from home the other two. We had never been in a situation where not only was a new hire going to be remote, but the rest of the staff was as well. We wanted to ensure that all new hires felt immediately welcome and part of a team and were not lost in the shuffle or felt disconnected, which we already monitored with our existing employees. We did a few things that made an immediate impact, and overall, the feedback we received from the new hires is that the onboarding process was well beyond what they expected.
One of the first things we did before day one was to compile the gear each new hire needed, along with a few extras. We found a time where they could meet us at the office and, even though it was practically empty, get a tour of the space and leave with their equipment and some fun swag. We wanted to give them a sense of what they, one day soon, would hopefully be walking into (what can we say, we love our space). We also provided some books that we use to help our team understand our culture and how we like to operate.
While we provide a laptop, we also were mindful of the situation and tried to provide any other ancillary materials that would help them set up a workspace that would be close to what they would have in the office, including monitors, cables, keyboard, and mouse. Lastly, their gear package includes our LAB book, or “Life at BizStream.”
The LAB book is a collection of information about what someone new can expect at BizStream. It includes common things specific to our culture, like how to use Sonos, helpful Slack channels, special time tracking notes, planned holidays, office events, etc. It is something we provide to someone on their first day in the office, but even as people are remote, we think it still helps team members get to know BizStream and our unique culture even without experiencing it firsthand.
Another thing we like to provide before someone starts is a detailed agenda for their first day. We figure that starting a new job is already a little bit stressful, and having some idea of what to expect that first day will look like provides some comfort. The same goes with working fully remote. We don’t want someone sitting at their computer not knowing who or when someone would reach out to tell them whatever comes next. Actually, you can read more about a new hire’s first day here.
We also like to kick off each new hire day with a team meeting where we introduce the entire staff. We’ve been able to have some fun with this! To get it to go smoothly, we have a list of every team member in order of years they’ve been at Bizstream (down to two decimal places) or days in the office. On top of that, we’ve incorporated some fun icebreakers for each person to include, such as “What is your favorite superhero?” “What is your dream car?” or “What is your favorite stompy mech movie/game/comic/manga?”
On their first day, we present them with their onboarding plan. While this is also something that we have provided pre-COVID, we made sure to spend more time on it and detail it as much as possible. It spans a new hire’s first three months and provides a clear list of expectations and milestone dates for achieving them. It includes our core values, what their position is accountable and responsible for, key meetings, and provided training. We treat it as a bit of a living document that the manager reviews with the new hire every week and determines if things are on track or if we need to make some adjustments. If both parties agree that a change is needed, it is noted in the onboarding plan, and we move forward.
One of the changes we made to our process is scheduling meetings throughout the first few weeks so that the new team members could spend some time with each team or department and get to know each other better. We were missing out on the in-office opportunities of saying hello when getting coffee or grabbing lunch together, so we decided to be more intentional about getting people together. As we are starting to move back into the office fully, we decided this is something we should keep going. Previously, we have had people that wouldn’t have the opportunity to work with another team, so getting them connected and talking early on feels like a no-brainer at this point.
The last thing we did to make new hires feel welcome is organize a parking lot party. Following the latest government mandates at the time, we would optionally invite everyone to the office and have chairs, some drinks, pre-packaged snacks, and hang out from a short distance (you all know the drill by now) in our parking lot. While it worked fine to do everything virtually, there is still something to be said for face-to-face communication. It was good to bring people together (while separate) for some social interaction and get to know each other in person.
We really like to hear from our new team members so we can figure out what we are doing right and what we could improve on. So far, we have received great feedback regarding our revised onboarding process, with some saying it was the best they’ve seen. We are looking forward to our next round of onboarding, which looks hopeful of taking place in person. We are looking forward to incorporating a lot of what we learned during our fully remote environment into our normal onboarding process.

The Scoop on WCAG 3.0
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the first public draft of the W3C Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3 earlier this year. While the new guidelines are in the process of being tweaked based on public feedback, the overall goal is to provide easy-to-understand guidelines that strengthen support for broader needs, including diverse cognitive abilities and disabilities.
We wanted to take a fresh look at what was needed in accessibility guidelines. We worked with academic and corporate researchers to identify priorities. We brought together industry leaders in a design sprint to brainstorm new approaches. We spent years proposing, debating, and discarding prototypes until we agreed on this draft.
The new guidelines provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities by encouraging better experience for:
While nothing is set in stone yet, we have a good idea of what’s to come. There are only five guidelines in WCAG 3 so far. Each guideline was selected to demonstrate a feature of the new structure. They are still being worked through and will most likely change in a future version. As of now, they are as follows:
Broader testing methods are set to be implemented with the rollout of WCAG 3. These new testing methods will consider all five categories of disability (vision, auditory process, physical ability, cognitive ability, and speech). We can expect these scoring methods to include:
Testing is based on user journeys instead of testing sample pages, enabling more flexible conformance.
Levels A, AA, and AAA will be replaced by a new conformance rating that is designed to encourage teams to improve continuously. The new conformance levels are:
If your score is high enough in each disability category, then you achieve Bronze level. We expect that Bronze level will be the level recommended for regulations.
So, how soon do you and your team need to take action? Thankfully, we have a lot of time to prepare. WCAG 3 is a rough first draft, and it will likely be years before it is finalized. While it will eventually replace WCAG 2 when it is complete, it’s expected that WCAG 2 will remain valid even after WCAG 3 has officially launched. In the meantime, it’s recommended to concentrate on meeting WCAG 2.1 and keep an eye on WCAG 2.2, which is expected to be released in the summer of 2021.
This is just a high-level overview of what’s expected when WCAG 3 rolls out. For a more detailed look, check out W3C’s first public working draft.

Want New Members? Make Sure Your Website Does This.
Attracting new members is a top priority for all associations and member-based organizations (MBOs). Trouble is, convincing them that you’re worth their time and money.
How, then, can you grow your membership base? What’s the secret to effective membership recruitment?
By telling a better story and building a better website, you can convert interested prospects into new, engaged members.
Effective association membership marketing is easier said than done, though. That’s why in this blog, you’ll find helpful insights like:
The pandemic exposed how much associations and MBOs rely on events, both for revenue and recruiting new members.
Now, in an event landscape divided by in-person and remote experiences, MBOs are placing greater emphasis on two major trends, one of which is building a better website.
Why are MBOs strengthening their marketing with a better digital presence?
A primary reason is to attract new members. This audience, typically younger and digitally savvy, quickly searches for what value they can expect from your website and other online experiences. Oftentimes, their decision to join depends on your ability to effectively provide a great online experience.
The website ideas and strategies below are based on BizStream’s experience working with associations and MBO’s websites and marketing programs. These will not only help you with membership recruitment, but also can improve ties with existing members, resulting in better retention year over year.
A top reason why people join associations is for connection. People are naturally wired to participate in communities of people with shared interests.
Your website is the place to foster and strengthen connections. It’s where your members go to find engagement opportunities. While in person connections are great, the truth is your website is open 24/7, making it an extremely convenient and accessible destination. For new members, your website is often the first exposure to your organization and the launching pad toward establishing themselves in your community.
Unfortunately, many MBO websites miss the mark. Information is obscured, lost in complex navigation and user-averse, instead of user-friendly experiences.
How can you correct this online connection conundrum?
From an information accessibility standpoint, consider:
If you feel confident that your site’s taxonomy and navigation are clear, then there are two other ways to strengthen your community:
When we interview members as part of our website discovery and audit process, we always hear that finding information is a struggle. That, and knowing who to contact for questions.
Awareness is another major struggle for MBOs. But what if we told you there’s a free membership recruitment hack right in front of you?
We’re talking about sharing your existing members’ stories to advertise the value your organization offers. If prospects hear true stories from real members, that may be the nudge they need to sign up.
Today, many people are skeptical of claims coming from companies. They want authentic accounts from real customers. That helps explain why social influencers and brand ambassadors are popular.
The importance of developing a clear and seamless onboarding experience can’t be overstated. What does this mean for your website, though?
It means investing in great user experience (UX) design and intuitive navigation.
Consider creating a welcome video to ensure members know where to find information. If you want to take this a step further, use a tool such as Pendo, which takes users on a guided tour of your website or app.
Have you ever asked yourself: What’s something you can provide that no organization can?
We’ve found this question is integral to unlocking your website’s unique value proposition and keeping members engaged.
For example, many associations offer professional development certifications. Some of them, especially in technical industries, require members to log a minimum number of hours toward obtaining certifications.
This fundamental insight led to a brilliant idea: What if you made it easy for people to log those hours under their profile on your website? What if others could see their progress? Or maybe they could add professional accolades to their profile or display which association committees they participate in? The possibilities are endless.
The goal with stickiness, also known as “recurring engagement,” is finding ways to seamlessly deliver value to entice your audience to become return website visitors. If you can master stickiness, you’ll prove to new, prospective members that your organization is offering value they can’t afford to miss.
If you’re looking for a marketing technology partner who has proven experience working with association and member-based organizations, contact our team.

The Mental Health Day: You Owe It to Yourself
Wednesday, March 3rd, 2021. The proverbial “breaking point” for me. Let’s talk about the metaphorical mental cocktail that I’d been perfecting for some time. Take one shot of 14-month isolation, mix vigorously with equal parts government mandates, and fancy bar graphs depicting deaths per million. Add one teaspoon of a vitriol presidential election for flavor and garnish with a lawsuit from an unhappy customer who just wants to have a wedding during a global pandemic (I own a wedding venue as a side gig).
Once I had perfected its potency, I took a big swig on March 3rd and then stared at my computer screen for 15 minutes before realizing that I simply could not work that day. The laptop was closed. Not a word was spoken to my colleagues. I simply got out of my chair with no real plan.  As a PM, not having a plan is kind of a big deal. Engage cerebral autopilot.
Get Keys.Get coat.Walk to car.Place keys in car.Drive.Continue driving.Don’t stop driving.
During the pandemic, my wife pointed out that “It’s Fine” had become a bit of a daily overindulgence for my vocabulary, brutally forced into my subconscious after months of throwing my hands up in the air at every mention of the word COVID or lockdown. It was my feeble attempt at trying to brush it all off.
I started using this phrase mostly as a joke. “It’s Fine.”
Another six months of lockdowns? It’s fine. My favorite restaurant closed again? It’s fine.We are facing our 4th lawsuit in three months. It’s…fine?
You get the idea. I had hit a point where I simply needed to disengage and shut down for a bit. To quote the IT Crowd, I tried turning it off and then back on again. It had taken months for me to finally come to the realization that things weren’t okay, and honestly, that’s okay. We all know that times are rather strange right now. Like a three-year-old throwing a tantrum, I refused to submit to the notion that this was the “new normal.” As a coping mechanism, I hid behind words like “it’s okay” or the all-too-classic meme.
This is fine. Everything is fine.
The truth is, I was not okay. I needed a day to reflect. To shut down and perform a hard system reboot. Clear the cache and start fresh. Once I had committed to taking a much-needed mental break, it was remarkable how simple and effective it was at getting me back into the right state of mind.

Kentico Xperience Page Builder: Complex Sections & Widgets
Page Builder by Kentico Xperience is a very powerful tool for developers and content administrators. Giving this much power to content admins can be a little worrisome when you’re used to more structured content, but giving your content admins the freedom to customize their pages without calling you for redesigns will keep them happy. I’m going to highlight some of our custom generic column sections and our carousel and configurator widgets below.
Instead of having multiple sections cluttering the section selection menu to handle all the client requirements, we made a generic column section. The section properties has a simple dropdown for the content admin to select the desired number of columns.
In the section’s view, we set the Bootstrap class to the colCount divided by twelve to obtain even Widget Zones. In the case of the admin selecting five columns, Bootstrap rounds down the “2.4” to 2.
The result is dynamic and provides a lot of customization to the content admin without flooding them with too many section options.
We wanted to provide the client with a highly diversifiable carousel widget so each carousel fits their needs. We’re using SwiperJs for its vast amount of customization and ease of use. If you look at those Swiper demos, it would’ve been easy for us to go overboard with the widget properties.
Instead, we contained it to what the client specifically wanted and some nice to haves. Using the PathSelector widget property type allowed us to mix structured content and the flexibility of page builder. Before creating the carousel widget, the content admin would need to create the slides by populating a folder with our Slide page type. Then add in the carousel widget and edit the properties to select the folder they just created.
In the CarouselWidgetController class (below), we’re using the selected path to get all the children in that carousel folder and its children (slides).
Building clean reusable widgets and sections will speed up your development for future projects and give your content administrators the confidence to create the pages they need.

Learning Cypress Automation With Cypress Studio
Just like in the world of development, efficiency and speed are integral parts of the QA process at BizStream! In the never-ending process of improving our speed and efficiency, we reached a point where we knew automation could help enhance our testing. More specifically, we wanted to improve and automate our manually repetitive and regression types of testing. A variety of languages and testing tools were explored to help us do just that. After some searching, a colleague of mine, Tyler Pfohl, came across Cypress.
As a non-developer, it has been quite an adventure (and a steep learning curve), but it has also been a lot of fun learning a coding language. Haha…what I am really trying to say is that it does not look like I am going to be a developer anytime soon. How do you bridge that learning gap without slowing down your QA process? Let’s welcome to Cypress Studio!
Back in January, Cypress released a new feature called Cypress Studio. With the help of a starter script, as shown below, you can start a screen recorder that will record your keystrokes and user movements around a site. Cypress Studio takes those recordings, converts them into Cypress commands, and places them right into your script. This has really helped me learn a variety of those commands that are useful for other scripts I am working on. Slowly but surely, I can start editing scripts on my own using the commands I have learned. The recorder also allows for a quicker turnaround time when getting an automated test up and running.
There is a little bit of learning involved with getting Cypress itself started up, but Cypress Docs has some great documentation to help get you up and running. With Cypress and Cypress Studio running, you can run your startup script. Within the Cypress Test Runner, there is now a little magic button that allows you to start recording, as seen here. Follow the prompts and start recording your script.
Let’s say you have been hearing about how awesome this team at BizStream is, so let’s check them out! Using that magical “Add Commands to Test” button in Cypress Studio, here is a small script that would take you to the BizStream team page so you can check out the team. The generated code is even inserted with comments so that you know where the generated script has been added.
With some basic Cypress familiarity and the use of Cypress Studio, I was able to generate a reproducible automated script within minutes. With a script now in hand, you can easily go back to review and make sure items like your URLs and element selectors were recorded correctly. Additional assertions or commands can also now be added to your script and then simply just re-run it from there. Overall, Cypress Studio has proven to be a very useful tool in growing my Cypress skills over the past few months. Happy scripting, everyone!

4 Ways to Take Control of Your Metadata and Increase Your Social Media Presence
Early in 2020, I made the decision to go Plant-Based (Vegan). I’ve scoured the web for various recipes, meat substitutes for my favorite dishes, and a replacement for what I miss the most—Ice Cream. A friend of mine suggested a hometown creamery’s dairy-free “ice cream,” and it didn’t disappoint.
Eager to share my newfound love for this amazing plant-based creamy deliciousness, I looked up the flavor online, copied the URL, and pasted it into Facebook to start my post on how amazing it was…
What the heck was this? Facebook was grabbing the logo! I expected some great imagery of the product in all its non-dairy goodness. How could this be? This must be a mistake. After all, the page for the product has amazing imagery.
How could they not include a social image to showcase their product? I’m trying to give them free promotion to all my vegan friends after all! A brand with an amazing product has lost a chance at free promotion from one of their raving fans just because they didn’t include a simple tag and image in their webpage code for their product.
I found it interesting that they do use Open Graph images, but only on their blog articles.
There’s that beautiful imagery I was looking for! Hudsonville Ice Cream even made a custom social image for their blog post to be sure it made an impact when shared. Why not put that same effort into their products?
I don’t want to pick on Hudsonville Ice Cream; after all, they have a fantastic plant-based product I love. They’re not alone in missing out on social images for their products. After my experience with Hudsonville Ice Cream, I started paying attention to other brands and found many don’t include a social image on their product pages.
Sharing the So Delicious product looks a little better than Hudsonville, but still, their product’s image is cropped and really doesn’t do their product justice. Again, So Delicious doesn’t include specific images in their code for social sharing. They are relying on the social media platform to display an image from their product page, and in this case, their square product image has been cropped at the top and bottom.
Relying on the social platform to select and display your product or content can be problematic, as shown in this example from a press release that was shared on LinkedIn.
I’m sure the headshot looked amazing, but because it is in portrait orientation on the page, LinkedIn grabbed it and cropped it to the center, cutting off the woman’s eyes.
Adding social images may seem like a lot of added work, but in reality, it’s a way for you to control how your brand appears off-site. After all, you won’t put out a print piece without having full control over how it appears, right? The same goes for social media. You have control over how your brand appears when users share your content. Make the most of it.
Open Graph tags are the easiest way to control how your content looks when shared on social platforms. Originally designed for Facebook, many social platforms, including LinkedIn, also use that tagging system to allow you to control both the copy and images displayed when someone shares your content.
There are a ton of articles on what size image you should use for Open Graph and how to set up Open Graph for your specific CMS/DXP. We’re not going to get into those details. Instead, we’re going to give you 4 steps on how we approach adding social sharing tags to our client’s sites:
At BizStream, this is something we practice and encourage our clients to do as well. Every page on our website includes custom images and description tags for both Facebook (Open Graph) and Twitter.
By creating these custom tags for each page and adding custom imagery, it allows us to take control of our brand, make our content fun, and provides content that stands out when viewed on social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. Taking the added step of doing this for all our pages help us stand out from the competition—if your competition isn’t doing this, it can act as a differentiator for you and help you stand out from the crowd.

Design Like a Developer
“Anything is possible with code.” This is a very common phrase thrown around when talking to clients or development teams about implementing features on a project. As I have transitioned from development into the design world, that phrase has quickly become “Anything is possible with code, but only with a good design.” As a web designer, it is important to bridge the gap between development and design through your work. Doing so allows for successful implementation, the ability to achieve realistic timelines, and ultimately, the delivery of a full-fledged, pixel-perfect web complaint site to your client. In order to achieve these project milestones, you must design with your developer in mind. Throughout my design process, I quickly found out that there are plenty of do’s and don’ts when it comes to creating something that can turn into clean and working code.
I will be going over five basic design rules to follow to ensure that your work is always created with the developer in mind.
1. Use The Grid. Consistent layouts are key to making sure your designs are perfectly implemented in code. The first steps in designing always start with determining your canvas, layout, and grid settings. Using the grid is crucial to allow for fluid and responsive design and is a big determining factor in how consistent your design project will be. What exactly is the grid? Is a twelve-column layout that has become standard in design due to its flexibility in dividing columns for responsive design. Most design tools have a grid layout system already baked in and are very easy to set up. When I use Sketch, I can set my grid for a workspace fairly easily.
An example of a common grid setup is shown here:
Once you define your grid for a project, be sure to note these specifications in a style guide that is provided to the development team. That way, they can easily translate any gutters, widths, or layouts in their code with any front-end framework that is built off of this same concept.

Accessibility awareness is on the rise, and if you are in any way involved in tech, there is no doubt that you have been part of a discussion involving web accessibility and ADA compliance recently. From seminars to certifications, it is becoming super important to make sure that designers and developers aren’t only gaining knowledge of, but also creating their work based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). So why is this so important? As an engineer, you need to make sure that your product is accessible and has a consistent user experience for all of its users. The WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) states, “Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.” TLDR; you want to make sure that the product you are creating doesn’t get you sued.
These guidelines are a set of rules constructed to guide you to keep your site compliant, but this all starts with the design. A common issue I find when I am looking at certain designs or websites is regarding their color palette being used. One accessibility rule states your site must  ‘ensure that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text’. This seems simple enough but is often a common issue missed by many by the time it gets into the hands of the developer. Luckily, there are countless tools, both native and for download, to help guide you to make sure your site is compliant. One tool I commonly use to create my color palette for any project is WebAIM’s color contrast checker. This is a simple tool to help make sure that you are creating web-compliant color pallets for your design style guides that are code-ready.
Another great tool is the Cluse plugin for Sketch. This free-of-charge tool helps you test the contrast of various color layers within your project.
As a designer, it is hard to fight the urge to create the most extravagant deliverable with all the bells and whistles for the client. You want to deliver the next best thing; we all do. However, the design process is very similar to code. By following concepts of ‘not reinventing the wheel’ or the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid), as a designer, you will natively start thinking in terms of code early on in the process. Know your audience you are designing for, and don’t overcomplicate things.
Setting a good foundation for a website through your design is crucial to allow for additional development to be implemented in the future. Your MVP design should consist of pages constructed by reusable components globally used throughout the project. Constantly ask yourself, ‘Where can this design element or feature be reused?’ Noting these consistencies in the documentation and style guide for the development team will be huge for consistency and estimating the project.
Coming from a development background, it is almost second nature for me to think, ‘How can this be implemented in code?’ when creating something. This isn’t always the case for some designers. Luckily, there are tools out there to help you grasp development concepts and implement them into your designs. Webflow is a tool for designers to create fully functioning websites without touching any code. It is also a great way to design with front-end concepts in mind.
The dashboard is very CSS-focused and allows you to create your designs in a very code-oriented way.
Webflow’s design dashboard even gives you the ability to apply already existing styles through its ‘selector’ system which directly translates to CSS classes in HTML. Webflow is a great tool for any designer who is new to writing CSS and wants some knowledge of various CSS properties. W3Schools also has a great CSS Course if you want to learn some of Cascading Stylesheets’ basics.
By now, you should be well acquainted with concepts of the grid, style guides, reusability in your designs, and so on. How can you make sure that all of these concepts are being implemented correctly in your design project? Trial and error, for one, but another important concept when it comes to working with a development team is collaboration. Whether it is through your deliverables or down to features to be implemented, any input from an outside-of-the-design team member will always be beneficial for your work.
At my previous employer, I was a front-end developer working with the design team, on the same floor, same row, sometimes even the same desk as me. There was a constant flow of communication when it came to their designs. ‘How long would this variation take to develop over this one?’ ‘Is this even doable?’ ‘How would you approach this in your code?’ were common questions early on in any project’s design process coming from the designer. We were not siloed, and we were more often working together than not. This is why I feel like having an in-house design team is crucial to any development shop’s success. Not just because it helps with keeping things internalized from a billing and estimating perspective, but because at the end of the day, teams are meant to work together in the same space to reach the same goal: create an awesome product for the client.
Tech is forever changing. Design is also forever changing. With new tools popping up every day to countless design systems to work with, it can be a bit overwhelming. Knowing how to work with your development team is key. Keeping collaboration, consistency, and web-accessible deliverables in mind, you will be successful in creating web-focused designs. If you are new to design like me, a graphic designer turned web, or even a complete career change into the design world, know that you will be on track to start designing like a developer in no time with these five steps.

8 Tips for Maintaining Sanity During Difficult Times
Many of us have felt the result not just at work but also at home. For some of us, it might not have hit us too hard; for others, it has been devastating. But, regardless of the magnitude, we have all been affected in one way or another. So here are a few ideas that may benefit you or even help you think of new ways to continue to tough it out through 2021.
Personally, I am very grateful that myself and my family have “survived” thus far with our health and jobs intact. Yet, there have been many disappointments and adjustments on the way, and they keep on coming. Working from home and virtual school for my three children has often been quite a challenge. Being mostly “holed up” at home and not being able to see friends and family or even to go out often leads to feelings of loneliness. The most difficult thing for me, as a mom, is to have to sit my children down and tell them that one more thing they have been looking forward to has been canceled: another sports season, 4-h shows, church groups/activities, vacations, camps, and my daughter’s a once-in-a-lifetime East Coast Trip with her classmates.
With no real end in sight to the pandemic, it’s easy to feel down, both physically and emotionally. So I ask myself, “What are some ways we have used or are using, both at work and at home, to help cope with some of the stress and issues that Covid has brought about?”.
Here are a few ideas that may be beneficial to you or even help you think of new ways yourself to continue to tough it out through 2021.
1. Give yourself grace. Don’t be too hard on yourself (or your children). 2020 was a rough year, but you survived it.  2021, you got it, no problem!
2. Try to focus on the positives. Have you been able to spend more time with the family, less time commuting, lessen your commitments outside of work, focus more on your hobbies, or more time for self-care?
3. Maintain your physical health. Exercise has always been a great way for me to blow off steam, and I feel a lot better afterward. Even if you can’t go to a gym, there are many programs online you can do at home without any or little equipment. Challenge yourself. Get creative and get your family/friends involved.
4. Get outside when you can and enjoy nature. Science shows that going outside has many benefits, including giving you more energy and mental focus.
5. Connect virtually with people. Virtual hangouts can be a way to feel connected to your friends, family, and even co-workers. At BizStream, we have been doing virtual happy hours just to chill and catch up with our fellow team members. This past summer, we even held a socially distanced parking lot party just to be able to get together in person.
6. Find creative ways to help or do something kind for someone else who is struggling. Send a card, bring a meal or care package, or call or text to let someone know you are thinking of them. Bringing joy to others often brings more joy to ourselves.
7. Find substitutions. “We can’t do/go ______, but we can do/go ______”.
8. Focus on things you CAN do. Play games, go to parks, go for walks, catch up on your favorite show or read that book you never seem to have time to finish.
Hang in there, and best wishes to you in 2021.

From the dropdown menu, select the “Is in persona” option to select from one of your personas that we setup.
You can be sure you’ve done this correctly by checking to see that the single person has changed into a group
You can be sure you’ve done this correctly by checking to see that the single person has changed into a group
Selecting the group of people will show you all the variants you have created and allow you to change between them so you can modify your content.
You can target specific parts of the page and only create variants for sections that you think will matter for that specific persona.
The customization doesn’t end with pages built with page builder. Let’s assume someone filled out a form after buying our product. It makes sense to send an email tailored with their persona. This is where the marketing automation processes of Kentico can really shine. We can start with setting up a trigger within the marketing automation of a form fill:
Once we have the starting trigger setup, we can split out the path forward by using an if/else condition. The macro editor will allow us to easily select which persona or personas we want to split off, as well as sending a default email to anyone who doesn’t have a persona yet.
Now with a few simple conditions, our personas have been set up in the designer.
We can now take the next step and create emails for each persona. Using the Send Marketing Email action, you can specify which email or what drip feed you wish to send. If you don’t have the emails already created, you can create them directly from the Marketing Automation!
After we have all the steps defined, we can simply drag the pieces together in a nice flow, and we’re ready to go!

What it Means to Care as a Developer and Why You Should Want to
Identifying your company’s core values helps in many ways. It helps you identify the right people to hire and justify firing the people who aren’t a good fit. It helps you choose which projects to take on and which to let go of. And it gives your team a clear model to aspire to. BizStream lives by seven Core Values, one of them being “Care”. The following is my interpretation of one of the ways it means to care at BizStream.
There are many ways to care at BizStream. Here is the “official” list:
This blog post will focus on, “Care about your work, the project being successful, the client being happy, and the team working well together.” During my time working at BizStream as a web developer and leader, it has become easy to tell when a person has put careful thought into what they are delivering versus just getting a task off their plate as quickly as possible—often making more work for others. Here are some things to consider before handing off your work.
Too often, developers get caught up in deadlines and schedules, and the temptation to check in code that “probably” works is great. The problem is that making those assumptions, more often than not, leads to more work later because you have to get back in the headspace of the project and spin it all back up. It’s better to be 100% sure it’s ready now.
Within reason, of course. We’re all human, and we all make mistakes.
Anything that could be found, should have been tested for by you. You know what your code does, you know what it interacts with, you spent time at the beginning identifying potential weaknesses and a test plan. There’s no reason QA should find big obvious problems.
Anything big that could be found, should be found in PR. When you’re putting your pull request together, feel free to point out any areas of your code that seem weak or you don’t feel great about. This is the last opportunity to have someone else weigh in and help out.
QA should be looking for edge cases and that your changes flow well with the rest of the app. They should not be your last line of defense against 404 pages and buttons that aren’t wired up. In the course of development, you should have been clicking everywhere and doing tests on the fly. You know that when you parsed that string, you need to check inputs that are too long or too short. You know that when you filter on a date range, you need to test dates and times right at the limits of the range to be sure you got your “<” and “>=” right. And if you don’t know that, it will come with experience.
Take deliberate time to review your work. A self-review of your work is a given. It’s a part of development. Senior devs, how many times in all your years have you been in a hurry fixing a “simple” bug, checked it in without testing, only to have it blow up for QA, and they send it right back to you because you spelled something wrong? Something that would have been obvious if you took the 5 seconds to pull up the UI and hit F5. Just one example, but there are so many places to take deliberate time to ensure success down the line.
Don’t do this:
Do this:
There are hundreds of ways to show you care in any job on any project, and the effects of the caring you put out there can be felt throughout your team. Imagine being the QA person for someone who obviously never tests their own work and uses QA as a catch-all for their bugs. Resentment would, understandably, creep into that relationship quite quickly. These are just a few examples of how a developer can show they care on a daily basis, and how we at BizStream try to live up to our Core Values every day.

A Quick and Dirty Guide to Placing Trades on Forex.com via Python
For anyone who has previously attempted to use Python to integrate with Forex.com’s API for algorithmic training and failed, I feel for you. Due to “alright” API documentation on Forex.com’s end, and a lack of documentation on the Lightstreamer side of things, it was no easy feat to get something working. With that being said, after going on a short hiatus of not working on this and then revisiting it with fresh eyes, I can finally utilize Forex.com’s API and place trades via Python.
Forex.com is a foreign exchange broker. In layman’s terms, they’re a service that allows you to exchange currency for other currencies (like converting US dollars to Euros) on the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange market is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily volume of over 6 trillion dollars. For reference, the U.S. stock market sees about 90 billion dollars of daily volume. Due to this high level, there’s a lot of liquidity in the forex market, making it a great candidate for algorithmic trading.
Before anything else, an account with Forex.com is needed, and thankfully they offer demo accounts, so you don’t have to risk your actual money when you’re getting your code setup and working.
As far as I know, the only way to gain API access for the created account is by contacting their support team and requesting API access. This process may have been improved since my experience, but I’m sure this approach will still work even if there’s an automated process now.
This is also the only way I’m aware of to gain access to the API documentation, as I haven’t been able to search for it using a search engine. Due to this, I will not be able to show screenshots or snippets from the documentation itself, but I will show my implementation.
A session ID is needed for every request made to the API, so we need to get one before doing anything else. To do this, we’ll need to make a POST request to the TradingAPI’s session endpoint. The body of the POST will need to include our username, password, and app key. The username and password are the exact same as you would use to access the Forex.com WebTrader, and the app key is a value that gets provided to you when you set up API access to your live or demo account. Here’s an example get_session() method
Now that we have our session ID, we can now retrieve our Trading Account ID from the API. To do so, we need to make a request to the /useraccount/ClientAndTradingAccount endpoint. This call and all other requests require us to include authentication headers, which consist of your username and the session ID from the step above. Here’s an example get_trading_account_id() method
Now we need to get some market IDs for the different markets we might want to trade in. For this example, I’ll only be looking to place trades in the EUR/USD market. This is probably one of the simplest requests we’ll make. The endpoint we need to hit is the /market/fullsearchwithtags endpoint, which takes in a query parameter that lets us pass in the market names we want information about. Here’s an example get_market_info() method
Here’s where the meat and potatoes of this process come in. All previous and future steps involve us making requests to a HTTP service, but we need to interface with a streaming API to get current price data. In this case, Forex.com is using a library called Lightstreamer (https://lightstreamer.com) to stream data to clients. Unfortunately, there is no python client library straight from Lightstreamer. Fortunately, someone has made their own version for us to use. To use it, just run:
Now that we have our Lightstreamer Client library, we need to build the connection and subscribe to the correct data stream. First things first, we need to create a LightstreamerClient object. This takes in our username, session ID, API Url, and something named an adapter_set. In this instance, the adapter_set is STREAMINGALL.
Next up is creating our LightstreamerSubscription object. This is what determines what information we get back in the stream response. This object takes 4 parameters: mode, adapter, items, and fields. Below is a quick description of each.
Here’s an example of all these fields broken out using methods we previously created.
Now that we have a subscription object, we need to provide a method to add as an event listener. In this case, we’ll make a method called on_item_update(update_item) which takes in an object that has all the fields we requested as part of the subscription object setup. Below is a sample event listener method that simply prints out the fields we wanted. For your own usage, you would want to save these in some way to be used later on. We’ll also include the call that adds the method as an event listener.
All that’s left now is connecting to the server side of Lightstreamer, and connecting the subscription to that connection. After making these two calls, we’ll start getting updates every time the streaming API pushes our new values. Here’s how to do that
As you can see, when subscribing, we get a key value. This can be used at a later time to kill the connection like so
We finally have all the information we need to place a trade. To do so, we need to construct a JSON object that contains information about the trade we want to place. For this object, we’ll need data from a few different things. First, we need the Audit ID and either the Bid or Offer price from the streaming API (the price used is based on if this is a buy or sell operation). We will also need the market ID of what market we want to trade in, as well as your Trading Account ID from earlier. In this example, I’m requesting a static quantity of 10,000, but this could also be easily made into a variable that can be modified for each request. The same goes for the PriceTolerance value, which determines how much slippage in price you’re willing to allow. Here’s the full example place_trade() method
Calling this method should successfully place a trade using your account.
If you’ve followed this full post, you should have everything you need to start placing trades in the market. Obviously, there’s plenty of space to improve, like putting this all in a class or a couple of different classes so you can have variables always at your disposal for things like your session ID, streaming data values, and anything else you might need. The goal of this post was to give some simple copy-paste lines of code that can be used together to get you up and running as fast as possible.

Defining Personas to Enhance Your Kentico Xperience Site
Do you know what an individual or group of users is doing on your Kentico Xperience website? Google Analytics can provide a high-level overview of what is being viewed but isn’t great at tracking at a macro level. As a trusted website and application consultant, BizStream leads many conversations about delivering tailored user experiences to various website visitors. In this post, I’ll break out some of our common advice and share how Kentico Xperience can logically do segmentation of groups based on the rules you define.
When we start on the user journey with our clients, we commonly discuss two items for each page of their site: What is the goal of a page, and what types of people visit the said page? This often creates a matrix, as different people visit pages for different reasons. For today’s example, I’ve generalized a page from one of our e-commerce clients working in manufacturing. They have three types of people that typically interact with their category landing pages:
The above process of designating groups of people within a website is often called building Personas. As a best practice, we usually suggest people identify between two and five personas at the start of their project. You’ll want these personas to be as unique from each other as they can be. You can get into the further refinement of personas once you have a baseline. For instance, maybe there is a persona for super-engaged designers that is based on the number of times they attend events associated with the brand. This is a good segmentation point but is usually overkill for the start of the project.
The more you know about someone, the more likely you can tailor their experience into something that will resonate with them in a meaningful way. This personalization leads to a happier user experience, which, in our experience, results in hitting our key website performance goals. Now that we have some idea of the personas we want, we can create them in Kentico and set up the automation of users into personas.
One quick note, personas, and other digital marketing tools, are provided as part of the Xperience Enterprise licensing. If you have just the business license, you can upgrade (We can assist with this process; just contact us) to access all the marketing features.
Once you have logged in to the Kentico Administrator site (Also known as the Kentico Mother), you can access the personas application by selecting the icon in the top left corner or by pressing ‘F2’ and then typing in personas. From there, you can select the add a new persona button.
Here we can enter the Persona name, add an image if want, and, most importantly, talk a little about why they will be placed into this persona. This helps us as we begin making rules about adding points for different activities on the site.
Once that information is set up, we’ll begin associating site activity or information we know about the user to add to the persona point score. This scoring system allows you to further refine how a user ends up in a specific group.
Personas logic would say that a user is in at most one persona at a time, so we really want to key in on what specific activities indicate they are in specific groups. Kentico tracks in three primary categories:
While each of the above options has its use cases, we often find site activity tracking to be of extreme importance to building a good persona. As such, we often encourage a minimum of three activity-based rules for each persona.
You can see all these various options by selecting the rules menu item and selecting the green New rule button.
In the persona design phase, we often encourage our clients to just start adding rules and then figure out the thresholds of points for each attribute or activity after they do some live testing. For Marty’s example, our client added a rule for if visited the gallery pages, product detail pages, and a large number of points if they filled out a form requesting a design consultation.
Now that we have some rules set up, Kentico will do its best to track both logged-in and anonymous users and will even merge some information together if a user starts anonymous and then changes to a logged-in user, placing them into proper personas. Better than generic page view data, having an idea of how many people are fitting into each persona is vital in planning out marketing automation.

IIS Performance Tips and Scripts
Lately, I’ve been trying to improve the performance of our web server, which runs IIS 10.0 on a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine. We host over 150 application pools that run many of our internal sites and tools, as well as some of our multi-tenant applications. In this article, I’ll give a few tips on how I was able to reduce the server’s memory footprint by 50% and improve the responsiveness of our sites.
IIS configuration can be a bit confusing. There is a hierarchy of configuration files that handle various settings, and it can be tough to memorize which settings are located in each one. To break it down:
Luckily Microsoft has a handy PowerShell module available for IIS 8 and above to help manage all these settings. I will demonstrate using the IISAdministration module. You can verify it is installed with this snippet:
By default, your IIS site is not actually loaded and running until the first request is served. This means that your site can be slow to load initially. There are a few different strategies you can employ to mitigate this, but I chose to have our sites ready and running at all times. To do this, I will be setting some properties in the applicationHost.config file using PowerShell.
I first need to make sure I have the IISAdministration module loaded and get a reference to the IIS Server Manager:
Next, I iterate through all of the sites and set the properties I want:
Now our applicationHost.config file will be updated with the above values, and our sites and application pools will automatically startup with the server. Our sites will be speedy and have no delay when the first request comes in, but now it seems we have another problem. With all of these sites always running, it looks like the server’s memory is filling up fast! What do we do?
By default, IIS will configure application pools as 64-bit when the operating system supports it, and this can be a problem for site performance and server memory usage.It turns out that Microsoft recommends setting your application pools to 32-bit unless you have a specific 64-bit dependency, and it has been the recommendation since 2007! It seems this advice continues into .NET Core as well. From the article:
One of the performance benefits of the x64 platform is that it increases virtual address space, making more memory available. We recommend that you configure IIS to use a 32-bit worker processes on 64-bit Windows. Not only is compatibility better than the native 64-bit, performance and memory consumption are also better.
To do this, we have to set the enable32BitAppOnWin64=”true” attribute on our application pools. We can do this in the same PowerShell snippet above by adding this line below the other application pool configuration changes:
However, since we probably want this setting to apply to all of our application pools and all the ones we make in the future, we should set this on the <applicationPoolDefaults> node in applicationHost.config. To do this with PowerShell, we can add this to our snippet before we call CommitChanges():
After the changes are committed, our node will be updated like this:
Note that we could also set the StartMode and AutoStart properties on the ApplicationPoolDefaults as well.
In our situation, our server was consistently utilizing around 80% memory, according to Task Manager. After setting the application pool defaults to enable 32-bit, that utilization IMMEDIATELY dropped to 40%. Quite a difference!
I hope this article was able to help you improve your site performance with IIS, or share some ideas for utilizing PowerShell for site configuration. The IISAdministration module is very powerful and can be used to manage all of your site settings well beyond what I’ve covered here. Please see the documentation for additional details.

How to Set up a Raspberry Pi VI: Set up Release Pipeline to Raspberry Pi
If you’ve made it this far in your journey of your web site and azure pipelines, you are in the home stretch. Once this is done, it’s just a one-click deploy from your repository to your production site. This can be somewhat involved, and probably takes an hour to do.
But don’t worry, I’ll try to make it easy.
1. To start creating your release pipeline, go back to dev.azure.com/teamname, click on your projects, then go to Pipelines -> Releases.
2. Under New, click on New release pipeline
This will give you a blank template of what you want your release to look like. You should be seeing something like this.
It’s going to open up a menu on the right-hand side of the screen that looks like this
3. Just click on Empty job
4. If you’ve already created a build pipeline, you can add the output of that build as an artifact. Just click on the plus button next to Add an artifact.
5. Fill in the information that relates to the Pipeline that you set up earlier, and click Add.
6. Click on the Stage and name it by what you are deploying to (a Raspberry Pi) .
1. Under Pipelines, click on Deployment groups.
2. Then click on New under Deployment groups.
3. Name the group something you’ll remember
4. Hit Create
5. In the Type of target to register, Select Linux
6. Make sure you select the box Use personal access token in the script for authentication.
7. Click on Copy script to the clipboard
You will need to change this script. The default script includes a full-blown x64 Linux script, you don’t want that; you need the script that does arm.
8. In the script you copied, replace the part of the script where you find this with this.
Note that the only difference here is the fact that I replaced x64 with arm, so if you are on a newer version, just test the link in the browser to see if it works for the download.
Take this script, and copy it into a terminal window in the Raspberry Pi, and run it in your home directory (you can get there by typing in cd ~)
Also, it’s going to ask you to Enter deployment group tags for agent; press y for yes. Put in a description of the raspberry pi (for me, I put in something like Pi4 Deploy)
If you have to re-run this, then go into your home directory and type rm -r azagent first to get rid of any installs.
9. Once this is done, you can go look at your deployment group in Azure and see if it’s online or not.
There’s no need to create a service; the script you ran did that all for you! All that’s left is to finish configuring your release pipeline and run it.
1. Go to Pipelines -> Releases, click on the Release you made earlier, and click Edit
2. Go to Tasks and click on the default task that was created with your pipeline.
3. Create a deployment group job. This creates a context that all of the releases run.
4. In the Deployment group, select the group as the one that you created in the previous steps. Your build artifact is automatically selected for you.
5. We don’t need the agent job, so click on Agent Job and then click Remove. After that, click on Save to save your current progress on the release pipeline.
The Release Pipeline is now going to run in the context of all of the agents inside of the deployment group. Now we can start telling it to do things.
1. Copy your files from the Artifact to a working directory.
Take note of the Source folder, this has your project folder that it saves your zip file to; you will need that later.
2. Stop the kestrel service
3. Stop nginx from serving your site
All the other steps involve creating bash scripts as you did in the last step, so just keep creating them with the following settings
4. Delete your current website
5. Unzip your artifact to your website directory
6. Start NginX again
7. Start the kestrel service that hosts dotnet
8. After this, your release pipeline should look like this
9. Save your Pipeline
10. Go ahead at test it out by clicking Create release
11. You can manually create your release from the Pipeline. Later you can set it up to trigger on certain conditions (like if you push to the Master branch of your repo). Click on Create
12. After the Release is created, you need to trigger it. If you go to Pipelines-> Releases and click on your pipeline, you should see your first release, go ahead and click on it.
13. This will bring you back into the pipeline and show you where this Release needs to be triggered. Click on the Deploy button after hovering over the stage to trigger the release.
14. While you triggered the deployment, you should see the task turn to In Progress. To view more information, just click the link
15. It tells you what the status of the task is. To view the steps/scripts that it’s currently running, click the graph.
16. In order to get the details, you may have to refresh this page
This is really handy for troubleshooting any errors that may have happened during your build. It tells you what the status is on each step of the process.
That’s it!
It’s a long process to get here, but once you are here, it’s easy to automate builds. You can set up your releases to trigger on a push to the master branch and set up new environments on other pis (Like if you are hosting a local web app). Now all of your deployments are done by a push of a button instead of manually compiling a list of changes to push when you update your code.

How to Set up a Raspberry Pi IV: Creating a .NET Core Website on Your Pi
Most websites that run on-premise production servers require a lot of hardware. If all you need is a dev site or something local that you want to tinker with, then a Raspberry Pi works just fine. In my case, I know this is only a local website. Also, there is only me and maybe one other person that will be able to access it. It’s also really good for creating an app with familiar web programming languages. Whatever your case, this is what I had to do to set up my very own website on the Raspberry Pi.
Keep in mind I don’t go through any DNS settings to make this available to the outside world since I only wanted mine available locally. There are no security concerns that I addressed here either, so you may have to customize what I did to enable that.
3. This will direct you to the navigation page. Next, change the directory to Downloads by opening the terminal window and typing cd Downloads.
4. To get the install script, scroll down on the browser you downloaded .NET from, and copy/paste the script into a terminal window.
5. Press Enter to run the last command.
6. It doesn’t automatically make dotnet a global command, so you have to add that to Linux’s version of your PATH. To do this, open up .bashrc by typing, less ~/.bashrc.
7. Type, v.
8. Scroll down to the end of the file.
9. Type, export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/dotnet.
10. cntrl+X to exit.
11. Y to save.
12. Enter to confirm.
13. Q to quit less.
14. Close and reopen your terminal
15. Type in, dotnet –version
16. If it displays the latest version of dotnet, then you were successful! Now on to actually making your website!
Making your own website locally is one of the coolest ways to test your deployments and to tinker with your own development skills. Other people might think that you know a lot of stuff if you can show this off. So with that, I say, show off your brand new site with pride.

How to Set Up a Raspberry Pi V: Set Up Build to Raspberry Pi Using Azure DevOps
If you want to run a website from your Raspberry Pi, there is good news for you. It can be done! If you read my other blog post, Creating a .Net Core Website on Your Pi. If you want to automate your builds and deploy them to a Raspberry Pi, you’ve come to the right place. This makes it so that you can do all of your development on a windows environment (or any environment, or from multiple environments) and deploy seamlessly with a click of a button to a Raspberry Pi. Bad news, it’s not very easy to figure out how to set it up initially. As far as I know, there isn’t a good tutorial on how to do this. So, here it goes.
1. Get a website working. I’m using a .NET Core app with REACT.
2. Get an account on Azure DevOps –  I will admit, this is the only thing that I never actually did myself. I used an existing account to do this.
3. Have a repository where you store your .NET Core solution.
1. Go to dev.azure.com/azureaccount
2. In the top right corner, click on New Project
3. Fill out your project name and description and click Create
It will give you quite a few options on the side. You really aren’t interested in any of them except pipelines for this tutorial.
If you are unfamiliar with pipelines, then know that there are two main kinds of pipelines: build and release.
The build pipeline tells Azure where to go to build something. So in my case, I’m getting my code repo from git and building it on my Raspberry Pi. This creates a build artifact. Once you have a build artifact, you can publish/deploy it using the second main kind of pipeline – the release pipeline.
The release pipeline takes your build and publishes it to wherever you want it published to. In my case, I’m taking my build artifact from my Raspberry Pi and then publishing it to the web directory on the same Raspberry Pi.
So with our next steps, we need to set up a build pipeline and a release pipeline. The release pipeline will be covered in the next blog post.
You can have Azure spin up its own server for you to build stuff for every time you run the build Pipeline. It’s probably easier than doing what I’m about to show you. However, I didn’t want to incur any charges to the account I was using, so I needed to build on my own equipment. If you have a default account, you can use the Azure (I think it’s just the default one) agent pool with enough free build minutes that you probably won’t have to worry about the cost. If that’s the case, you can just skip down to where we set up the release Pipelines. It won’t make me sad because I don’t actually know you’re reading this in the first place.
1. Before you can create the agent, you need to create a personal access token so that your Pi can authenticate with Azure. To do this, click on the little user Icon next to your user badge in the top right. Then click on Profile.
2. Click on New Token, Then fill out the agent according to what’s on the screenshot (Your organization name is specific to your organization) and name it whatever you want. Then click Create.
3. Copy your Personal Access token. You will use it later when configuring your Raspberry Pi.
4. Agent Pools are not on a project level. They are an organizational thing, that way, if you have a build server, you can have a bunch of different projects use the same build server whenever you need it. So, go to your home page at dev.azure.com/azureaccount.
5. In the bottom left-hand corner, click on Organizational Settings
6. Go to Pipelines -> Agent pools
7. Click Add pool and add a name/description and submit
8. Now, you need to access azure from your Raspberry Pi. So, log in to your Raspberry Pi, and navigate to the Agent pool you just created
9. Now Click on Agents and click on New Agent
10. Select Linux and then ARM. Then click the Download button to download the agent
11. Then you want to run the commands listed from a terminal window on your raspberry pi.
mkdir myagent && cd myagenttar zxvf ~/Downloads/vsts-agent-linux-arm-2.166.3.tar.gz./config.sh
When you run this command, it’s going to ask you some questions
12. To see if the agent is online, go to dev.azure.com/organization -> Organization Settings (in the bottom left)
Click on the Agents tab to see if your agent is running. If it isn’t, then go to your terminal window where you installed it (in the case of this tutorial, it was installed at ~/myagent), run the command ./run.sh and it should soon enable your agent. If it still doesn’t work, you may have to recreate the build agent, or reboot the raspberry pi and try again.
1. Go to Pipelines on the side navigation menu, then click on New Pipeline in the top right of the screen.
2. There are two different ways that you can do an Azure Pipeline. YAML, or the Microsoft designer. Ideally, YAML gives you more control, but I chose the Microsoft designer way since it’s easier to start with. I also found YAML to be really boring. So, in my case, I had a Git repo on the very same Azure Account, but I chose Other Git for this so I could get the Microsoft designer features for the Pipeline. Note that you can switch to YAML if you want to later. However, if you choose any of the options tagged YAML, you can’t get any Microsoft designer features.
3. Now, you can select your Azure Git Repo here; just give it the information you need (If you are using another repository, select something else). Click Continue.
4. Next is your basic templates. Since this tutorial is running with a .NET Core application, I’d suggest selecting that just to get you started.
5. This gets you set up with a basic starter pipeline. There is one thing I recommend changing about the default, and it’s on the publish step. So click on the Publish step, and add -r linux-arm into the Arguments text box.
The Artifact staging directory doesn’t matter all that much because you are grabbing from that same directory in the release pipeline that we will be setting up later.
6. Click on Save (Not save and queue as we aren’t fully set up yet).
Now that the Pi is set up as an agent, it’s time to finish the pipeline build.
1. Click on your Pipeline, and select the Agent Pool that you made earlier.
2. Click Queue to run the Pipeline.
3. To see if your Pipeline is running, go back over to your Raspberry Pi and look at the agent that you started when you typed in /run.sh, it should look like this
4.  You can also view the status of the build by clicking on the running job in the Pipeline.
5. Now, if you’re me, you ran into this issue:
This means that you need to install node and npm. To do this, visit and follow the instructions on the npm site on your Raspberry Pi.
Note that on these instructions, it’s going to have you run a command tar gzipped file. I’ve found that this doesn’t work, and you may have to open up your file explorer, right-click on the downloaded file, and click on extract here for the step. Other than that, it will work just fine.
6. Queue the build again in Azure DevOps, and see what happens.
7. Note that with your first publish/build, it may take some time for it to gather all of the resources it needs (for me, it took about 8 minutes to build on the Raspberry Pi 4).
You still aren’t done. Why?
Well, what happens when your Pi reboots? You have to manually run the ./run.sh and dotnet command to spin up your solution. So, we need to create services to automatically restart those things when your Pi restarts; here’s how to do that.
1. Create a Service for your dotnet app (and replace any appname texts with your app name)
[Unit]Description=ASP.NET Core 3.1 App – App Name
[Service]WorkingDirectory=/var/www/appnameExecStart=/home/pi/dotnet/dotnet /var/www/appname/appname.dllRestart=always# Restart service after 10 seconds if the dotnet service crashes:RestartSec=10KillSignal=SIGINTSyslogIdentifier=dotnet-appnameUser=piEnvironment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=ProductionEnvironment=DOTNET_PRINT_TELEMETRY_MESSAGE=false
[Install]WantedBy=multi-user.target
sudo systemctl enable appName-kestrel.service
sudo systemctl start appName-kestrel.service
For me, I got a problem that happened where it kept on trying to run the site under https. I didn’t really want this to happen as I didn’t have https configured, so I went into my .net core Startup.cs and commented out this line, ​// app.UseHttpsRedirection();
Then I re-ran the build and copied it back to my web directory again.
After this, it should automatically start your web site even if your Pi has to reboot. There. One less thing to worry about.
2. The build service – this is a bit easier to do, just go to the directory you installed it on and run these commands (cd ~/myagent)
sudo ./svc.sh installsudo ./svc.sh start
3. You can then verify that it’s working by going to the Agent in Azure DevOps, it should say Online.
There. Phew. That was a long process to get the build server up and running. The next step is to set up your Pi release Pipeline. That way, your build can actually run as a website there. It’s kind of an involved process by itself…that’s why it’s in my other blog post.

How to Set up a Raspberry Pi III: Troubleshooting Issues
Is your Raspberry Pi not working correctly right after install? It’s ok; things will get better. After you do what I say, that is. Don’t feel bad if your Raspberry Pi doesn’t work right away, I had to troubleshoot about four or five times before I learned my lessons.
I’ve found that it usually boils down to something not loading correctly on the SD card. The problem I ran into when this happened was that I wasn’t sure if the Pi just didn’t like my monitor or if it really wasn’t working. It turns out there’s a way to find out!
See the little lights on the side of the Pi?
If only one of them is on and the other one never blinks, that means your Raspberry Pi isn’t starting up. Something is probably wrong with your SD card. Here’s how you can fix that.
If you are setting up the Raspberry Pi for the first time, I recommend doing this anyway.
1. Put the SD card into your computer. When you do this, you’ll probably get this warning. Just dismiss it, and if a dialog box opens, simply exit out of it.
2. Hit the Windows key and type in Disk Management. Click on Create and format hard disk partitions.
3. Make sure that you look at the disk that’s in your drive. If you get the wrong one, you could erase your own hard drive and anything that’s on your computer. I did this. It was very embarrassing, but mostly because I told everyone.
I’m using an 8 GB chip, so I know that it’s this disk.
4. For each of the Partitions in that disk, right-click and select Delete Volume… I can’t stress enough to make sure that you are deleting it under the correct disk.
5. After you are done, it should look like this.
6. Take out the SD card and put it back into your computer. You can try to open it, but it will error out. This is because it’s completely clean, and it doesn’t even know where to store things. That’s good because it’s the right state to run the installer in.
Once this is done, you’ll want to set up your Pi again. To do that, go to my tutorial for setting up the Raspberry Pi.

How to Set up a Raspberry Pi II: Enabling SSH on Raspberry Pi
Be sure to check out the first blog post in this series, How to Set up a Raspberry Pi: Getting Started, before diving into this post.
When I set up my Raspberry Pi, I thought it would be really nice to have something lightweight that I could use for monitoring and logging and running the occasional command. I didn’t want a full-blown remote desktop running the entire time (it can be sluggish at times, and it takes up a ton of screen real estate). Good thing for SSH.
Know what SSH is? I do! After a google search.
It’s Secure Shell. It means that you can access a terminal window without physically logging in to your Raspberry Pi.
Here’s what to do to get it set up.
1. You need your IP address. Find this by opening up a terminal and typing in hostname -I (mine was at 192.168.1.50)
2. Now go here and follow steps one and two to get this started.
3. Download a program called Putty on the computer that you want to access the Pi with.
4. Open up Putty after you install it, enter the IP address you found above, and save the information in the putty session by clicking save.
5. Then click on Open
6. It’s going to ask you for a username and password, the default username is pi, and the default password is raspberry.

How to Set up a Raspberry Pi I: Getting Started
In the world of the Internet of things (IoT), the most versatile thing is a full-blown computer. Most people (including myself) are too cheap for that, so the makers of Raspberry Pi decided to make a cheap computer that almost anyone can afford. Setting it up isn’t as easy as a normal computer. There are plenty of Raspberry Pi setup tutorials out there (I will be sending you to some of them), but few of them, in my opinion, will set you up from start to finish with a working computer.
Not only this, but if you are a web developer like me, you’ll want to host your own websites with this! This is one of many tutorials on setting up a web server on the Pi using the fun .NET Core. You don’t have to learn the less fun PHP that Linux likes so much.
Also, if you have no idea how Linux does all the things, I’m hoping this will get you through without having to know any Linux things that do stuff. Sure, you’ll have to open up a scary terminal window a couple of times, but I’ll walk you through it.
First, I like to be very obvious. You need a Raspberry Pi. But which one? There’s like a zillion of them!
Ok … more like 9. Anyways, it depends on what you want to do. If you’re just starting and you want to do things with a computer with the least amount of setup, go with the 3B+ (it’s a little cheaper). Otherwise, go with the 4. This tutorial will cover either of those.
When you want to figure out how much it costs, keep in mind it’s more than just the Pi. You’ll need some other components as well.
Any HDMI monitor will do, although I’ve had issues with some off-brand monitors not liking the Pi for some reason. I used a 4K 52” TV. It looked amazing in all of its tiny HD pixels.
Most of the USB keyboard/mice out there will do. I recommend one that lights up because it looks cool and makes you look like a pro.
You’ll need these things only for setup, so if they are hooked up to a computer you already own, you can use those, and I’ll show you how to remotely access it from another computer.
Disclaimer: Technically, don’t NEED any of these. There’s a way to set it up without it. However, I’ve tried it that way…over and over again with no success with different Pis and versions of its Operating system. If you like to experience repeated failure at a higher rate than I could tolerate, then I suggest not getting a keyboard/mouse/monitor.
If you have a Pi 4. You need a USB-C charger (or the charger to your phone if it was built in the last couple of years)
If you have a Pi 3B+. You need a plain old mini-USB charger.
I wouldn’t use anything less than 16GB – I tried an 8 (they said you can do that), and I quickly ran out of space with the libraries I was using. Most of these come with an adapter.
But WHY?
A Raspberry Pi is not like other computers. It boots off of this one mini-SD card. Get one. It will not run without it. I’ve also found that if you buy a kit to set up your Raspberry Pi with stuff already set up for you on it, it may not actually work. You’ll have to wipe it if that’s the case.
Like the one in the screenshot above, you can also use one of those flash Drive -> SD card adapters.
You’ll need a WiFi network to download all of the updates you need.
You also need a plain old HDMI cable to hook the Pi up to a monitor.
Notes:
After you get all that stuff, here’s how to set it up.
You need to get the latest Operating System installed on the Pi. The Pi most commonly runs on Debian (Also known as Raspbian, and it has a bunch of different versions). That’s the OS I’ll walk you through here.
Fun fact: each version of Debian is named after a Toy Story character.
If you have a Pi3, you can’t use the latest version of Debian, you need to use the Stretch version of Debian (Some random octopus character from Toy Story 3). For the Pi 4, you want to run the Buster version of Debian (the puppy from Toy Story 2).
1. Insert your SD Card, then open up your file explorer, and it will show up on the left.
Yours might show up as the letter D as I have more than one drive on my PC.
You can download the imager for your little SD card by going here; it’s the first link on the page. Note that you might not be able to access it. That’s because you might not even have a partition on your SD card, and that’s ok; just keep going.
2. Install the program from downloads. Once it finishes, it will open the program.
3. You want to select the first option (Raspbian) for this tutorial. (I’m not sure all of the limitations on this, but I do know that I’m running a web server with .NET Core/REACT and a build/release agent on it, so regular Raspbian (a version of Debian) can handle all that).
4. When you select the SD Card, remember that drive letter from step 3? Select that drive.
5. Then click on Write – note that this can take a little bit – I have a fairly fast laptop, and it took me 5-10 minutes to complete.
6. After this is done, take out your SD card and put the mini-SD into the little slot at the bottom of the Raspberry Pi.
7. When you’re done, the setup instructions on the pi will help you connect to a network and change your password.
8. After that’s done to make sure you have the latest version of whatever version of Debian (If you got Buster, it would give you the latest and greatest Buster, if you go with Stretch, the latest and greatest Stretch). To do this, you have to open up the scary Terminal window.
Next, run these commands to start the upgrade process:
sudo apt updatesudo apt full-upgrade
These commands could take a while. So go get a sandwich. Then type in the following command:
sudo reboot
When you run this, your Pi will restart, so don’t freak out when everything goes black.
9. Congratulations, you did something. Your computer works.
These things are all well and good, but what if something doesn’t go right? I had a bad SD Card, my monitor wasn’t working, and the installation didn’t work the first time. If this sounds like something that happened to you see, keep an eye out for part 3 of this series, where I give a tutorial on how to wipe an SD Card.
Also, If you aren’t burnt out on setting up your Raspberry Pi, you can set up a remote desktop. This lets you log in to your Pi if it’s on the same network as your computer. It will display a screen of your Raspberry Pi that you can do whatever you want in without actually having to run a dedicated monitor/keyboard/mouse. That way, you can just be cheap and use them for setting up the Raspberry Pi and use the other stuff on a computer you actually care about. If that’s something you want to set up, go here. It’s probably the best tutorial that I’ve found.

.NET Core 3.1 with Kontent.ai – Part 1: Clean Architecture Design
Welcome to Part 1 of my series on .NET Core Kontent.ai websites! I love working with .Net Core and Kontent, so this series will focus on giving you the tools you need to create awesome products. We’ll start at the place where all successful projects should begin from a development perspective: with a look at what type of architecture is going to position us for success based on the project’s technical requirements.
Architecting your solutions properly is important. In Robert C Martin’s Clean Architecture, he states the goal of software architecture is “to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system”. Trying to make changes to a project that has bad architecture is a bit like gluing together your legos: worked great the first time you did it but is a real headache if you need to make any changes! 😬
If you’re like me, there’s always THAT PROJECT that you dread making changes to because changing one thing is like pulling out a bottom piece on a teetering Jenga tower, one wrong move and everything comes crashing down.
Now imagine your boss saying there’s a critical feature malfunctioning in THAT PROJECT and YOU need to fix it right away before the company bleeds too much money! 😵
Eager to solve the critical problem, you rip open the codebase, take one look at the code, and the nightmares of the last time you had to change something in this project come rushing back.
You psych yourself up, thinking “I can do this!” Remembering the Jenga tower you formulate a plan of attack, in and out with lightning speed, fixing the issue quickly and efficiently with no casualties. Here’s your plan for the change:
But as soon as one unforeseen force hits you, everything crumbles around you and it ends up being more like this:
This is what bad architecture can do to your project, it can cripple it making the easiest changes difficult and risky.
In this post, we’ll review the architecture of a production .Net Core 3.1 MVC website with a Kontent.ai headless CMS. We’ll review a SOLID architecture that’s easy to scale and maintain. We’ll cover which projects you’ll want to add, what each project does, and why each project is important.
Normally we’d look at the project requirements and goals first, evaluating which technologies would be good fits for the requirements. For the purpose of this article, we’ll assume the technology requirements are already chosen.
The goal of this architecture is to segregate the Kentico dependencies in a repository layer so the remainder of the project has no dependencies on Kentico, the external API doubling as our data layer.
Sean Wright outlines a similar architecture for Kentico 12 MVC, N-Tier Architecture – Layers as Abstractions, in his excellent blog post, Kentico 12: Design Patterns Part 20 – Choosing a Solution Architecture.
I love all of the examples you can find online. Reading other peoples’ articles and reviewing other projects on open source platforms like GitHub has really taught me a lot about what good software architecture looks like. A great example, complete with automated tests, is the Kontent.ai Boilerplate repo for ASP.NET Core MVC. Like most projects online, for simplicity, their HomeController performs all of the logic: it queries the database, creates objects, and returns the object mashed together with the view back to the browsers.
Although great, for example, projects, this can break things like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) or the Open Closed Principle. Joe does a great job of explaining why query logic (or any logic) in your controllers could be troublesome in his blog post, Visualizing Thin ASP.Net Controllers via SOLID Principles. Basically, there can be more than one reason for this code to change; you can’t test the controller or logic in isolation, it can lead to god methods, and the query isn’t reusable.
Kentico has done a great job and giving you all the tools you need to query their headless CMS, Kontent, including the heavy hitter, IDeliveryClient. This interface alone will give you enough power to do nearly everything you need to do to get data from Kontent. 💪
In order to call Kentico’s DeliveryClient from your controller, you need to install the Kontent Delivery SDK. Since this is functioning as our data access layer, we are going to create a Kontent. Repository layer that will have all of the dependencies needed to interact with the Kontent API map the results to domain objects and return them without any references to Kentico to the UI layer. Whenever you have an external API, you should consider an abstraction like this around the code with tight coupling to the API. This allows you to only change your repository layer when those external dependencies inevitably change, rather than changing every layer of your project. The UI layer shouldn’t care if the database layer changes underneath it!
The Common Reuse Principle states
Don’t force users of a component (dll in our case) to depend on things they don’t need.
I don’t want to have to install the entire Kontent Delivery SDK in every piece of my project!
You can see here that the Web, Infrastructure and Repository projects depend on Core, but do not depend on each other. We’ll use the D of SOLID, Dependency Inversion Principle, to inject the concrete classes the Web, Infrastructure, and Repository layers need without adding dependencies to those projects by putting only the interfaces in core! 🤠
The most important rule of the Dependency Inversion Principle is:
Don’t refer to volatile concrete classes. Refer to abstract interfaces instead. This rule applies in all languages, whether statically or dynamically typed.
If you use a new keyword, chances are you’re probably violating this principle.
There are two ways data can flow through the layers of this application. For Create/Update/Read/Delete (CRUD) pass through style calls, the UI layer calls an IRepository interface directly (green arrows). If our application has additional business logic that’s required, like an EmailService, we implement that business logic in our Infrastructure project. In these cases, the web layer calls an IService that resides in the Infrastructure project, which then can call IRepository data access layer if it needs to (blue arrows).
Although this project doesn’t have a traditional database, this architecture also works well for applications that do!
This project is the .Net Core 3.1 web application. It contains
This project is also responsible for the dependency injection container configuration. However, I would consider moving this logic into a Mapping or Bootstrap layer because it requires references to all concrete classes in order to tell the application how to resolve the interfaces. Here’s a snippet of the code required to setup dependency injection for Kontent’s IDeliveryClient. IDeliveryClient, CachedDeliveryClient, ProjectOptions, DeliveryOptions, ITypeProvider are all from Kentico and therefore require a Kentico dependency.
This project is the business logic layer that contains concrete implementations of services.
This layer should not depend on the Web or Repository layers. It can call the repository layers via IRepositories that are injected into it.
This project is a repository layer for Kontent. The purpose of this project is to abstract Kentico API calls and models into its own layer for use throughout the application.
This layer enables a software system to interact with external systems by receiving, storing, and providing data when requested.
The output of this layer are Core models designed with Domain Driven Design in mind, with no references to Kentico.
If you have additional data sources, add another repository layer. When we wanted to add Azure Search to our project, we created a Demo.Search.Repository. If a service needs information from both, call both repository layers and consolidate the result in a core model and return the core model to the Web layer.
This project is the core layer where the domain models or core models live. It also houses all interfaces for the project.
The purpose of this project is to hold all of the automapping profiles, so the application knows how to map Kontent models to core models. We also started to migrate some of the dependency injection registration here but did not complete it.
In Part 2, we’ll look at the code associated with this architecture and trace a request from a controller down into the repository layer and back up to the UI. 🙌

.NET Core 3.1 with Kontent.ai – Part 2: Clean Architecture Implementation
In Part 1 of my series on .Net Core Kontent.ai websites, we covered a recommended SOLID architecture for .Net Core websites.
One of the goals of the architecture was to abstract all querying logic from the controller layers of the Kontent Boilerplate repo for ASP.NET Core MVC behind a repository layer so that they were isolated and our code didn’t depend on them. We’d then use Automapper to map the Kontent class to a clean core model based on Domain Driven Design, returning the core model to our UI layer.
If we needed additional business logic, we had an Infrastructure layer for any services like Email or Recaptcha.
In this segment, we’ll take a peek at what the code looks like to accomplish this. Let’s dive in!
The HomeController lives in the Web project. Notice there is very little logic in the controller. It does 3 things: call the homePageRepository interface, return a NotFound 404 if no home page domain models were returned from the repository and return the view with the homePage domain model.
After some debate, we chose to send core models out to the view layer rather than create a bunch of additional ViewModels in the Web layer to save on development time and mapping logic.  Our core models were simple, so we were ok with this.  When a view needs more than one model, we created a wrapper core model.  Each View displays core models.
Here’s some of that Dependency Inversion Principle at work, IHomepageRepository is injected, so the controller has dependencies on the interfaces in core instead of the class in the repository layer.
In your startup.cs or your bootstrapper project, you can setup auto registration so any interface with the same name as a concrete class will automatically get configured. You can also see the Automapper config below.
Startup.cs
Boostrapper
All interfaces live in Core.
And its concrete implementation lives in Demo.KenticoKontent.Repository
As long as the Homepage is already defined in Kontent, you can use the Kentico model generator to generate a C# class that the SDK will automatically serialize the JSON response from the API into. It looks something like this and lives in the repository layer. We decided to put this in the repository layer because it’s tightly coupled to the Kontent API call, and it has Kentico SDK dependencies.
The Kentico dependencies are almost hidden here. 🧐 Asset and ContentItemSystemAttributes are both classes provided by the Kontent SDK.
The domain model we created to return this data to the UI is Homepage.cs and it lives in the Core project under the Models namespace.
The mapping logic lives in Demo.Mapping
Now you have a good idea of how to setup dependency injection to upload the Dependency Inversion Principle and how to segregate your code in the appropriate layers to enable easy maintenance in the future! 😻
In Part 3, we’ll look at how we can architect Kontent’s linked items to have our codebase automatically generate URLs and route to them based on what type of content is linked.

Improve Entity Framework Query Performance With Dapper
Entity Framework is one of the most popular ORM frameworks in the .NET world, and for good reason. It’s generally quick and easy to get started doing basic CRUD operations, performance is acceptable for most use cases, and at version 6.3 for the full .NET Framework, it is very mature and stable. However, for more complex queries, it is common to run into some performance issues.In this blog post, I will detail the steps I took to reduce the time to complete a query using Entity Framework, and then ultimately how I used another .NET ORM framework called Dapper to further increase query performance.
Recently I worked on a project for users to track hundreds of data points about their clients, and then create complex reports using that data. Clients would have demographic information such as age, gender, household type, and others spread across normalized database tables. They would also have multiple “assessment” collections tied to them, where users would input data about their clients’ health, income, and other factors.The model would look something like this:
…only with many more assessment types (each of which contained their own nested object properties).Since most of the reports the users needed to generate would reference all the various assessments and other nested objects within the Client, I decided the best way to handle this would be to query the database once and populate all these nested properties, then pass this collection to the report service where the calculations are performed.This looked something like this:
…only with many more. Include() statements added.When Entity Framework builds this query, it will use SQL “JOIN”s to get the one-to-one mappings such as “HouseholdType”. However, when it gets the collections, it will perform a “UNION ALL” across all the assessments and their various properties. Depending on how many collections you need to include and how many properties/nested objects they contain, this can create one huge ugly query that is not very performant. With hundreds of clients containing dozens of assessments, this query would take a few minutes to complete in our testing.
The first thing I tried to remedy this issue was to drop the .Include() statements for the nested collections, and instead loop through the clients and manually call “Load” on them.That looked like this:
This method will make a call to the database for each collection. In our testing, it did shave about 30 seconds off the total query time, but that wasn’t quite enough for my liking. I had heard of the performance benefits of Dapper, so at this point, I had decided to give it a try.
With Dapper, you write the SQL query yourself and write code to tell it how to map the results of your query to your models. To do this with collections, I used the QueryMultiple extension, as shown below:
To my surprise, loading my nested objects this way reduced our total query time from 2-3 minutes down to 6 seconds!As you can see, it is easy to include Dapper alongside an existing Entity Framework project. All I had to do was install the Dapper NuGet package and then add “using Dapper;” to my namespace imports at the beginning of my code.

Cache Busting with AspNetCore TagHelpers
Caching of client-side files is a functionality that, when properly implemented, can greatly improve the load speed and perceived responsiveness of your web application for end-users. In this blog post, I’ll go over enabling the Cache-Control header for static files. I’ll also show you how to implement an ASP.NET Core Tag Helper that can be used to fingerprint static file URLs to enable browser cache-busting when those files change on the server.
To cache static files in .NET Core, the Cache-Control HTTP header must set in response to a request for a file. This is done by configuring a StaticFileOptions object and passing it to the UseStaticFiles( IApplicationBuilder app, StaticFileOptions options ) override within your startup file:
More information on how the Static Files middleware functions can be found on ms-docs.
This would reduce requests needed for a browser to load a page if a static file had been requested on a previous navigation. However, if that file changes on the server, the browser won’t redownload it until a year after the first time it downloaded it (MaxAge). For the file caching to be effective, we need the means to force the browser to re-download a cached file if it has changed on the server. This is typically done via fingerprinting: adding a unique value to the URL requested by the browser based on the requested file.
When using a build tool like webpack, we can configure the tool to fingerprint (append a unique hash) to the file name at build time. This is great for SPAs but extremely cumbersome for Mvc applications, where a developer would need to continually update a script tag to point to the correct version of a file.
“What if the script element could update itself?”
This is where Tag Helpers come into play. Tag Helpers are similar to MVC  HTML Helpers but in a syntax that blurs the lines between HTML, Razor, and C#. They enable an MVC developer to customize/override the rendering of HTML elements and/or element attributes.
Using the HtmlTargetElementAttribute, we can define a Tag Helper that targets img, link, and script elements, in order to define a custom cache-* attribute, which will result in the attribute’s value (a URL to a file) to be fingerprinted:
The first step in implementing this Tag Helper is to define a method that can be used for generating the fingerprint (file hash) that will be used to make the URL to the file unique. In ASP.NET Core, file system access has been abstracted through File Providers and the common IFileProvider interface. The Static File middleware uses this abstraction to locate static files and write them to responses. We’ll also use this abstraction to locate static files in order to create a unique hash of them using the IFileProvider.GetFileInfo( string ) method. This method returns an IFileInfo object and is the type upon which we’ll define a generic extension method for generating a file hash using a specified HashAlgorithm:
Now that we have a generic method that can be used to generate a file hash or fingerprint, our next step is to define the Tag Helper that will replace the usage of cache-* attributes on img, link, and script elements with the proper attributes for those elements.
With the code there to swap out the usage of a cache-href/cache-src attribute with href/src attributes, we can now implement the code that will retrieve an IFileInfo object and generate the fingerprinted URL. Due to some static files being quite large, such as images, we will update our Tag Helper with a dependency on ASP.NET’s IDistributedCache abstraction so that we can cache the file’s hash. This will prevent the app from performing expensive reads + computations required to calculate the hash on every request.
IDistributedCache is used to handle scaling (load balancing). For a more straightforward implementation, you may consider using the IMemoryCache abstraction.

Angular Click Elsewhere Directive
Have you ever needed a custom drop down menu where it’s dropdown state could be toggled based on click events? Maybe you’ve already developed a working solution using native DOM functionality or a library such as jQuery. If not, no problem!Our goal is to write some code that will allow us to execute a callback function when we click “elsewhere” or outside of a target element’s descendant elements. We want our functionality to be reusable amongst multiple target elements such as custom dropdown menus. Oh, and we’re using Angular 4.In summary, we want to use an Attribute Directive on our target element that sets up a Host Listener that listens for a click Mouse Event on the Document and emits the Mouse Event if the element being clicked is not a descendant of our target element. Our template containing the target element will bind a callback function to this mouse event and close the dropdown menu.That was a bit of a mouthful. Let’s break it down.
What is an Attribute Directive? According to the official Angular docs at the time of this writing, Attribute Directives change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.So, like the definition states, we will be changing the behavior of our target element. We want our target element to emit an event when there is a mouse click outside of any of its descendant elements. Let’s take a look at our directive definition before we add any functionality to it.
Using the @Directive decorator we can decorate a class as an Angular Directive. Notice the selector value: ‘[clickElsewhere]’. Since we want to be able to use this directive as an attribute on our target element, we are using square brackets which will select the attribute named ‘clickElsewhere’.We also inject a reference to the target element that this directive is attached to using ElementRef. The reference to the target element is possible via the normal Angular dependency injection pipeline.
Let’s add a few more things to our directive:
As you can see, we’ve imported a few more things from the @angular/core package that we need to complete this implementation: EventEmitter, HostListener and Output.We’ve created a property called clickElsewhere and decorated it with the @Output() decorator to let Angular know this is an output property. This property is an EventEmitter and based on its type parameter: MouseEvent, it will emit mouse events. Event Emitters allow us to emit events up to our containing components. Notice the name of the output property we’ve created has the exact same as the selector for our directive: clickElsewhere. This allows us to use a very concise syntax when using this directive in a template, which we will see later.Finally, we’ve defined an onDocumentClick function and decorated it with the @HostListener decorator. The Host Listener allow us to listen to an event on the host – which is the target element that this directive will be attached to. The first parameter of the @HostListener decorator is the event name. The second parameter is an array of arguments that are emitted in the event. Since we want to listen to click events on the whole document and not just the directive’s host, we went a step further and added document as our target before the click event name: document:click.The @HostListener decorator also passes the arguments, $event in our case, into the function it’s decorating. So, our function will have one parameter: event, which will be of type MouseEvent.Our function is pretty simple, it checks to see if the element being clicked on is NOT contained within the element that our directive is attached to. If the user clicked elsewhere or outside of the element that our directive is attached to, then we emit the mouse event as an output. To achieve this, we are taking advantage of the EventEmitter to emit the mouse event as our Output property.
Now that we have our directive setup we are ready to use it in a template. We would like to bind a callback function to the event that gets emitted–when the user clicks outside of the element we are attaching our directive to. I’ve set up a simple example that calls an openDropdown() function when the user clicks on a target div. When the user clicks elsewhere, a closeDropdown() function is called.
It’s as simple as that! You can see the concise syntax that I mentioned earlier:(clickElsewhere)=”closeDropdown()”. We are doing two things at once here. The first thing we’re doing is adding an attribute to the div called clickElsewhere which allows angular to find our directive by a selector: @Directive({ selector: ‘[clickElsewhere]’ }). The second thing we’re doing is binding the closeDropdown() callback function to the @Output() property in our directive that is also called clickElsewhere. Since the directive’s selector and output property both share the same name we are able to do this with a nice short syntax.If our directive’s selector and output property had different names, we would have to declare the selector attribute on the target element, and bind to the output property separately. So, if we were to rename the output property to clickOff, we would have to use the directive like this:
If you are writing a directive where you plan to have multiple output events that you’d like to bind to, then the second syntax is going to be required. If you are writing a simple directive that does one thing, like we are in this example, you can leverage this concise syntax and have the template be a bit more readable.I hope by taking the time to read through this example, you learned something new about the Angular pipeline!

Your First Day on the Job at BizStream
I don’t know about you but I have had some less than stellar first days on the job, where the day is full of paperwork and downtime sitting around waiting on managers or others to “get around to me.” It sort of makes sense right? You’re new, you don’t really understand the nuances of the company, your position, or even the technology you’re using. I wonder if it’s just a foregone conclusion that your day is just going to be that, paperwork and sitting around? But does it have to be that way?
I have also started my first day with less than stellar equipment, few or no accounts or nothing at all, just a blank desk. At some point in the day someone will walk by and say, “Oh I guess we need to get you some things.” I have been at companies that view this as some odd right of passage, or I am told, “it’s just the way it is.” Why is that? I am sure in most instances it was not intentional, but sometimes managers are just so relieved to find someone to fill the position they forget about how it feels to be the “n00b” on your first day. BizStream, being a small company, has run into some of these same challenges, so we started an “Onboarding” team to alleviate or lessen some of these issues and make the first day a better experience for everyone.
You only get one first day, you only get one first impression: why not make it as awesome as possible?
Just like the potential team member wants to make a good impression during their interview, wouldn’t you want to show off your best as a department, team, or company? After all, you spent a lot of time and effort to find that right person to help backfill, maintain, or take your company to the next level. Why would you want them to question if they made the right move?
When I started at BizStream I noticed that we were not consistent on how new team members were brought in. Now, to the leadership’s credit, I was greatly impressed that they had thought it out and had a roughed out task list. The issue was it was not formalized or inclusive enough to make things consistent even though it far exceeded some other companies I had worked for. I have had good success in previous roles with bringing people in, so I wrote up a quick one page outline and shared it with a few people internally. This led to a larger discussion and our Onboarding team was formed.
As a team we talked about what needed to happen, at minimum, on a team member’s first day. We talked about the good and bad of our first days at other companies and we developed what is now our standard Onboarding schedule.
Our team decided that we wanted, at minimum, the first day completely scheduled out for the new team member. Now, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t any downtime, but it is minimal. If you know BizStream, you know we are not into a formal, corporate, schedule your every waking moment kind of thing, but we made an exception here to help facilitate a lasting first impression.
We started by reviewing who needed to be involved in bringing on a new team member. Our current team looks like this: Office Manager, HR, Building Manager, Project Manager, IT. Each one of these team members has a vital role in “onboarding” a new team member. Each time we bring on a new team member we meet as a team with the hiring manager and someone from our Leadership Team to ensure that we understand all the expectations that were laid out during the hiring process, review any specific details, and set the schedule for the team member’s first day. This way everyone is on the same page and no one is blindsided on the day of. This is typically not a long meeting, typically only taking 30 minutes or less.
Overview: Below is a sample document that is printed out and left on the new team member’s desk as well as emailed to the hiring manager and the Onboarding team. This ensures that at any point during the day, anyone of these people can help the new team member through their day. The actual first day agenda document will have photos of the team members that the new hire is scheduled to meet with. I have found this to be exceptionally helpful as new team members are bombarded with data the whole day. It’s nice to be able to put a face with a name and if you need to find someone, to know what they look like.
First off, you will notice that we ask our new team member to start their first day at 9. You are asking yourself why do you give them a free hour on their first day? Typically most of our new team members start on a Monday. How many times have you walked into the office after a weekend and you have nothing but fires to put out? What if you were caught in traffic, or your kid spills milk all over you just as you’re about to leave? My experience is that new team members will try and show up early on their first day, now you as a manager, are already stressed due to the above or any other myriad of reasons. By having them start at 9 this helps not transfer that stress to the new team member and allows the manager to give them their full attention.
We will get into gear and accounts a little later, but with most people they like their desk a certain way, they like specific items on their desktop or want to import their browser favorites. This is a great time for them to do that and make their workspace their own and of course, to grab a cup of coffee.
We have a fantastic and unique office, and our team members really like it. We typically show people around when we interview, but we want the new team member to be familiar with where things are. They are going to be here eight or more hours a day, it’s nice not to have to hunt for things or ask every time, “where is that conference room?” Our office manager, Michelle, takes the new team member around and shows off our uniqueness, and the nuances of our office.
Every Monday we have a company meeting in which we discuss personal highlights in our “List of Awesome” as well as what business is upcoming for the week or month, what is new in the sales cycle, what things are being rolled out, marketing, events and a check-in to see if anyone has too much or not enough work. This is a great and relaxed time in which we all introduce ourselves to the new team member and where the new team member can get a 30,000 foot view of what our company is doing.
You can’t get around it, so it’s here. Amanda, our HR manager and Bookkeeper is great and keeps things as light and painless as filling out the handbook, insurance, and W4s can be!
What better way to bring on a new team member than to take them out to lunch on the company their first day? We are a team and a family at BizStream so we try and get to know our new team members on multiple levels. Lunch usually includes the hiring manager, one of both of the owners, and some or all of the team the new team member will be working with. Again, we are family so lunch includes lots of razzing and laughter about whatever is on our plates that week.
Our building manager also happens to be in charge of Quality Assurance (QA). Josh will review how to access the building, reemphasize where some key things are, and then discuss how our QA team handles projects.
That’s me, Blair. I like to discuss the software and hardware we use. Where to find things on our corporate file share, how to access our development servers, and how to access our VPN. This can sometimes get bogged down in a lot of technical stuff so I push to keep it light and short unless there are specific questions.
Mike, our Operations Lead, will take the new team member through our typical project process, walk them through our project management software, and show them how and where to track their work time. Every company does project management differently and each project manager leads projects a little differently. We find it helpful to be upfront as possible on how this works at BizStream in order to ease the new team member into our processes and reduce confusion.
We primarily use a Content Management System (CMS) named Kentico for most of the websites our team builds. BizStream has it’s own standards on how to implement Kentico and it’s code, so the rest of the day is dedicated to working through these standards and getting used to Kentico.
The Friday afternoon of the new team member’s first week we schedule a social hour. This is a time for everyone to grab a featured drink, chosen by the new team member, get to know the new team member, and relax as a team.
BizStream is obviously a tech company and we love our tech! As a new full time team member you get a laptop with the same specs as every other developer. You don’t get a hand me down because the IT guy wanted a new machine, you get a clean machine that is not more than a year old, and is packed with the same amount of power as anyone else in the company. We give you at least three 24″ screens connected to a dock, so taking your laptop to and from meetings is as painless as possible.
As a perk, you get to select the keyboard and mouse that you want to work with. It’s just another way that BizStream allows you to customize your workspace to fit your individual taste. The desk is full of BizStream goodies when you arrive. Our swag stock changes from time to time but a new team members can expect things like coffee mugs, travel mugs, sunglasses, pens, notepads, bottle openers and the like.
We strive to have all of the necessary accounts built for the new team member before they arrive. We use lots of software in our jobs, both in-house and in the cloud. I do my best to configure all those sign-ons to connect to one of two authentication platforms so when a new team member starts, they don’t have a sheet of 20 different passwords to commit to memory. If I did my job right, it’s one, sometimes two passwords, connected to a single sign-on (SSO) store.
We want to know what works, what didn’t, or what could be tweaked to make the experience for the next new team member that much better. About 30 days after the first day, we send out a quick survey that asks questions about your first day and first week on the job. We keep it short and light but we really do desire the feedback to make sure we are on the right track. The Onboarding team reviews each survey and makes improvements as necessary.
BizStream does not have all the right answers. Our team meets regularly to discuss what works what doesn’t. We have gone through several iterations to get the process to where it is now. Not all things described here will work for all companies, but I think it’s a good starting point to evaluate if you could be doing a better job as a team, department or company.

4 Entity Framework EDMX Tips to Help You Out of a Jam
Have you ever tried to change the structure of your database, or include a new table in your database-first EDMX, only to find that when you go to rebuild your solution you get about 1,837 new errors? “How can this be?!”, you might ask. “The database is setup right! The code worked fine 2 minutes ago! I just added a new table to the EDMX and everything blows up!”.
Here’s the thing: Visual Studio and Entity Framework aren’t perfect yet, and the wizard for adding/refreshing/removing objects from the EDMX isn’t smart enough to handle everything you throw at it. It gets confused fairly easily, to tell you the truth. Sometimes you need to take your superior human brain into the XML guts, root around, and fix some messes. Here’s how.I want to take a second here to remind you to backup, branch, or at least commit your code while it’s in a good state. You’re going to be messing with complicated XML and if you delete the wrong thing, or change the structure incorrectly you could have a hard time fixing it. You might have to revert and start again. You have been warned…Right-click on your EDMX file, select Open With…, then select XML (Text) Editor. Boom, there is your entire EDMX file as Visual Studio and .Net sees it, in all its XML wonderfulness.
As I said above, the EF wizard isn’t all that smart about changing existing entities. If you change your database structure and remove a field or two then refresh your model, chances are those fields are still going to be hanging around in your models causing confusion. You’re going to need to do the wizard’s job and remove those fields for good.Using the instructions above, open up your EDMX as XML. Search the text for the name of the field you changed/removed. It will appear 4-5 times if it’s a normal field, and considerably more if it’s any kind of primary/foreign key. Go through all instances and modify the XML to your liking for each. In the case of removing a field, you’ll just remove all traces of that field the EDMX file.
As you probably know, every time you hit save while looking at the EDMX diagram, Visual Studio spins for a couple seconds. It’s actually looking at the XML we just talked about and deciding whether it needs to change any of your generated classes as a result. It doesn’t always do the best job of changing existing classes. Sometimes you might have done something to confuse it and it doesn’t update the classes as you’d expect. For instance, take removing or renaming a field from your database as an example. You don’t want to modify those generated classes, because at some point you’ll regenerate them and all your changes will be overwritten. You might just want to have VS start over and try again from scratch.To do this, find the [YourDatabase].tt file (not to be confused with the [YourDatabase].Context.tt file), and expand the cs files below it. You’ll see one file for each database table you’ve imported. Highlight all of the files and delete them all. Trust me, it will be ok. Once deleted, right-click on the [YourDatabase].tt file and select Run Custom Tool. Give it a few seconds to think and all your classes will be regenerated again.
Visual Studio’s default EDMX process is great, but it can’t foresee every nuance of every custom database. One example is multiple relationships to the same table. For instance, in my legacy application I sometimes have tables with multiple relationships back to the user table. (A table with fields like CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy, SubmittedBy, etc.) The generated class will contain objects like User, User1, User2, etc. Not really helpful when you’re using those classes in code. You can do a few things to make your generated classes more helpful. Let’s dive into the T4 templates.Open the [YourDatabase].tt (T4 Template) file. This contains the template used to generate all the classes for your database tables. In it, you’ll see each part of a class file with other methods and properties sprinkled in. You can do a ton of cool things inside this file to help make your generated classes easier to use. I’m going to show you one of these neat tricks.Search the file for “foreach (var navigationProperty in navigationProperties)”. This is going to loop through all the relationships (navigation properties) in the class it’s working on. A little farther down you’ll see <#=codeStringGenerator.NavigationProperty(navigationProperty)#>. This is going to output the property text, think public User User3 { get; set; }. Right above that line we’re going to add:
This is going to add a summary block above each navigation property including the relationship name (foreign key name). This summary block is included in the intellisense displayed when you hover over the relationship while typing out code. If you have your foreign keys named decently, you can use this to help you figure out which User (User, User1, User2, User3, etc) is CreatedBy, LastModifiedBy, SubmittedBy, etc.
To summarize, Visual Studio makes working with Entity Framework pretty easy but it still has a way to go. Hopefully this post will help make up for a few of the places it falls short.

BizStream Goes Solar
Sometime last month, BizStream went dark, and we couldn’t have been more excited because the darkness came as our newly installed solar panels were being hooked up!
Going solar has been a goal of BizStream’s for a while now. As a tech company, we love the idea of leaning into this new(ish) technology. But, beyond the techy, fun stuff, we had many other reasons for harnessing solar power.
Another deciding factor in our decision to go solar is based on our Founder’s personal experience, Mark Schmidt. Mark went solar at his home in 2019 after seeing the benefits his parents experienced once they made the switch. Noting the affordability and the collective energy output throughout all the seasons in Michigan, Mark was confident that solar was a great way to reach BizStream’s goal of becoming a more environmentally friendly company.
I've always been interested in alternative energy (solar, wind, water, movement, etc.). I've done small personal solar/battery projects at home on my gazebo, so I could listen to music and run a ceiling fan out there. I've always wanted to do it on my house and business, but financially, it never made sense due to the cost of batteries. However, once I realized there was 1-to-1 net metering available, it became an option to explore. We are pretty much using the utility company as the battery. We generate power for the utility company, and they credit us. They supply us with electricity, but it is 100% paid for by the credits. This works great because we over-produce in the summer and under-produce in the winter. It all balances out with the credits.
Actually, yeah! While The Mitten only comes in 35th on the 2021 sunniest states list, and we only get an average of 170 sunny days per year, there are plenty of reasons to soak up the sun’s energy here.
Our team started planning for this project back in 2019. With the guidance of Tiger Solar, BizStream landed on 224 solar modules. The system is expected to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce 88,977kW annually.
Check out the final installation with Tiger Solar’s drone footage.
There are many factors to keep in mind when considering moving to solar energy. The incentives and grant opportunities seem to be forever changing, and of course, they will depend on your location. Tiger Solar did a lot of the leg work when it came to finding the best grants to apply for, navigating the latest laws and regulations, and working with the utility company to get everything squared away. If you’re located in Virginia, Idaho, Maryland, DC, or Michigan, we highly recommend consulting with them. If you’re located in a different state, we’d suggest finding a reputable company that will advocate for you and help you navigate your project.
Our ultimate goal is to get entirely off the grid, allowing us to avoid blackouts during storms, downtime during maintenance work, etc. However, it financially doesn’t make sense for BizStream to do so at this time due to the high costs of batteries. Advancements in traditional battery technology have been slow-moving up until the last few decades. In the past few years, though, scientists worldwide continue to look into many alternative battery technologies, even one’s that harness plant waste energy! That seems promising, right?! Either way, we’re keeping an eye on battery advancements and hope to utilize them when the time and technology are right for us.

The Easy Way to Use SvcUtil.exe With a Large XML Schema
If you’ve ever used SvcUtil.exe to generate even a slightly complicated WCF Service, you know how annoying it is to gather up all your imported Xsd’s and list them after the command. I have no idea why, but SvcUtil.exe is too stupid to be able to figure out relative links on your local filesystem. Take heart, however, there are a few different ways to let SvcUtil know about your XML schema.
Go through each and every imported WSDL and XSD file, making a list of all the full paths to each imported file. As you probably know, since you’ve Googled this far, this can be super annoying and time-consuming when you have a large XML schema.
Write a little utility app to do the heavy lifting for you. Recursively parse the text of each file, storing the full path and finding more files to parse. This is ok, but it just forces you to write and maintain more code.
While SvcUtil.exe can’t seem to figure out relative links on your local filesystem, it seems to have no problem when your schema is hosted. A quick and easy way to take advantage of this is to create a local IIS website with your schema as the Physical Path. Then, when you pass your WSDL to SvcUtil, you use the URL instead. Bingo, all your relatively linked XSD files are picked up and your service is created!Using the easy way, your SvcUtil.exe command goes from this:
to this:
As you can see it is a lot nicer only having to worry about loading in your resources from the URL-based version.

By centering on the customer in this way, we were able to focus our resources on reaching the right audience, improving the likelihood of successful conversions.

Mike Kren
Mike has been managing large-scale projects for the better part of the last 11 years. His passion is bringing order to the chaos to keep everyone on the same page and the work moving forward.
I have been managing large-scale projects since 2006 and am a certified Project Manager and Scrum Master. I came to BizStream in August of 2015, and to be honest, I didn’t have much of a background in developing websites at that time. However, organizing, solving problems, and helping people figure out how to work together is my passion. I wear many hats as the Head of Operations, a Team Lead, and a Project Manager. Due to this, my primary role changes day-to-day.
One thing I have discovered since I have been here is that I also love finding great people to come work with us. Our people make up most of our great culture, so it is truly awesome sharing it with others and helping them see if they would be a good fit and know that they can contribute to our culture immediately. One thing I have found to be true since day one is that BizStream is the kind of company that I would have built given the opportunity. Everyone here is empowered to make a difference.
My background is actually in Communications. I graduated from GVSU with a film degree and spent the first several years of my career in the video production industry. It was there that I first learned about producing and project management and found I might have a knack for it. I’ve also found that working in the web world is not that different from the video world. I’ve been managing people since I was 18. I’ve had various managing positions since then, learning a lot as I go. I’ve found that managing people can be one of the most rewarding and most challenging parts of my job, but I wouldn’t change a thing.
When I’m not working, I love spending time with my wife, four kids, and dog. I absolutely love movies of all kinds. Blockbusters, foreign films, cult classics, etc. You name it; I’ll check it out. I also love cooking, backpacking, camping, and working out.

Working with BizStream has been a pleasure. Not only do they know the Kentico platform inside and out, but they also genuinely care about delivering the best solution possible. BizStream fully supported us through the early stages of the project, where we appreciated the detailed discovery sessions that BizStream led us through to get the requirements right. As the process continued and as our site was built, we liked their approach to sprint-based delivery and their ability to adapt to some of the last-minute details. That support was felt most as the final go-live of the site was met. Our stakeholders were extremely happy with the results. At each point, we felt we could count on BizStream, unlike other vendors we have encountered in the past.

I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
I joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn’t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.
That same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.
I went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).
I was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
We have a group of like-minded people here. There’s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I’m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it. When people think it can’t be done, we’ve done it.
I love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It’s what I’d do even if BizStream didn’t exist. What we do at BizStream isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s challenging, sure, but I couldn’t be in a job that wasn’t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.
It also makes me happy that we’ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the BizStream Academy — a program where we offer development training for students — and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.
I work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work, which is one of the great things about BizStream — the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I’m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.
When I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),  and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy. I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico’s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world. When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.
As a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don’t care that it’s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn’t realize it, but I was learning what “whatever it takes” really means.
I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I’ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I’m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I’ve never met a Roulette table I didn’t like.

Mark Schmidt
Our motto of whatever it takes starts at the top and goes all the way through the organization. And, we mean whatever it takes for our team, our clients, our community, anything we touch, really.
The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that’s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU’s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I’d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.
After GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.
With a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That’s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don’t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That’s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.
At BizStream, we’ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it’s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be cliché, but it’s true — we work hard and we play hard.
I’ve found that if you’re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people’s shoes, and I’m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don’t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don’t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren’t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.
The reason BizStream’s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn’t want to work at a typical job. That doesn’t mean I didn’t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let’s make it something we want to do.
This mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We’ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).
In addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College’s computer sciences department. It’s really cool because I’m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.
When I’m not working, I’m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I’m not at work, I’m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I’ve done a lot of home automation, and I’m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.
Work is such a big part of most everyone’s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.
There’s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” That’s where it’s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren’t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.

Cory VandenBout
In 2006, I came on at BizStream. I got an interview, was hired on as a junior developer, and over time made my way to the top as a senior developer and technical lead. I’ve been around long enough to really see the company change and grow.
Most of my life has been spent in the West Michigan area — Jenison, Allendale, Grand Rapids, and now Rockford, with a brief stint in Fort Lauderdale.
I graduated from Grand Valley State University in 2003, and went on to work at a mortgage company in IT for a year and a half. After a year and a half I was transferred down to the Fort Lauderdale branch. I stayed for more than a year, and it was definitely a great experience, but I eventually made my way back to Michigan.

BizStream isn’t a typical office. There’s no bureaucracy or red tape to get stuff done. If you have an idea, you can start and run with it. We’re pretty open to new things and to changing things for the better. No one here is stuck in their ways.
The atmosphere here is pretty laid back. Everyone’s great — we’re all friends. We’re all kind of similar in the way we think about work and life. Here, work isn’t the thing you have to go to every day; it’s a place you get to go to.
Traveling is something I’d like to do more. As a kid, my family traveled all over America. Later in life, I’ve gone to Jamaica, London, and honeymooned in Paris and Cannes, France. I would like to go back to London. I like the idea of being in a foreign country without a language barrier. You get to see a different culture, but don’t feel walled off from everyone. I also want to go to Hawaii, Italy, Iceland, and maybe the Netherlands would be cool too. Oh, and to New Zealand to see the Lord of the Rings sets.
Since I’ve been out in the real world, I’ve learned that patience with new technology is essential. That old Yoda quote inspires me to hang in there when I’m figuring out stuff: “Do or do not. There is no try.”

Part I: An Introduction to ASP.NET StatusCodePages
In almost every MVC site I’ve developed on the Kentico Xperience Platform, there has been one feature that has never quite felt “right”: Error Pages.
Whether it’s due to confusing configuration (looking at you, System.Web), awkward routing and redirects in controllers, or multiple, sometimes ambiguous, patterns for handling exceptions (looking at you again, System.Web), creating user-friendly error pages in Kentico Xperience MVC sites don’t always seem straight-forward.
It’s time for a reckoning.
In this 3-part series, we’ll be covering the background to BizStream’s xperience-status-code-pages packages, reviewing how the ASP.NET Core StatusCodePages pattern can be extended to serve user-friendly error pages from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree.
Within the ASP.NET Core framework, StatusCodePages is a pattern for providing a response body, based on the response’s status code.
The StatusCodePages pattern provides a variety of IApplicationBuilder extension methods that configure the behavior of the underlying middleware, and allow developers some options as to how the response should be handled. Of these extension methods, UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute is particularly attractive, as it allows developers to specify a path upon which to re-execute the request pipeline.
An advantage to “ReExecute” over “Redirect”, is that the original URL is preserved in the client. A request to /not-a-real-url that produces a 404: Not Found status code is returned to the requested URL, /not-a-real-url, rather than redirecting the client to /error?code=404. If you’re a veteran ASP.NET developer with IIS Rewrite Module experience: a “ReExecute” is similar to a “Rewrite”, as opposed to a “Redirect”
For Example:
An additional advantage to this pattern is that in other controllers, the base Controller.NotFound method can be used, as opposed to redirecting to a custom “NotFound” action:
The RedirectToAction( "NotFound", "Error" ) is a common pattern I often see in Kentico Xperience MVC sites, wherein the NotFound action queries the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for some type of NotFoundNode.
In many cases, we’d like to give Content Editors the ability to manage the content of Error Pages. This can be achieved by building upon the ErrorController from the previous example to query and serve content from the Kentico Xperience Content Tree:
That’s quite a bit of query logic in the controller…
We can clean that up by defining a service to compose the IPageRetriever usage and query logic. We’ll try to work with Kentico’s “Page Retrievers” pattern here by defining an IErrorPageRetriever that describes the retrieval of an HttpErrorNode:
Add our services to the IServiceCollection in the Startup, and the ErrorController is a bit more concise.
All of this is nice, except for one. little. thing. /error?code={0}. All of the error pages are accessed at the /error path with a query string, Yuck! An ideal solution would allow us to use Page Routing to give Content Editors the ability to configure the URLs of the error pages, just like any other node in the Content Tree. Page Routing would also give greater flexibility to support Redirect or ReExecute behaviors.
We are now presented with a new problem: UseStatusCodePagesWithReExecute and UseStatusCodePagesWithRedirects require a specific path string that must be known when Startup.Configure(IApplicationBuilder) is invoked and the UseStatusCodePages* method is called. In order to make Page Routing work, the StatusCodePages middleware requires a means of dynamically querying the Content Tree for the PageUrl of the expected HttpErrorNode in which the request should Redirect to or ReExecute.
Unfortunately, neither of the WithRedirects or WithReExecute extensions provide overloads that would allow dynamic retrieval of the path to Redirect to or ReExecute on. There is still hope, however, thanks to the UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func<StatusCodeContext,Task>) overload. This overload allows a Func<StatusCodeContext, Task> delegate to be passed, which effectively functions as a Request Delegate via the StatusCodeContext.
In Part II: Implementing Kentico Xperience StatusCodePages Middleware, we’ll explore how UseStatusCodePages(IApplicationBuilder, Func<StatusCodeContext,Task>) can be used to implement our own WithRedirects/WithReExecute extension methods that query the Kentico Xperience Content Tree for the PageUrl to Redirect to or ReExecute on, in a manner that is compatible with the behavior of the extensions provided by the framework.

Your First Day on the Job at BizStream
I don’t know about you but I have had some less than stellar first days on the job, where the day is full of paperwork and downtime sitting around waiting on managers or others to “get around to me.” It sort of makes sense right? You’re new, you don’t really understand the nuances of the company, your position, or even the technology you’re using. I wonder if it’s just a foregone conclusion that your day is just going to be that, paperwork and sitting around? But does it have to be that way?
I have also started my first day with less than stellar equipment, few or no accounts or nothing at all, just a blank desk. At some point in the day someone will walk by and say, “Oh I guess we need to get you some things.” I have been at companies that view this as some odd right of passage, or I am told, “it’s just the way it is.” Why is that? I am sure in most instances it was not intentional, but sometimes managers are just so relieved to find someone to fill the position they forget about how it feels to be the “n00b” on your first day. BizStream, being a small company, has run into some of these same challenges, so we started an “Onboarding” team to alleviate or lessen some of these issues and make the first day a better experience for everyone.
You only get one first day, you only get one first impression: why not make it as awesome as possible?
Just like the potential team member wants to make a good impression during their interview, wouldn’t you want to show off your best as a department, team, or company? After all, you spent a lot of time and effort to find that right person to help backfill, maintain, or take your company to the next level. Why would you want them to question if they made the right move?
When I started at BizStream I noticed that we were not consistent on how new team members were brought in. Now, to the leadership’s credit, I was greatly impressed that they had thought it out and had a roughed out task list. The issue was it was not formalized or inclusive enough to make things consistent even though it far exceeded some other companies I had worked for. I have had good success in previous roles with bringing people in, so I wrote up a quick one page outline and shared it with a few people internally. This led to a larger discussion and our Onboarding team was formed.
As a team we talked about what needed to happen, at minimum, on a team member’s first day. We talked about the good and bad of our first days at other companies and we developed what is now our standard Onboarding schedule.
Our team decided that we wanted, at minimum, the first day completely scheduled out for the new team member. Now, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t any downtime, but it is minimal. If you know BizStream, you know we are not into a formal, corporate, schedule your every waking moment kind of thing, but we made an exception here to help facilitate a lasting first impression.
We started by reviewing who needed to be involved in bringing on a new team member. Our current team looks like this: Office Manager, HR, Building Manager, Project Manager, IT. Each one of these team members has a vital role in “onboarding” a new team member. Each time we bring on a new team member we meet as a team with the hiring manager and someone from our Leadership Team to ensure that we understand all the expectations that were laid out during the hiring process, review any specific details, and set the schedule for the team member’s first day. This way everyone is on the same page and no one is blindsided on the day of. This is typically not a long meeting, typically only taking 30 minutes or less.
Overview: Below is a sample document that is printed out and left on the new team member’s desk as well as emailed to the hiring manager and the Onboarding team. This ensures that at any point during the day, anyone of these people can help the new team member through their day. The actual first day agenda document will have photos of the team members that the new hire is scheduled to meet with. I have found this to be exceptionally helpful as new team members are bombarded with data the whole day. It’s nice to be able to put a face with a name and if you need to find someone, to know what they look like.
First off, you will notice that we ask our new team member to start their first day at 9. You are asking yourself why do you give them a free hour on their first day? Typically most of our new team members start on a Monday. How many times have you walked into the office after a weekend and you have nothing but fires to put out? What if you were caught in traffic, or your kid spills milk all over you just as you’re about to leave? My experience is that new team members will try and show up early on their first day, now you as a manager, are already stressed due to the above or any other myriad of reasons. By having them start at 9 this helps not transfer that stress to the new team member and allows the manager to give them their full attention.
We will get into gear and accounts a little later, but with most people they like their desk a certain way, they like specific items on their desktop or want to import their browser favorites. This is a great time for them to do that and make their workspace their own and of course, to grab a cup of coffee.
We have a fantastic and unique office, and our team members really like it. We typically show people around when we interview, but we want the new team member to be familiar with where things are. They are going to be here eight or more hours a day, it’s nice not to have to hunt for things or ask every time, “where is that conference room?” Our office manager, Michelle, takes the new team member around and shows off our uniqueness, and the nuances of our office.
Every Monday we have a company meeting in which we discuss personal highlights in our “List of Awesome” as well as what business is upcoming for the week or month, what is new in the sales cycle, what things are being rolled out, marketing, events and a check-in to see if anyone has too much or not enough work. This is a great and relaxed time in which we all introduce ourselves to the new team member and where the new team member can get a 30,000 foot view of what our company is doing.
You can’t get around it, so it’s here. Amanda, our HR manager and Bookkeeper is great and keeps things as light and painless as filling out the handbook, insurance, and W4s can be!
What better way to bring on a new team member than to take them out to lunch on the company their first day? We are a team and a family at BizStream so we try and get to know our new team members on multiple levels. Lunch usually includes the hiring manager, one of both of the owners, and some or all of the team the new team member will be working with. Again, we are family so lunch includes lots of razzing and laughter about whatever is on our plates that week.
Our building manager also happens to be in charge of Quality Assurance (QA). Josh will review how to access the building, reemphasize where some key things are, and then discuss how our QA team handles projects.
That’s me, Blair. I like to discuss the software and hardware we use. Where to find things on our corporate file share, how to access our development servers, and how to access our VPN. This can sometimes get bogged down in a lot of technical stuff so I push to keep it light and short unless there are specific questions.
Mike, our Operations Lead, will take the new team member through our typical project process, walk them through our project management software, and show them how and where to track their work time. Every company does project management differently and each project manager leads projects a little differently. We find it helpful to be upfront as possible on how this works at BizStream in order to ease the new team member into our processes and reduce confusion.
We primarily use a Content Management System (CMS) named Kentico for most of the websites our team builds. BizStream has it’s own standards on how to implement Kentico and it’s code, so the rest of the day is dedicated to working through these standards and getting used to Kentico.
The Friday afternoon of the new team member’s first week we schedule a social hour. This is a time for everyone to grab a featured drink, chosen by the new team member, get to know the new team member, and relax as a team.
BizStream is obviously a tech company and we love our tech! As a new full time team member you get a laptop with the same specs as every other developer. You don’t get a hand me down because the IT guy wanted a new machine, you get a clean machine that is not more than a year old, and is packed with the same amount of power as anyone else in the company. We give you at least three 24″ screens connected to a dock, so taking your laptop to and from meetings is as painless as possible.
As a perk, you get to select the keyboard and mouse that you want to work with. It’s just another way that BizStream allows you to customize your workspace to fit your individual taste. The desk is full of BizStream goodies when you arrive. Our swag stock changes from time to time but a new team members can expect things like coffee mugs, travel mugs, sunglasses, pens, notepads, bottle openers and the like.
We strive to have all of the necessary accounts built for the new team member before they arrive. We use lots of software in our jobs, both in-house and in the cloud. I do my best to configure all those sign-ons to connect to one of two authentication platforms so when a new team member starts, they don’t have a sheet of 20 different passwords to commit to memory. If I did my job right, it’s one, sometimes two passwords, connected to a single sign-on (SSO) store.
We want to know what works, what didn’t, or what could be tweaked to make the experience for the next new team member that much better. About 30 days after the first day, we send out a quick survey that asks questions about your first day and first week on the job. We keep it short and light but we really do desire the feedback to make sure we are on the right track. The Onboarding team reviews each survey and makes improvements as necessary.
BizStream does not have all the right answers. Our team meets regularly to discuss what works what doesn’t. We have gone through several iterations to get the process to where it is now. Not all things described here will work for all companies, but I think it’s a good starting point to evaluate if you could be doing a better job as a team, department or company.
