Web Accessibility
Build a Website That’s Accessible for Everyone
Increase Engagement with All You Offer.
You know that web accessibility is important.
BizStream Can Help
Whether you’re starting a new site or redesigning your existing site, our comprehensive Web Accessibility Solution helps you deliver a positive experience to all visitors who interact with your organization.
In partnership with Recite Me—a leading global Enterprise SaaS accessibility solution provider—we’ll help you ensure your modern website reaches your entire audience.
What Does Web Accessibility Really Mean?
According to Census data, 27% of people in the U.S. have a disability that can make accessing online information difficult. For most organizations, that number alone makes improving web accessibility an imperative. A truly inclusive website provides an integrated approach that goes beyond basic and expected adaptations.
people in the U.S. live with a disability (CDC)
of U.S. residents are neurodiverse (CSR Wire)
Americans speak a language other than English at home (AMACAD)
Inclusive web development helps overcome barriers to access including:
Visual
Visual disabilities, including low vision, blindness, color blindness, or light sensitivity
Cognitive
Cognitive disabilities, which include a range of challenges including learning disabilities, neurodiversity, and behavioral and mental health disorders
Communication
Communication barriers, including language and cultural differences
Auditory
Auditory disabilities, including full or partial hearing loss and difficulty understanding sounds when there is background noise
Physical
Physical disabilities, such as muscular, sensory, joint, and pain disorders that limit movement and the ability to use devices
Speech
Speech disabilities, which make it difficult to use video chat, teleconferencing, or voice recognition technologies
Accessibility Isn't a Checkbox
For us, compliance standards are a baseline. But being inclusive means being in true partnership with your customers. It comes from a place of combined empathy and pragmatism. It’s being always open to the needs of others so you can deliver your solutions to everyone who wants them.

Build Your Accessibility Practice
Start now and enable continuous improvement with these essential elements for compliance and improvement.
Craft Your Accessibility Statement
Demonstrate Commitment to Inclusivity
Just as you include a Privacy Policy on your site, you should also include an Accessibility Statement. This simple document explains in plain language:
Explore free tools to generate your own Accessibility Statement.
Add An Accessibility Toolbar
Enable individuals to adapt your website to their needs.
An accessibility toolbar is an embedded widget that provides an array of controls so that site visitors can customize aspects of your site and launch adaptive tools. Some examples of adaptive controls include:
Set Up a Governance Solution
Follow through on your accessibility commitment.
Your accessibility practice is an ongoing process. Accessibility Checker software should give you a structure for active governance, including:
Build In Inclusivity
Accessibility presents unique challenges at multiple levels of your website modernization process.
Work with a partner who will guide you through the details every step of the way.
A Solid Foundation
Our Website Accelerator for Storyblok solution code has been checked, validated, and optimized to provide an accessibility-ready framework that enables best practices for your content and workflows.
Pre-Launch Screening
We’ll run a comprehensive site scan to identify any initial issues, recommend and implement remediation, and provide you with a baseline compliance score before your site goes live.
Post-Launch Support
As your web technology partner, we can provide screening, remediation, and consulting services as needed to support your robust website accessibility practice.
Digital Inclusion Is a Collaborative Journey
BizStream is proud to recommend the Recite Me platform as a comprehensive structure for your accessibility practice.

The Siteimprove for Kentico extension provides insights into:
Clients Using Siteimprove
I use the [Siteimprove for Kentico] Policy module to find the pages on our website containing contact information for employees who are no longer employed to delete these contact details. Our Danish website consists of approximately 4,500 pages, and our English website of approximately 700 pages. Because we have 850 employees in total, many employees leave every month. Without the Policy module, it would mean a lot of work to find every instance manually.

Our History
“BizStream” Launched
Well, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm&#8217;s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.
We Got Our First Big Break
Many may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.
We Launched Under the Name BizStream
As&nbsp;we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream!&nbsp;
Our First eCommerce Site Was Born
In 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn&#8217;t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting …
Visit the NoWaterBall site
We Moved Into Our First Office
To accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!
First GeekAid Music Festival Happened
The GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream’s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!
BizStream Moved
In 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!
Our First Product Made Its Debut
Remember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.
BizStream Became a Kentico Gold Partner
In 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!
Foosball Got Geeky
BizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn’t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they’ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.
BizStream University [Academy] Started
This program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to BizStream Academy and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
BizStream Bought a Building
In 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer’s loft with a firefighter’s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!
Mark Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal&#8217;s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream&#8217;s unique company structure.

BizStream Won Kentico Xperience Global Site of the Year
Our implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico’s 1,000+ global partners!
Over seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!
BizStream Won Michigan 50 Companies to Watch
In 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by&nbsp;Michigan Celebrates Small Business!
The theme for the year was &#8216;Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs&#8217; and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.
BizStream Became a Kontent.ai Partner
BizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico&#8217;s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai&nbsp;Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!
BizStream Named National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For
In 2018, we were recognized as a National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For® winner! We&#8217;ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!
Brian Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2019, it was Brian&#8217;s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.
Read the 40 Under 40 &#8211; Business Leaders &#8211; 2019 &#8211; Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
BizStream Expanded Our Office Space
With the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.
In 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!
BizStream Went Solar
In 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!
New Look and New Services
Now that we&#8217;re officially 21, we&#8217;ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We&#8217;ve come a long way over the years &#8211; from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services &#8211; whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
It&#8217;s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!
BizStream Receives Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni Award
In 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!
BizStream Expands Strategic and Digital Capabilities with Acquisition
In 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions—laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.

Core Values
For a more in-depth look at the meaning behind our core values check out our BizStream Is a Great Place to Work but It’s Not for Everyone blog post.
Atmosphere
BizStream’s office embodies our fun and unique culture. In our workspace, you’ll find a fire pole, slide, Foosball table, dartboard, arcade games, upbeat music, full kitchen, stocked mini-fridges, and coffee for days!
Education & Growth
We believe in celebrating wins and sharing knowledge. Each quarter, our team gathers for What We Crushed (WWC), where we highlight unique victories from client, internal, and community projects. Following WWC, we dive into Ology, a fun, themed experience centered around specific foods or drinks. From Cerealology to Fryology and Mixology, Ology offers a chance to connect, socialize, and creatively celebrate our shared achievements!
We also provide weekly catered Lunch n’ Learns, creating the perfect opportunity for team members to share knowledge and grow together. These sessions feature presentations on best practices, emerging trends, and innovative techniques. Occasionally, we bring in guest speakers to provide fresh perspectives and expertise, fostering continuous learning and inspiration within our team.
Flexible Work Schedule
BizStream offers Tuesdays and Thursdays as optional work-from-home days. We also offer flex-time, where you have flexibility in choosing your work hours. As long as you meet your weekly hours requirement, make sure our clients are taken care of, and get your work done, it’s all good.
The Tech
We want our team members to be efficient and comfortable as possible, that’s why we supply our development team with no less than 3 monitors and their preferred technology &#8211; is there a specific mouse or keyboard you favor? Prefer a laptop over a desktop? No worries, we’ve got you covered. BizStream also covers our team member’s phone plan.
Healthy Lifestyle
Let’s face it, developing isn’t the most active profession out there, but that’s a minor setback in our eyes. Work is important &#8211; but so is our team members’ health.
We provide CrossFit memberships, gym stipends, on-site showers, climbing wall, adjustable workstations, ergonomically correct Steelcase chairs, and daily group walkabouts outside the office when the weather is nice. We also offer fresh fruit and healthy snacks and beverages on the daily!
Lifestyle Benefits
There’s enough to worry about in life, so we encourage our team members to buy in bulk and let someone else prepare their taxes for them.
Team members enjoy a complimentary yearly Costco membership and free tax preparation from our trusted accountant.
Traditional Benefits
We all want to know that if anything bad were to happen, our loved ones would be well looked after, that’s why we offer a $250,000 life insurance policy. We pay for 100% of our team’s monthly health and dental premium and contribute to their HSA. Team members are also offered a match on 401K.
Paid Time Off
Enjoy twelve paid holidays and up to 20 paid days of personal time.
We’ll occasionally step away from the office and kick back and relax with our team members. March Madness parties, BizStream golf outings, and company picnics are just a few ways we like to rejuvenate. Explore more of our fun side on our Facebook page.

Challenges
Adaptability Built In
The award-winning Growers of XtremeAg were in high demand for events and speaking engagements. But they wanted to expand their reach and share more of their expertise. They realized that an online member community would be ideal, so they turned to BizStream to build a fully functional member platform—from the ground up.
However, almost immediately after that site launch, they realized that they’d chosen the wrong medium for their mobile audience. We helped the Growers make a hard shift, customizing their blog-centric membership site to enable video publishing at scale.
Since that launch, the XtremeAg Growers have proven to be highly capable content publishers, producing thousands of pieces of video content and expanding across media formats, including webinars and podcasts, as well as live events.
Now, they were set to launch a new TV series, adding yet another media channel. With a site already past its limits and an audience whose viewing habits turn on a dime, the XtremeAg team knew they needed another evolution.
They asked BizStream to re-imagine their site, empowering their teams with a more media-forward platform and empowering their users with more efficient navigation, more relevant search and content recommendations, and a better user experience.
The ultimate goal was to not just get more people to engage—but also keep them connected to content that would truly help them with their specific farming needs and challenges.
Requirements
Getting Viewers On a Roll
For XtremeAg’s Growers and partnering sponsors, member engagement means empowering viewers to consume not just the first video they came for but also the next video…and the next…and the next.
It needs to be bingeable. Like YouTube. Or Spotify.
It needs to be personally relevant, enabling visitors to easily:
It needs to be future-proof, to make immediate improvements and position them for ongoing evolution.

Solution
Modern Web Technology, Modern Experience
We recommended moving the member website to Storyblok, one of our top-pick headless content management systems.
When modernizing a website, transitioning from traditional to headless CMS is becoming a higher priority for member-based organizations like XtremeAg.
They needed a solution that would empower them to:
XtremeAg’s High-Volume Content Production
Exceptional Content and Site Management
Storyblok’s best-in-class Visual Editor, best practices configured by the BizStream dev team, dramatically improves the XtremeAg team’s content management experience with:
Seamless Data Integration for Search and Personalization
Storyblok easily enabled us to integrate the Algolia Recommends AI search tool into the site, feeding it live analytics data to inform the machine learning application and enable more meaningful content discovery:
Support for Best-of-Breed Tools and Best Practices
Storyblok flexibly accommodates both API integrations and custom feature builds, so our team was able to create an optimized video experience that mimics other, familiar media sites, including:
Process
Accelerating Website Modernization
Because we had built XtremeAg’s original site and have remained their hands-on technical partner, BizStream was already in a strong position to remove roadblocks and accelerate the new website.
First in Line for our Web Accelerator for Storyblok
XtremeAg’s team was one of the first of our clients to leverage our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—a complete starter site that with 90% of the components needed to build a website faster and maximize available resources. With much of the basic web development already in place, we were able to focus resources on more complex features that personalize, filter, and display their content in unique ways.
Wireframing
Starting with wireframes allowed us to work through potential changes in a cost-effective manner. We produced over 30 wires to document the change before moving to design.
Site UI and UX Design
Once new layouts were approved, we updated the site design to refresh the established brand and enable improved site navigation, quick links, content personalization, flexible headers, and more.
Partner Enhancements
As with other associations, XtremeAg greatly values their partner sponsorships. Our new design improves partner visibility and enhances member access to partner websites, videos, events, and products.
Meticulously Planned Migration
Because the XtremeAg site contains an enormous amount of structured content, it helped that we had already established strong tagging and taxonomy. With that in place, we were able to create a highly intuitive content structure for the site editors. During the content migration, we also pulled video transcripts and created strong metadata across the pages to make the content consumable for both viewers and search engines.

Site visitors now enjoy a truly mobile-first experience, with intuitive navigation, easy ways to find and interact with the content they want on any screen or device, and seamless crossover into the rest of the Crunchyroll ecosystem.
To ensure the experience is uninterrupted, the site is geo-adaptive to display content, searches, and RSS feeds in each users’ preferred language. And users can customize their experience further with the option to toggle between dark-mode and light-mode versions of the site.
In the midst of an enterprise-scale site redesign, Crunchyroll has made the most of their opportunity, establishing Crunchyroll News as the go-to source for anime news, exploration, and engagement.
BizStream has been able to do more for us in 2 months than our other partners were able to do in a year—and they’ve become a key strategic partner for our organization. Their pragmatic approach, responsiveness to our requests, and guidance on marketing strategy has made them an invaluable resource for Investments &amp; Wealth Institute.

Challenges
Poised for Dramatic Improvement
It’s not unusual for very large corporate enterprises to have multi-layered websites comprising hundreds—even thousands—of pages.
But media organizations—such as the hugely popular anime streaming site Crunchyroll—house hundreds of thousands of pages and articles. Crunchyroll News, which is just one facet of the organization’s digital presence, provides continuous news and insights to tens of millions of subscribers and freemium members.
The company was working on the release of new corporate branding and a full site redesign, which included integrating the Crunchyroll News site into their ecosystem of videos, manga, games, and merchandise.
Requirements
Migrating the more than 230,000 multimedia news articles—in nearly a dozen languages—was a monumental task that needed to be completed in tandem with their larger website redesign.
In addition, the migration was a unique opportunity to make dramatic improvements in user experience, organic traffic, engagement, and ultimately, subscriptions. The Crunchyroll team knew that the news site had been neglected, and they were ready to modernize it.
Requirements that were critical to the news site’s success included:
It was a tremendous chance to make a meaningful difference for both internal and external users.
Choosing the Right CMS Partner
Coordination and Project Management with Storyblok Experts
To ensure the news site migration met both their timeline and their requirements, Crunchyroll’s technical team decided to bring an outside developer team into the project to work alongside their in-house developers. But they didn’t want just any provider; they needed a fully dedicated dev team with specific knowledge of user experience (UX) design, information architecture design, and their chosen CMS: Storyblok.
As a certified Storyblok partner, BizStream was uniquely positioned to take on their migration, providing experienced Storyblok developers dedicated to completing the news site. And because we are a full-service agency, we also understand the importance of elevating UX design, SEO, and site usability along with tailored CMS configuration and deployment.
But for Crunchyroll, the deciding factor was discovering BizStream’s expertise in creating tailored CMS environments that empower content editors—now and over the long term.
Most developer teams have the ability to configure in-the-box features and enable basic functionality. But Crunchyroll’s news editorial team is an outside-the-box group. They have a large core team and hundreds of contributors publishing in nearly a dozen languages from countries around the world. Their Storyblok configuration needed to be highly adaptable—empowering editors to tell an endless variety of stories, using every kind of media—within an intuitive content structure and defined branding.
Because BizStream specializes in that kind of nuanced focus on content editor usability, we became Crunchyroll’s top choice.
Solution
A Flexible Framework
Storyblok Is a Natural Fit
Our experienced dev team provided recommendations to help Crunchyroll make the most of Storyblok’s features.
Enterprise-Level Project Management
BizStream’s team is adaptable to any project scope.
Before beginning our work with Crunchyroll, we put in place a project management structure that would enable true partnership with their internal team.
The sheer size of the full ecosystem migration demanded that effort be divided between our teams. However, that also meant that for the quarter-million-article News site that was our focus, we needed to establish an even greater level of oversight than in projects we manage independently.
We established shared communication channels, using their team’s familiar collaboration tools and systems.
To maintain momentum and stay aligned, we:
—all while executing all design and technical priorities.
Above and Beyond
With these available framework basics, we applied our experience over a phased process to creatively solve Crunchyroll’s complex requirements.
Phase 1: Content Audit and Modeling
To ensure that we’d start on firm footing, we performed a deep content audit. Because of the volume of content involved—and because the original site was not responsive—we knew moving text and images into Storyblok would not be straightforward.
We wrote custom tools for this audit, which informed our content modeling exercises.
Then, we created multiple content models, presenting each to the Crunchyroll team and refining each iteration to ensure the final model would provide the editing experience their teams required.
Phase 2: Wireframing and Design
Our UX design experts leveraged Crunchyroll’s brand design system and specifications to create a set of high-fidelity wireframes, a critical time- and cost-saving step for complex sites.
Multiple Variants
We created pixel-perfect responsive designs for mobile and desktop, with variants for light and dark modes.
ADA Compliance
We vetted a full range of ADA-compliant colors for their design system, ensuring both light and dark modes meet the AA standard of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Take a Closer Look
The News site supports content in 11 languages, including Arabic, which reads right-to-left. We created the completely flipped page design shown here to ensure RTL balance and readability.
Phase 3: Storyblok Implementation and Component Creation
As we moved into technical development, our team set up the Storyblok space for Crunchyroll News.
We applied the content structure, built a set of core pages for reuse across content categories, and created reusable block components to empower editors to customize new pages.
With these customized, composable components, Crunchyroll’s team can tell any kind of story, incorporating any kind of content—all within their approved publishing workflow and adhering to their brand guidelines.
Phase 4: Migration Scripting, Testing, Execution, and QA
In the final phase of technical development, we created a comprehensive migration script that handled the transposition of raw HTML-based posts into structured JSON.
This complex phase required:
Before attempting the full migration, we segmented a sample set of article pages and ran them through a complete testing process.
A detailed quality assurance check revealed any stray issues ahead of the full migration. From there, we ran the scripts on the live environment and coordinated with the internal development team so they could finish their work before launching the new website.

In the 15 years since their last brand and web refresh, the society has strengthened and expanded their global partnerships and built innumerable layers into their online presence. But for website users, it was increasingly difficult to navigate those layers and access the value that the society provides.
To address those pains—and elevate their organization as the global leader it truly is—ASNT had embarked on a bold digital transformation, updating or replacing major member-facing technologies and systems including their association management system (AMS), learning management system (LMS), marketing platform, publications hub, and member community platform.
At the heart of these systems are three core websites: ASNT.org, ASNT Certification Services, and ASNT Foundation—all inextricably linked across the experience with ASNT.
They leaned on our expertise and guidance to ensure the new sites delivered:

Transforming the Online Experience Across Three Dynamic Websites
Results
When The ASNT transitioned from a costly and fragile Sitecore website to a modern, flexible, and future-proofed Storyblok headless CMS solution—powered by our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—the impact was dramatic. By making the switch, ASNT significantly reduced costs while streamlining content operations and accelerating marketing efficiency. After a thorough analysis of their savings and performance improvements, it’s clear that this move delivered measurable ROI across multiple fronts. Here’s a closer look at the key results:
reduction in IT spend on web properties
savings on annual CMS licensing costs
growth in content operations (from 1 user to 14 users)
boost in marketing productivity for new campaigns
per year saved in fixed costs, covering project costs in ~5 years
BizStream&#8217;s guidance has been indispensable to ASNT as we modernize our website and technology systems. They have become a bridge between our teams, supporting our key stakeholders with specific expertise and resources. And they provide broad consulting across strategic needs, from IT systems to UX design to SEO. Their partnership has enabled us to consolidate our efforts into a coherent plan—and maintain momentum for our transformation.

Digital Transformation Reveals Valuable Opportunities
Over the course of its rich history, ASNT has become a treasure trove of not just standards and certification resources but also information, training, publications, industry leadership, advocacy, mentorship, and technological innovation.
And of course, all those interconnected parts have become more complex over time. Both site visitors and staff struggled with the complexity of finding information and completing tasks—especially because many tasks ranged across more than one online platform. The society, too, struggled with the cost and resource intensity of operating sites on three separate, expensive, and unwieldy platforms.
Thus, in addition to modernizing their overall brand and online presence, updating these essential sites provided opportunities for truly impactful improvements.
Simplicity is key
Optimize content structure
Increase visibility of member benefits
Clarify certifications processes
Improve user journeys
Discovery
Mapping the Journey to a Modern, User-Centric Digital Presence
ASNT had a lot of motivation to move their project forward and a lot of ambition about how they wanted to reposition their organization. However, they also knew they needed to validate the direction they were headed with their members and their internal stakeholders.
So before jumping into web site redesign and CMS replatforming, we led them through a comprehensive Website Discovery and Roadmap project. This project phase was enormously beneficial for corralling the complexity of ASNTs project. The process enabled us to:

Applying Insights to Deliver on Key Requirements
With the roadmap we completed in ASNT’s Discovery phase, we moved their triple-website-redesign project forward. Our experienced teams delivered leadership and clarity by centralizing project management for the creation of all three websites. By managing the projects in parallel, we were able to recommend effective content consolidation and a logical user journey while delivering efficiencies in integrations across sites and systems.
Brand modernization and refinement
For ASNT, modernizing their global online presence started with modernizing their brand—especially their logo, which had a distinctly dated look.
Dramatic UX and site design improvements
Returning to our site usability study, we applied UX best practices to help ASNT tell a more compelling story and reduce clicks and friction in the user journey. We developed:
User-centric content uplift
A primary requirement for all of ASNT’s sites was to align page content with user needs and tasks. Our account managers and content team did a deep dive into ASNT’s user personas. Then, we collaborated to:
In addition, we wrote new entry-point, informational, and interstitial pages to create a better user guidance and enhance SEO. These pages also modeled panel and page layouts to guide ASNT’s internal content team as they carried forward content changes on their extensive internal pages.
Best-practices-driven technical build
By using our Web Accelerator for Storyblok—which provided a solid framework and WCAG 2.2 accessibility for all the sites out of the box—we increased the speed of technical development, enabling simultaneous builds across three websites.
BizStream is more than a tech support provider for ASNT. From the selection of the Storyblok CMS to building the sites to establishing integrations with existing and new tools, BizStream is an active and supportive strategic partner.
With Storyblok best-practices in place, we are able to foster seamless integrations that enable ASNT to choose best-of-breed, modern technology solutions that provide the best possible ROI in a composable ecosystem.
A New Digital Era for ASNT
From complexity to clarity in a modern CMS
BizStream managed ASNT’s complex scope and project requirements, handing literally thousands of details over nearly 2 years of transformation.
With our experienced project and account managers at the helm, ASNT’s internal team kept their society humming. They relied on our dedicated in-house experts to provide leadership in everything from UX strategy to content development, design recommendations to training their CMS users.

Giving Members Value They Can’t Get Anywhere Else
For associations today, staying relevant is critical to their long-term sustainability.
For Investments &amp; Wealth Institute (IWI), reviving that relevance—and making their industry-leading certifications easy for new and existing members to embrace—had become a critical need.
Their old website had become overgrown, overblown, and overly difficult to navigate—for both site editors and site visitors. Existing and prospective members couldn’t easily find what they were looking for.

BizStream’s UI/UX designers and content strategists teamed to dramatically consolidate the volume of content that visitors must sift to find what they are looking for. Navigation is streamlined, key information is easy to digest, and common actions are easy to complete.
Connecting What You Want to What You Already Have
Storyblok enables fast, easy, API-based integrations with IWI’s existing tools and technologies. Without ripping and replacing systems that are essential to their operations—and leveraging BizStream’s comprehensive Web Accelerator components—they now have a seamless, intuitive experience. Members can get whatever they need, on desktop or mobile, and always feel like they are at home with IWI.
Process
Maintaining Modernization Momentum
Once we had completed IWI’s Website Discovery project, we had a clear roadmap for making sure their website rebuild stayed on focus, on track, and on budget. Our experienced account teams took a leadership role, directing the project, ensuring timely milestone completions, and guiding their teams through a phased process following a logical progression.
Site UI and UX Design
Before moving the visual elements into a design, our designers and account strategists produced a comprehensive set of wireframes, prototypes that enable us to map the user journey from top-level navigation through every interaction.
Renewing the Brand
BizStream’s creative team worked closely with their executive leaders to create a fresh visual design and messaging that faithfully represent the association’s mission, values, and position as an innovator in the financial services industry. Our teams translated their core concepts to create an instant, emotional connection and convey a member-centric view of the practical and long-term value of IWI’s certifications and membership.

With an approved sitemap and layouts, our design and content teams went to work producing high-resolution mockups and fully revised page content for more than 50 core site pages.
We also coached IWI’s editorial team, empowering them to carry forward the same brand and content changes on their extensive internal pages, leveraging our best-practices–configured components in Storyblok.

An Inflexible and Increasingly Costly Website
For many associations, website redesigns are deferred maintenance—always taking a back seat to projects that are more urgent, or easier, or cheaper.
The trouble is, the website is the front door for members. So when that entry point no longer works for you or your members, it’s time to make a change.
That was where Big I Illinois—previously Independent Insurance Agents of Illinois (IIA of IL)—found themselves. This professional association provides agencies and agents with industry resources, operations support, advocacy, and vital business connections.

Content management in the rigid and antiquated platform was limited to exactly two page-layout templates. Any changes to the site had to go through the external vendor’s ticket system, taking significant time and expense.
As the association approached its name change, the team wanted to give the site a new look. But more important, she wanted to take back control of her story and her marketing efforts.
The new site needed to:
Taking Back Control of the Story
Content Management
UX/IA

Solutions
Focusing on Empowerment
Because Big I Illinois’ most critical need was empowering their content editors, we recommended they build their new site in Storyblok. Although many headless CMSs offer benefits for modernizing website and technology architecture, Storyblok is the only CMS we found that is truly designed with content editors in mind—and at an affordable price point.
The Visual Editor ensures that both new and experienced business users can come up to speed quickly and feel comfortable utilizing the systems’ flexible features.
In addition, Storyblok will help Big I Illinois continue to adapt their site as needed with advantages such as:
True Content Control
Our teams leveraged our deep association experience to deliver association-specific components and features, including enhanced visibility into events, education, and resources.
Big I Illinois editors are no longer stuck with one way to present information. They can create, compose, change layouts, and re-imagine their story—all in Storyblok’s intuitive Visual Editor.
Intuitive & Personalized Navigation
The old site required numerous clicks just to find simple information. It was easy for users to get lost.
We helped the Big I Illinois team rethink their user journey and delivered changes to the site map, menus, and navigation. Now, users can see themselves in the association—and find personalized pathways to the information that’s truly relevant for them.
Simplified Search & Improved Access
For users needing to access member resources and benefits, we implemented a centralized Solution Center, adding SSO and Algolia search. Then, we pulled member content from the AMS into a user-friendly, interactive layout that reduces clicks and friction.
The new search functionality enables users to easily log in, search by topic or keyword, and filter results. And content editors can seamlessly add content and control its visibility to members and non-members.
Process
Discovery First: Re-imagining Possibilities
Being locked into a restrictive website doesn’t just impact how members see your association. It also limits innovation, creating patterns of thinking that prevent teams from imagining fresh approaches to their work.
For the Big I Illinois team, breaking those patterns was key to making meaningful changes in her site and her organization. BizStream’s experienced consultant team provided hands-on guidance, leading her through our defined process.
Website Discovery: Mapping the Project
For any size website project, from simple to complex, the discovery step is a time and cost saver. Through the Website Discovery and Roadmap phase of the project, Big I Illinois got a fresh understanding of the members who come to their site, what they need, and where they encounter roadblocks.
Our analyses and alignment discussions revealed insights that helped the team visualize a better user journey, brand new navigation, and significant opportunities to consolidate and simplify content.
Site UI and UX Design
Wireframing—high resolution layout prototypes—help save time and costs by enabling our UI/UX designers to develop modern page layouts before moving them into a visual design. These flexible frameworks facilitate productive discussions, helping Big I Illinois get an even clearer picture of the user journey, from top-level navigation through every interaction.
Visual Design to Smooth the Journey
Since Big I Illinois was implementing a brand uplift along with their name change, we created a visual design that leverages their professional color palette in a clean, modern page design.
Simple icons provide visual cues throughout the site to indicate links that go to external sites, video players, or downloadable resources. Details like these help visitors almost unconsciously understand where they are and how to take next steps.

For us, it was really important to go through the branding exercise to take some time and invest in that thought process of understanding who we were, how we wanted to present ourselves, what our voice was, and what our messaging was.

Data Is Beautiful
The InfinityQS visual brand serves to communicate the essence of what the company offers the world: data visualization that is masterful, powerful, helpful, and intelligent.
By using clean lines, friendly typography, bold colors, and patterns inspired by the movement of data, InfinityQS’s new brand shows the world that data is beautiful.
A crucial aspect of our marketing evolution was to fully articulate the unique value of our solutions. We needed to understand why customers should—and ideally would—buy from us rather than one of our competitors. Otherwise, how would we be able to help prospects come to that same conclusion? By centering on the customer in this way, we were able to focus our resources on reaching the right audience, improving the likelihood of successful conversions.

Challenge
Clearing Brand Creep
Fighting brand creep is an ongoing effort for many organizations. Over time, individuals and teams tinker with brand standards as they create content and ads; templates shift; colors morph; and your style inexplicably merges with your partners and vendors. The result is messy, blurry, indistinct branding that loses its punch.
When that happens, it’s time for a brand refresh. That’s where InfinityQS was at the start of a major product campaign: the launch of a new product-led sales model for their industry-leading manufacturing quality platform, Enact.
The product is an elegant solution that enables manufacturers to extract extraordinary value from their production data. But although Enact had evolved since its inception, its logo and primary look and feel had not been updated. And the company’s brand, overall, had experienced that slow creep.
InfinityQS needed a clear, unified message embodied in a clean, modern look to bring visibility and impact to their product relaunch.
Solution
Visuals That Speak Volumes
InfinityQS is in a unique position to support and accelerate the efforts of the people at the heart of manufacturing operations—and help them deliver positive business outcomes. Enact’s relaunch needed to clearly speak to those audiences, so we started by reviewing and updating their personas, as well as their product and company messaging.
Those foundational messages acted as an emotional and tonal guide for the development of a complete uplift of InfinityQS’s visual brand. Starting with the existing brand’s primary colors, our design team created a modern look and feel that still retains the authority of the industry-leading brand.

The site offers improved support for the internal sales team’s onboarding efforts, giving them more consumable content for prospects and customers to learn about the program’s value.

Simplifying the Message
While the START program offers significant value, its communication needed to be articulated in more concise, simplified terms for target audiences. Additionally, the START team required a more intuitive content management experience for collaborators around the globe to administer content. With these needs in mind, program stakeholders approached BizStream to re-launch the START website.
Solution
A Phased Solution
BizStream listened to the needs of the START team and mapped out a phased solution for the new website. The planning stage included a site functionality needs assessment, which informed the sitemap, content strategy, and UX requirements. In this phase, we identified Storyblok, a headless content management system (CMS), to provide a user-friendly content editing experience. In the design and creative support stage, BizStream utilized Storyblok to create efficient customer digital journeys focused on the target audiences’ unique needs.
We developed the site navigation, taxonomy, interfaces, and primary site content to be uncomplicated, while still providing pathways for long-form content to be readily accessible for site users. Last, we entered the technical development stage, which included CMS setup and configuration, creating site pages, and significant testing. BizStream collaborated with START to design various custom widgets for streamlined content creation moving forward, including content, video, and image modals within the Storyblok framework.

Challenge
Buried Potential
Rio Tinto’s U.S. Borax division produces nearly a third of the world’s supply of refined boron—an essential nutrient for healthy, abundant crops. With a global presence and decades of scientific research and educational information, the company is committed to helping agronomists and growers feed the world’s population. But to do so, it needed a more compelling, intuitive online presence. The division’s existing site lacked rich storytelling and buried its most useful information in static PDF files. The site also did little to promote customer communication or brand awareness.
Solution
Refined Storytelling
To educate visitors about the value and cost-effectiveness of refined borate supplementation, we created infographics that illustrate the refinement process and video storytelling to aid information retention. An interactive crop guide moves vital content out of static PDFs, making it easier to search and use. And a new ROI calculator helps consumers immediately relate real value to U.S. Borax Agricultural products.
Through regional content and success stories, consumers around the globe can quickly find information that relates specifically to their needs and can more easily contact local distributors and experts.

Challenges
Escalating Complexity
Automox&#8217;s SaaS model depends on empowering enterprise IT teams to self-discover, self-start, and self-educate. To that end, Automox provides substantive support, a user community, e-learning, and a rich resource center. All these pieces had been built over time around their monolithic website. However, without a central CMS, management of all those elements—in multiple platforms—had become problematic.
Managing content resources was the biggest source of pain for their teams. Blogs were housed in Ghost, downloadable assets and their landing pages in Marketo, and news and events were manually managed in a separate workflow, making searchability across topics impossible for site users. When they needed to add new downloadable content, the marketing team was hamstrung by a tedious process that required creating site references, building landing pages, and uploading assets in multiple places. And business users could not make any site changes—every page change had to go through the tech team.
In addition, as their brand visibility grew, they needed a news and press center—but none of their existing platforms provided a satisfactory way to add that new content to their site. Automox needed a better solution but couldn’t see a way forward that didn’t involve scrapping and rebuilding their entire site—and that was not an option.
Solution
Eliminating Content Silos
BizStream helped Automox centralize its critical blog and resource content in Storyblok, leveraging enterprise-ready capabilities to dramatically improve the user experience for site visitors and business users alike.
We migrated their blog and resource content; designed a highly flexible content model; and provided an enhanced user experience with improved asset display, navigation, and topical categorization. In addition, BizStream added a new press center, which includes a headline feed, featured news items, and press kit materials.
Enabling direct content management under a centralized architecture was essential for Automox’s marketing team. Our developers designed a flexible and intuitive content model that is intentionally adaptable as content needs scale.
The Storyblok Visual Editor provides a transformational improvement for business users. Marketers now have the power to make their own content changes and updates—quickly and easily—and see those changes as they make them. They can customize robust content experiences for specific high-value content, all while still allowing users to request PDF versions of the content in exchange for their contact information through integrated Marketo forms.

Challenges
A Timeworn Website
For over 50 years, the Petersen Asphalt Research Conference (PARC) has been bringing together top researchers, highway officials, suppliers, producers, and other industry top minds who are working to advance the specification and performance of asphalt and bitumen.
As with many time-honored fellowships, PARC’s existing website was beginning to show its age. Though functional, the site left much to be desired in readability, speed, and back-end efficiency. Core activities like abstract submissions, sponsorship coordination, and event registration were cumbersome for conference administrators.
Solutions
The Repaving Project
Like a potholed county road in need of repaving, the PARC website was ready for modernization. The conference coordinators leaned on BizStream&#8217;s expertise in recommending the right technology solutions for their express needs. The natural choice was Storyblok, a headless content management system with a flexible and intuitive platform. As a Storyblok certified partner, we configured the new ecommerce site to streamline previous inefficiencies and integrate with Stripe, their payment processing solution.

Trustmark needed to consolidate its existing business unit websites into one central, dynamic site.

Trustmark&#8217;s goal was to ensure that the next iteration of the One Brand site provided consistent branding across all of its business units.

While Trustmark had partnered with Bizstream on several Kentico projects in the past, this was by far the largest and most complex one to date. BizStream was able to translate the function and design requirements into manageable agile development sprints. The Trustmark Marketing and Web Development teams worked closely with the Bizstream team to refine the requirements and update components when needed. The modular nature of Kentico Page Builder allowed us to roll out features in sprints that enabled our internal stakeholders to develop content quickly and see immediate results. Instead of being overwhelmed, our internal stakeholders were able to meet the milestones more easily. BizStream Kentico specialization made it possible to Trustmark to launch our new One Brand consolidated website on time.

BizStream specializes in Kentico, and that&#8217;s evident in their depth of knowledge and familiarity with the product. I felt confident that they were up to speed on the latest version of Kentico and would develop my project in a timely manner. From a purely content management system perspective, Kentico has a lot of strengths. While my project doesn&#8217;t leverage all the great features, we were able to add functionality easily without a long development process and will continue to do so as our business requirements change. I would have no hesitation in recommending Kentico for CMS projects.

Results
Outcomes of the LMC.net project have been highly positive, garnering enthusiasm from both LMC staff and the Dealer Network. The new platform enables Dealers to access the site and LMC services seamlessly on mobile devices, a capability previously unavailable. The overall site speed and performance have seen a significant boost, particularly benefiting Dealers outside the US East Coast.
Increase in Active Dealer Logins
After having Kentico perform some work for us, we asked them to recommend a partner with which to continue working on our site. Kentico recommended three companies. Through the interview process, I got the best feeling about BizStream. It turned out to be the right choice for us.
We are extremely pleased with the outcome of the project. BizStream&#8217;s work is impressive, especially knowing how challenging it can be to work with someone else&#8217;s existing code. BizStream ‘went above and beyond,’ delivering something to the end user.
I would definitely encourage others to go with BizStream for development work, especially Kentico development. I was super impressed with how knowledgeable Brian [McKeiver] is and how closely BizStream works with Kentico. BizStream support was also top notch. Brian was very responsive, as was the support team.

Results
In late May 2020, a health and welfare consultant based in West Michigan engaged BizStream to develop a customized COVID-19 symptom tracker catering to the specific needs of employers. The consultant sought an affordable solution for their clients, offering a unique symptom-tracking system tailored to each client&#8217;s business. The primary requirements included the ability to monitor and generate reports on employees, notify managers/supervisors of symptomatic cases, and seamlessly integrate with their HRIS for comprehensive data tracking and compliance.
Despite free tools in the region, such as Spectrum Health&#8217;s COVID-19 tracking application, these options lacked the capability for employers to retain reported information. Additionally, many free tools had service gaps, rendering them incomplete solutions.
BizStream has been great—they are not looking to drive margin on the product; they are doing this as a community service.

Fulfilling a Need
Over a decade ago, American truck manufacturer Freightliner Trucks partnered with the financial and business consultant firm ATBS to create a website, Team Run Smart, that serves professional truck drivers across North America. To help truckers successfully operate a small business while maximizing drive time, the site enables members to share business, maintenance, and lifestyle advice for every stage of the trucking career path. The site was a massive success, but by 2019, Team Run Smart’s popularity had become a double-edged sword.
As its content library continued to grow, users found themselves increasingly frustrated by the site’s limited search functionality. The site’s navigation couldn’t keep up with its many blog posts and videos. And modern industry changes and challenges put truck drivers early on in their careers at a significant disadvantage—a topic absent from the site. For help, Freightliner turned to the site’s original strategy, design, and technical development team, now at BizStream.

Growing Pains
To address usability challenges and better serve both new and returning visitors, the team implemented a range of strategic content and navigation enhancements. These solutions were designed to improve engagement, strengthen community ties, and attract a broader audience.

Guiding the Buyer Journey
In the association management software (AMS) space, two leaders stand out: Protech and Fonteva. Both companies have developed association-tailored, all-in-one platform solutions—based in Microsoft 365 and Salesforce, respectively—to help associations run complex operations effectively and efficiently.
Now, under the collective Togetherwork brand, the two organizations find themselves in a collaborative (rather than competitive) sales space. BizStream had worked with both Protech and Fonteva on previous projects, and Togetherwork turned to us again to build a new, shared, lead-generation website.
This new site would capture potential customers high in the sales funnel and guide them to the solution that is most aligned with their unique needs.
Solution
Aiming for Conversion
Our website content and design process begins with a deep understanding of the target audience. To bring together the Protech and Fonteva worlds, we worked closely with SMEs from both companies to understand the information needs and decision drivers for association software teams who are seeking a new AMS. Then, we learned what those buyers would need to change their thinking—and embrace the idea of a full platform solution.
Our discovery and strategic planning were supplemented by revisiting existing Protech and Fonteva websites, resource centers, and brand assets. A substantial body of information already existed, and we aimed to complement those websites and resources, not replace them.
We focused on crafting a signature website that stands on its own to provide lead generation through:
As content development progressed, we selected a WordPress template and began creating the site architecture while our visual designer created the overarching look and feel for the site, its design, and aesthetics.
As part of the WordPress build, we strategically developed aspects that enable site adaptability. We ensured that the Togetherwork team can easily add content pillars and resource center assets to continue to reach their target audience.

And the new product-led process was empowering customers by removing the risk and roadblocks involved in trying new software.
And, because product-led doesn’t mean hands-off, we put in place key metrics to enable ongoing monitoring of user signups, activation, and retention. A product-led approach isn’t right for every organization, but for InfinityQS, it was a logical next step in their product evolution.

InfinityQS, a market leader in quality software for manufacturing, has always used a traditional, high-touch, consultative sales model. However, as they matured their cloud-based quality platform, Enact, they saw an opportunity to enable a new journey—one that puts customers in the driver’s seat and empowers them to gain meaningful value from the software faster.
A product-led, SaaS-based sales model would eliminate friction and risk, giving prospective customers:
To make the pivot happen within their incredibly tight timeframe—just three months from start to launch—InfinityQS turned to BizStream, a trusted partner who could drive momentum across all the moving parts and keep them on track to meet their incredibly tight timeframe.
Solution
Parallel Production Paths
Whether you’re pivoting from an existing sales model or launching a brand-new SaaS product, it’s critical to understand the end-to-end process that will keep you on track and help ensure a successful launch. As a full-service agency, BizStream has established processes that enable us to simultaneously manage multiple project elements.
InfinityQS realized they&#8217;d need to overhaul their entire customer startup experience—from messaging, website content, and SEO strategy to pricing, purchase, onboarding, and expansion pathways. And they’d need to re-imagine their internal and external processes along the way.
Coordinating our technical, content, marketing, and design teams with InfinityQS’s internal teams, we anchored the project by focusing first on essential, foundational elements: new company and product messaging, customer journey mapping, user experience design, and technology selection. With those elements in place, we could put teams to work blocking and tackling the website changes, microsite build, ecommerce integration, and site content revision and optimization.
Aligning Technology, Content, and Campaigns
Our technical experts leveraged existing knowledge to recommended technologies that would be cost- and time-effective to enable critical infrastructure. NetSuite enabled us to leverage InfinityQS’s legacy customer database while sharing key customer attributes with other systems. We paired Storyblok and Netlify to flexibly enable content management and hosting for the Enact Guided Learning microsite. User List provided the means to push nurtures, reminders, and prompts to new users, and User Pilot enabled an in-app messaging service for active Enact users.
At the same time, content marketing and design teams developed digital and social ad campaigns, built landing pages, rewrote site content, and created nurtures to ensure a connected user experience from first touch to conversion to onboarding.

Working with BizStream has been a pleasure. Not only do they know the Kentico platform inside and out, but they also genuinely care about delivering the best solution possible. BizStream fully supported us through the early stages of the project, where we appreciated the detailed discovery sessions that BizStream led us through to get the requirements right. As the process continued and as our site was built, we liked their approach to sprint-based delivery and their ability to adapt to some of the last-minute details. That support was felt most as the final go-live of the site was met. Our stakeholders were extremely happy with the results. At each point, we felt we could count on BizStream, unlike other vendors we have encountered in the past.

Challenge
Reconnecting with Members
One of the largest student-governed organizations in the world, the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), has empowered students and leaders in engineering and STEM fields with access to academics, peer support, and innovation since 1975.
As they approach their 50-year anniversary, NSBE has put in place a strategic plan for its ongoing evolution. A significant part of that strategy involves transforming their online presence to better serve their members and extended communities.
NSBE’s executive team recognized that to reach their strategic goals and get meaningful value from the changes they would make, they needed to start with a deeper understanding of the people at the heart of their service.
They turned to BizStream for a research project that would bring their membership a clear voice in the evolution of the society and guide future marketing and website changes.
Solution
Phased Research Methodology
BizStream designed an interview-centered research project to reach all of NSBE’s major stakeholder audiences and document key aspects of their relationship with the organization.
We structured the project around a phased process that would enable us to connect with a wide sample of stakeholders across multiple segments of the organization.
Our team worked closely with NSBE’s executive team to identify six member and influencer personas, then developed detailed questions for each persona segment.
NSBE provided contact lists and sent email outreach, and our team leveraged an online scheduling tool to automate interview setup. Over the course of 6 weeks, we conducted nearly 60 recorded interviews, and documented and analyzed interview and survey responses.
With an enormous amount of information in hand, our team set to work sifting and consolidating responses, taking care to include a full range of feedback and preserving interviewee voices in both summary statements and direct quotes.
For projects such as this one—designed to integrate with and inform further efforts—delivery never means “handoff.” We took the time to present our findings to NSBE’s team, provide context, and include recommendations for making the most of this valuable information.

BizStream Gains Kontent.ai Partner Content Modeling Competency
We are happy to announce that BizStream, a Kontent.ai Premium Partner, has gained the newly released Kontent.ai Content Modeling Competency. The Content Modeling certification acknowledges BizStream as qualified in delivering high-quality, future-proof projects with excellent user experience.
Importance of Content Modeling
Content modeling aims to create a content model, which is a framework for your content to make sure it’s highly reusable, presentation independent, and supports all aspects of your business and your clients’ needs. In essence, content modeling structures your content into highly reusable pieces and adds relationships and meaningful metadata to support omnichannel delivery.
From the Kontent.ai team’s experience, well-modeled projects are more successful from both result and satisfaction points of view. For us, content modeling is one of the most important things that can decide the success of your project.
Content Modeling Competency
To earn the Content Modeling Competency, Kontent.ai partners must prove they can:
A minimum of two people from the agency must go through the workshop – one business person and one technical person.
One of the reasons that the team here really enjoys working with Kontent.ai as a Headless CMS is its robust content modeling capabilities. Having a strongly structured, simple, and reusable content model is the most critical component of delivering a successful digital property/website. Gaining this competency from Kontent.ai validates that our team is experienced in content modeling and can deliver on the promise that Headless CMS brings to our clients. I am proud to receive this recognition and further our abilities as Kontent.ai Premium Partners at BizStream.

BizStream&#8217;s Journey to Embracing DEI
Understanding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
In today&#8217;s dynamic world, acknowledging the depth that diversity contributes is essential. Each individual&#8217;s perspectives, molded by their life experiences, intricately weave into the vibrant fabric of our society, prompting a recognition of humanity&#8217;s multifaceted nature.
However, diversity alone doesn&#8217;t suffice; equity and inclusion stand equally crucial. Equity addresses historical inequalities and systemic biases, ensuring impartial access to opportunities, while inclusion actively values and integrates diverse voices, nurturing a sense of belonging and inspiring innovation.
Recognizing that diversity, equity, and inclusion extend beyond racial boundaries is also key. These principles collectively strive to dismantle barriers across intersecting identities, encompassing gender equality, diverse sexual orientations, accessible opportunities for individuals with disabilities, respect for varying cultural and religious practices, and alleviating socioeconomic disparities. Through promoting equity and cultivating genuine inclusion, we lay the foundation for a culture characterized by harmony and progress.
Fostering a Culture of Open Dialogue
Achieving the intertwined objectives of diversity, equity, and inclusion involves cultivating an environment that encourages open dialogue and embraces differing viewpoints. This ongoing journey entails inviting diverse perspectives and acknowledging dissenting ideas, fostering true inclusion that actively engages with mixed thoughts.
BizStream&#8217;s transformative journey towards DEI is rooted in a commitment to educate ourselves about the profound impact of diversity, equity, and inclusion on our team members and the organizational landscape. This educational pursuit transcends surface intentions and delves into understanding the fundamental principles that underpin these concepts, acknowledging their potential to shape a more inclusive and equitable future.
Establishing the BizStream DEI Committee
A pivotal stride was taken in 2022 when BizStream established its DEI committee. The committee&#8217;s mission and purpose are defined in our DEI Committee Charter as:
Mission
The BizStream Committee for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) will serve as a force for good within the company, within our local communities, and within the technology industry.
Purpose
The DEI Committee exists to:
Commitment to DEI Education
One responsibility of our DEI committee is to identify and coordinate educational opportunities, workshops, and training programs to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion awareness among employees.
One pivotal contributor to our journey has been Sandy Harvey, MBA, CDP, of Exodus Consulting. Sandy played a central role in guiding us through the intricacies of DEI through her Diversity Awareness and Unconscious Bias workshops.
Diversity Awareness Workshop
This interactive and reflective course led us to explore the multifaceted characteristics we all share beyond race and gender. It highlighted how diversity awareness has evolved from eliminating discrimination to promoting active inclusion. Through these sessions, we&#8217;ve understood that the more aware we are of these nuances, the better we can foster meaningful relationships.
Unconscious Bias Workshop
Delving into the depths of unconscious or implicit biases, this workshop exposed the fact that everyone possesses such biases. The workshop showcased how these biases also manifest in our professional environments, potentially leading to unhealthy behaviors and exposing organizations to discrimination and harassment risks if unchecked.
Words Have Weight Workshop
Another contributor was Jessica Bacon, CRCR, who presented on weight biases in the workplace.
This workshop casts a spotlight on the influence of body size on workplace inclusivity. The discussion centered around the impact of body size discrimination, its potential implications for BizStream, and the significance of addressing this issue.
These workshops are pivotal milestones in BizStream&#8217;s ongoing journey towards creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace, embodying our commitment to continual growth and positive transformation.
Internal and External Initiatives
Incorporating pronouns in communications, email signatures, Slack profiles, and team member profiles on our website goes beyond mere adjustments; it&#8217;s a meaningful step towards representation and respect for each individual&#8217;s gender identity. This practice fosters a welcoming environment and acknowledges the importance of recognizing and validating diverse identities within our team.
Beyond BizStream&#8217;s internal initiatives, we actively engage with and support local endeavors. This includes our partnerships like Change the Code, a student-led non-profit organization aimed at improving gender balance within the STEM industry, and our participation in Holland Pride, a pivotal event organized by Out on the Lakeshore. By participating in these events, celebrating women in STEM and the LGBTQ+ community, we manifest our unwavering commitment to catalyzing broader societal changes.
Additional DEI efforts include commemorating Juneteenth as a company holiday, accompanied by educational initiatives, recognizing and celebrating the significance of Pride Month, and participating in International Day of Pink, a worldwide anti-bullying and anti-homophobia event. We hope these actions convey our unwavering determination to cultivate an inclusive workplace that genuinely embraces the diverse backgrounds and identities of all team members and their diverse family members.
Final Thoughts
Embracing DEI isn&#8217;t just a checkbox for us; it&#8217;s a mindset that influences every facet of our company culture. We cherish each individual&#8217;s unique perspective and are committed to treating everyone with the same compassion and respect we expect for ourselves. By creating an equitable and inclusive workspace, we strive to foster an environment where every individual can flourish.
The journey isn&#8217;t a one-time achievement; it&#8217;s an ongoing commitment to fostering diversity, inclusivity, equity, and respect. We&#8217;re dedicated to learning, growing, and continuously improving as we work towards creating a more just and harmonious world for everyone.

Our History
“BizStream” Launched
Well, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm&#8217;s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.
We Got Our First Big Break
Many may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.
We Launched Under the Name BizStream
As&nbsp;we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream!&nbsp;
Our First eCommerce Site Was Born
In 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn&#8217;t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting …

We Moved Into Our First Office
To accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!
First GeekAid Music Festival Happened
The GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream’s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!
BizStream Moved
In 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!
Our First Product Made Its Debut
Remember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.
BizStream Became a Kentico Gold Partner
In 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!
Foosball Got Geeky
BizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn’t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they’ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.
BizStream University [Academy] Started
This program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to BizStream Academy and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
BizStream Bought a Building
In 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer’s loft with a firefighter’s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!
Mark Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal&#8217;s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream&#8217;s unique company structure.

BizStream Won Kentico Xperience Global Site of the Year
Our implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico’s 1,000+ global partners!
Over seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!
BizStream Won Michigan 50 Companies to Watch
In 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by&nbsp;Michigan Celebrates Small Business!
The theme for the year was &#8216;Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs&#8217; and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.
BizStream Became a Kontent.ai Partner
BizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico&#8217;s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai&nbsp;Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!
BizStream Named National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For
In 2018, we were recognized as a National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For® winner! We&#8217;ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!
Brian Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2019, it was Brian&#8217;s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.
Read the 40 Under 40 &#8211; Business Leaders &#8211; 2019 &#8211; Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
BizStream Expanded Our Office Space
With the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.
In 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!
BizStream Went Solar
In 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!
New Look and New Services
Now that we&#8217;re officially 21, we&#8217;ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We&#8217;ve come a long way over the years &#8211; from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services &#8211; whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
It&#8217;s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!
BizStream Receives Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni Award
In 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!
BizStream Expands Strategic and Digital Capabilities with Acquisition
In 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions—laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.

Skillset
The first time I had access to the backend of a website was when I was working at Grand Valley State University. I guess that’s how it all started for me. The code on GVSU’s site was broken, and the guy who wrote the code left. I told everyone I could fix it, even though I’d never done anything like that before. I figured it out. I fixed it. That experience made me realize that helping people with technology is something I like doing.
After GVSU, I worked for big companies and small companies, and I learned some things. People are the strongest asset, not the products. When I started BizStream, I wanted to get together a group of the right people. A team that would do a great job of making clients happy.
With a background in intranets, I knew having a central location for organizations to access all kinds of company data is pretty smart. That’s why we created the BizStream portal. We found our niche in case and court management. Clients don’t need the hassle or expense of maintaining expensive systems. That’s how BizStream really got off the ground. Website development came later.
At BizStream, we’ve really worked hard at creating a certain kind of culture because it’s key to the keeping the team happy and to keeping clients happy. We keep it solid. We have a good, fun, open environment. It might be cliché, but it’s true — we work hard and we play hard.
I’ve found that if you’re going to provide good, decent services, you have to value people. I think I have a good ability to put myself in other people’s shoes, and I’m not sure everyone can do that. At BizStream, we don’t look at just a project, we look at the people, the client. And, you have to communicate. If you don’t inform and talk to people, solving problems becomes harder, outcomes aren’t as good. Good communication is essential to good relationships. BizStream could be a landscaping company, and it would still be all about the people.
The reason BizStream’s culture is the way it is, is because from the very beginning, I didn’t want to work at a typical job. That doesn’t mean I didn’t want to work ridiculously hard. I just realized early on that the majority of our lives are spent at work. So why make it something you have to do to? Let’s make it something we want to do.
This mindset applies to our clients, too. Why work with a typical software vendor because you have to? You know, a vendor that has terrible support, strict billing, or bad communication. We’ve all heard the horror stories of dealing with software customer support. I wanted to make a business where clients really enjoy working with us, and where they enjoy calling support (yes, it is possible).
In addition to programming and handling things at BizStream, I sit on the advisory board for Baker College’s computer sciences department. It’s really cool because I’m get to advise the college on what technology students really need to learn. I also sit on the board for Juvenile Justice Vision 20/20, which is working to re-vamp juvenile data for the state of Michigan.
When I’m not working, I’m hanging out with my wife and three daughters. We dig science museums. Even when I’m not at work, I’m programming, playing with micro controllers, mixing software with hardware. I really like playing with smart things. I’ve done a lot of home automation, and I’m doing it at the office, now, too. I keep pretty busy being the Allendale wrestling coach. I work out, and keep the BizStream team motivated to be healthy, too.
Work is such a big part of most everyone’s lives. You spend the majority of your time at work. For me, BizStream is a way of life. My wife works here, and my kids are in and out of the office. I love it when we have visitors. Anyone who wants to come out here, crack open their lap tops and learn about and web and software development, and take in the culture is totally welcome.
There’s this one quote from Confucius that sums up how I feel about BizStream: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” That’s where it’s at for me. Not only do I want to have a job I love, I want everyone who works at BizStream to have a job they love. If you aren’t happy at your job, it seeps into other parts of your life and affects people around you. I really want to be happy, and BizStream helps me be that.

Skillset
I joined BizStream on May 5, 2002. I remember the exact day because it was right after I graduated from Grand Valley State University. I had been promised a position with a large West Michigan employer, and for one reason or another it just didn’t work out, and next thing I knew I was looking for my next opportunity.
That same day, I met Mark, who I knew from my college days, for lunch. It was just happenstance we had lunch the same day I was suddenly without a job. He offered me a position on the spot.
I went back to the office with Mark after lunch and he showed me the product he was building. The technology was really advanced at that time. I knew right away this was the place I wanted to be. It was the second-best decision I have ever made in my life (sorry Mark, but the best decision still is the day I decided to take my wife out on our first date).
I was really attracted to BizStream because of the vision and possibilities Mark had for this new start-up company. I believed in BizStream so much that after 3 and a half years I became a co-owner.
I like that BizStream is purely powered by its employees. Every minute of every day that we put into BizStream is a direct correlation to the amount of success BizStream has.
We have a group of like-minded people here. There’s a great spirit of camaraderie. The passion for what we do shows in each team member. I’m confident that with our team, no matter what the product or project is, we can do it. When people think it can&#8217;t be done, we’ve done it.
I love my work, especially the problem-solving. I like saving companies time and money. And, I like to build web apps. It’s what I’d do even if BizStream didn’t exist. What we do at BizStream isn’t easy, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s challenging, sure, but I couldn’t be in a job that wasn&#8217;t. In addition to development, I do project management, operations, mentoring, sales, and marketing.
It also makes me happy that we’ve put our feet down here in Allendale, and that we give back to the community with things such as the BizStream Academy — a program where we offer development training for students — and by supporting community events and non-profit agencies.
I work a lot because I love it, but I do have a life outside of work, which is one of the great things about BizStream — the work/life balance. Outside of work, I hang out with my wife and 3 girls. I&#8217;m no stranger to Barbie and pink princess stuff. Watching them grow has been incredibly rewarding.
When I was in high school, I was the Grand Rapids City League champion of cross country (distance running),  and at GVSU, I was the president of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Now, I still love to watch sports, play video games, and golf when I can. Finding a nicely crafted beer is also on the top of my list of things I enjoy. I spend a lot of time writing tips and tricks about Kentico&#8217;s platforms, Kentico Xperience and Kontent.ai, on my blog at www.mcbeev.com. In 2012, Kentico recognized me as one of the few Kentico MVPs in the world. When I have a rare few minutes of downtime, I dive into reading about and exploring new technology.
As a kid, I delivered newspapers, which taught me a lot about getting things done no matter what. People don&#8217;t care that it&#8217;s raining or snowing; they want their newspapers. I owe a lot to my parents for the way they taught me life lessons early on, especially for not letting me take a day off even when I wanted to. I worked for a local grocery store chain in just about every position, from grocery to floral, to the meat department. At the time, I didn&#8217;t realize it, but I was learning what &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; really means.
I was born and raised in Grand Rapids, which makes West Michigan my home, and I absolutely love it here. However, in my role as Kentico MVP, I&#8217;ve had many opportunities to experience a number of places around the US and the world. That said, I&#8217;m pretty sure that Las Vegas is the 2nd best place on earth for me. I’ve never met a Roulette table I didn’t like.

Most of my life has been spent in the West Michigan area — Jenison, Allendale, Grand Rapids, and now Rockford, with a brief stint in Fort Lauderdale.
I graduated from Grand Valley State University in 2003, and went on to work at a mortgage company in IT for a year and a half. After a year and a half I was transferred down to the Fort Lauderdale branch. I stayed for more than a year, and it was definitely a great experience, but I eventually made my way back to Michigan.

BizStream isn’t a typical office. There’s no bureaucracy or red tape to get stuff done. If you have an idea, you can start and run with it. We’re pretty open to new things and to changing things for the better. No one here is stuck in their ways.
The atmosphere here is pretty laid back. Everyone’s great — we’re all friends. We’re all kind of similar in the way we think about work and life. Here, work isn’t the thing you have to go to every day; it’s a place you get to go to.
Traveling is something I’d like to do more. As a kid, my family traveled all over America. Later in life, I’ve gone to Jamaica, London, and honeymooned in Paris and Cannes, France. I would like to go back to London. I like the idea of being in a foreign country without a language barrier. You get to see a different culture, but don’t feel walled off from everyone. I also want to go to Hawaii, Italy, Iceland, and maybe the Netherlands would be cool too. Oh, and to New Zealand to see the Lord of the Rings sets.
Since I&#8217;ve been out in the real world, I&#8217;ve learned that patience with new technology is essential. That old Yoda quote inspires me to hang in there when I&#8217;m figuring out stuff: &#8220;Do or do not. There is no try.&#8221;

I have been managing large-scale projects since 2006 and am a certified Project Manager and Scrum Master. I came to BizStream in August of 2015, and to be honest, I didn’t have much of a background in developing websites at that time. However, organizing, solving problems, and helping people figure out how to work together is my passion. I wear many hats as the Head of Operations, a Team Lead, and a Project Manager. Due to this, my primary role changes day-to-day.
One thing I have discovered since I have been here is that I also love finding great people to come work with us. Our people make up most of our great culture, so it is truly awesome sharing it with others and helping them see if they would be a good fit and know that they can contribute to our culture immediately. One thing I have found to be true since day one is that BizStream is the kind of company that I would have built given the opportunity. Everyone here is empowered to make a difference.
My background is actually in Communications. I graduated from GVSU with a film degree and spent the first several years of my career in the video production industry. It was there that I first learned about producing and project management and found I might have a knack for it. I’ve also found that working in the web world is not that different from the video world. I’ve been managing people since I was 18. I’ve had various managing positions since then, learning a lot as I go. I’ve found that managing people can be one of the most rewarding and most challenging parts of my job, but I wouldn’t change a thing.
When I’m not working, I love spending time with my wife, four kids, and dog. I absolutely love movies of all kinds. Blockbusters, foreign films, cult classics, etc. You name it; I’ll check it out. I also love cooking, backpacking, camping, and working out.

He also enjoys reminiscing about last week like it&#8217;s the golden age of history. Oh, and there&#8217;s Burger, his loyal dog and sidekick during bike polo matches, who might actually be the brains behind all of this.

BizStream Recognized on Inc. 5000 List for Second Time
For the second time, BizStream makes the Inc. 5000, at no. 3,921 in 2024, with three-year revenue growth of 117%!
ALLENDALE, MI, August 13, 2024 – Inc. revealed today that BizStream ranks No. 3,921 on the 2024 Inc. 5000, its annual list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.
We’re thrilled to be recognized on the Inc. 5000 list as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. This honor reflects the dedication, innovation, and hard work of our amazing team. Our growth comes from strong relationships with our clients and our commitment to delivering services and products that meet their evolving needs. We’re excited to keep moving forward and are grateful for the support of our clients, partners, and incredible team.
The Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.
Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, location, and other criteria, go to inc.com/inc5000. All 5000 companies are featured on Inc.com starting Tuesday, August 13, and the top 500 appear in the new issue of Inc. magazine, available on newsstands beginning Tuesday, August 20.
One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list. To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.
More about Inc. and the Inc. 5000
Methodology
Companies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2020. They must be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2023. (Since then, some on the list may have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2020 is $100,000; the minimum for 2023 is $2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Growth rates used to determine company rankings were calculated to four decimal places.
About Inc.

Through its journalism, Inc. aims to inform, educate, and elevate the profile of our community: the risk-takers, the innovators, and the ultra-driven go-getters who are creating our future. Inc.’s award-winning work achieves a monthly brand footprint of more than 40 million across a variety of channels, including events, print, digital, video, podcasts, newsletters, and social media.

The recognition that comes with inclusion on this and other prestigious Inc. lists, such as Female Founders and Power Partners, gives the founders of top businesses the opportunity to engage with an exclusive community of their peers, and credibility that helps them drive sales and recruit talent.

BizStream Receives Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni Award
BizStream has been recognized as one of the 2023 awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. BizStream was acknowledged on stage at the in-person awards ceremony during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala on May 2, 2023.
The Michigan 50 Great Place to Work Award recognizes a previous Michigan 50 Companies to Watch recipient for increased contributions to its community and for fostering a creative, collaborative workplace culture to enhance performance and sustain a competitive advantage.
Creating a positive work environment where our team members can grow, learn, thrive, and maintain a healthy work-life balance has always been a top priority for us at BizStream; it’s actually one of the main reasons I wanted to start my own company. We believe that a happy and fulfilled team leads to better work and happy clients. This award is a validation of our efforts, and we will continue to prioritize our team’s well-being as we grow and serve our clients.
We are thrilled to be recognized as a Great Place to Work by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. At BizStream, we understand that creating a positive work environment is essential to building a successful business.

BizStream Is a GREAT Place to Work, but It&#8217;s NOT for Everyone
Keeping the BizStream Vision
When BizStream started in 2001 it was small and made up of mostly friends and family. We were all on the same page and everyone knew what BizStream was about. But as we grew and as we brought on more people, we slowly began to realize that maybe our vision wasn’t being seen by everyone. The “BizStream way” was becoming blurred. As much as we hate to have a bunch of rules in place and things in writing, it became pretty clear that if we wanted to keep our unique culture and [kick-ass] work ethic, that we needed to lay it out in black and white for our people. Because, as much as we aren’t about a bunch of rules, we are about complete transparency, setting our team up for success, and keeping BizStream an awesome place to work for hard-working people. As our team continues to grow we want to make sure we’re bringing people on that are a great fit for BizStream, and on the flip side, that they can somewhat easily determine if this is a place that they want to be a part of before they even walk into an interview with us.
It became pretty apparent that we needed to do a few things:
Core Focus
The first thing our leadership team wanted to define was BizStream’s Core Focus. We started by asking ourselves questions like, “Why do we get up in the morning? Why does BizStream exist?” And after a fairly quick discussion, most of us came to a very similar reason. We finalized our Core Focus as:
Build cool stuff, with cool people, and have a positive impact on others.
We feel it really hits the nail on the head. We love technology, we love building cool things and we also know that the majority of our waking hours are spent at work. So, if we are spending that much time at work, we better enjoy it. We believe it is our team that makes us WANT to come to work versus the majority of the workforce, that DREADS coming to work. I’ve said it in the past, “I want to go to work every day and write code with my friends”, that’s why I started BizStream, and it’s really important to me that we keep it that way. The last part of our core focus, “have a positive impact on others” is because Brian (co-founder) and I want to work with people that are not just here for themselves. It’s a big world out there and we strongly feel one of the best things we can do as a human is to positively impact as many other people as possible. It also means doing as much in the community as we can. This is why many of us at BizStream are coaches, scoutmasters, youth group leaders, robotics team advisers, BizStream Academy mentors and so much more. Many of us especially love working with youth, education, and technology.
Our Niche
Now it was time to define what we do, what we are the best at, how we are unique, and the kind of projects we excel at.  We’ve always excelled in using software to find solutions to unique, complicated problems. It’s what we love to do. Our team gets excited from digging into complex issues and discovering new ways to solve them with programming. One of the common phrases you’ll hear around here is “We are experts in things we’ve never done before”. Of course, that only refers to the world of programming. I wouldn’t ask our team members to land a 747 or do brain surgery. But when it comes to programming and complex integrations, “we got this”. After all that, we landed with this as our niche:
Solving complex problems with code.
We enjoy working on the hard stuff. We love it when we hear that a different vendor told the client that “it’s impossible, or too complex, or just too hard”&#8230; hah! Bring it on. We aren’t really into making yet another simple, static brochure site that has nothing complicated going on in it. However, if it is e-commerce, multilingual, multi-site, tapping into multiple 3rd-party APIs, pulling data from an ERP, CRM or 10 other systems … our ears are perking up, and we are already thinking about possible solutions to propose to the client. These are the types of projects that our processes and teams are optimized for. Honestly, we are overkill for the smaller, simpler problems that Wix or Square Space are much better suited for.
Our niche not only explains what we specialize in, but it also highlights what we DON’T do. We are very much the IMPLEMENTERS of a project. Already have a great design agency or marketing department, or you want to use one of our design resources? Great! We have worked with many scenarios where we leverage our internal resources as well as external resources that specialize in high-end design, graphic artistry, content writing, marketing strategies, and UX, and we know how to implement their concepts and bring them to life. We know enough to know how to implement a good marketing strategy, but we are not the ones that will come up with it from scratch.
Core Values
The last step for us was to define our Core Values. While we’ve always lived by these values, we never actually stopped to take the time to really think about them and put them down on paper. It was a great experience to think about each of our team members and clearly define which qualities and characteristics stood out. We pretty much laid out the model of what we wanted all future employees to look like. So, these are the Core Values that our team lives and breathes:
Whatever It Takes
Work Hard, Play Hard
We Are a Team
Be Fearless
Foster Growth in Others
Care
Be Positive
Update October 2021 &#8211; I&#8217;ve recently realized two of our core values, whatever it takes and work hard, play hard, have picked up some negative connotations within the industry, so I wanted to clarify what these 20-year-old core values really mean to Team BizStream.
Whatever It Takes
What it may mean to other companies: At some companies, whatever it takes means literally doing whatever it takes to accomplish a task, complete a project, or land a big sale. This may mean working long hours at the expense of time with your friends and family, sacrificing your mental health, or doing things you’re morally uncomfortable doing.
What it means to BizStream: At BizStream, however, whatever it takes means going above and beyond for the good of the team because we are stronger when we work together than we are working with only our own interests or our own projects in mind. We don’t want anyone getting left behind. It’s not just at the employee level either. Whatever it takes means the owners take care of our employees, their families, and our communities. Leadership will do whatever it takes to ensure our team members have what they need to succeed &#8211; extra help on a project, a last-minute mental health day, maybe even an advanced HSA payment when unexpected medical issues arise. When we do whatever it takes for each other, we are a stronger unit. Whatever it takes also means that our clients are well taken care of. To us, it’s not always about the bottom line. Yes, we are a business; we need to make money, but giving a little extra here and there is ok too, especially if it is impactful to our client.
Work Hard, Play Hard
What it may mean to other companies: Your boss expects a 60-hour workweek out of you while they frequently head out of the office early. You have an extremely stressful deadline, but your leadership team is nowhere to be found and leaves you feeling unsupported. YOU work hard, while THEY play hard. Does that sound familiar to you?
What it means to BizStream: At BizStream, work hard, play hard doesn’t mean working long hours. Actually, if our managers see one of their team members consistently putting in more than 45 hours a week, they will meet with that team member to understand why and make a plan to them get back to their standard 40-42 hours. We make it a point to monitor hours for many reasons &#8211; One, we want our people to spend their non-working time with their friends and family and hobbies. Two, we want to avoid burnout and unneeded stress.
Nevertheless, we expect our team to put in a SOLID, productive 40 hours (not a half-assed 40); that’s what work hard means at BizStream. We don’t want our people spending 60 hours at work where 20 of those hours are unproductive. At BizStream, we take on challenging projects with tight timelines. So when our team is on the clock, it is GO TIME. The owners and the leadership team live and breathe a strong work ethic, and we expect the same from the rest of our team. We like to get stuff done. When our whole team is working hard, we are unstoppable and can accomplish anything, including having a fun environment. Our play hard time is just as important to us (a quick foosball match, organized social hours, office parties &amp; outings, etc.) because it allows our team to decompress and get to know each other on a personal level. I believe our team works better when they are confident that everyone is pulling their weight; It also makes our playtime that much sweeter &#8211; because the team knows we all crushed it to make our fun times happen. Because of this, I believe working hard and playing hard go hand in hand.
Now back to the original post&#8230;
Shout out to a local dev shop in Grand Rapids, MI Atomic Object. While we have Care as one of our main core value, one of our sub-points of Care is “Give a shit”, which is one of AO’s values that we’ve always admired. We tried and tried to word it differently, but the statement “Give a shit” is just so perfect and true. AO is another company with great Core Values.
I want to make it clear that although we’re all following the same core values, this doesn’t mean we lose our individuality. There is a ton (some would argue too much) of individuality at BizStream. We all have different backgrounds and ideas. But with all of us following the core values, we know we are a team, and we truly care about each person on our team and the work that we deliver to our clients. Having core values allows us to take a step back and ask ourselves if what we’re doing is in line with the BizStream Core Values and Focus. Essentially, for the greater good of the company. If it’s not, we need to re-think what we’re doing and how we’re doing it. We can have very strong yet healthy discussions and still come up with great solutions because we are not afraid to say our viewpoint or disagree with someone else&#8217;s. It’s all good, as long as it’s done in a positive and constructive way.
It has been an amazing experience to be a part of BizStream as we have begun to solidify the concept of “this is who we are!” The values have always been there, back to when BizStream was made up of only two people. Now we are integrating core values into every aspect of BizStream and using them to take BizStream to the next level. It takes the right kind of person to not only survive but also thrive at BizStream. Defining these core values will do just that to keep BizStream a great place to work.
Being Successful at BizStream
Okay, so, if you are reading this blog post, and you are interested in working at BizStream, here is the part where I am going to try to scare some of you off.
If you are the type that wants to come to work, punch in their 40 hours, and never think about work during your off time, that is great … but you probably won’t fit in well at BizStream. There are plenty of jobs out there where you can do that, just not here. Part of BizStream’s DNA is to do Whatever it Takes, Work Hard and Play Hard, Be a Team and Care. So, that means, after-hours or on the weekends, we might be hanging out together doing something cool, or working out together at the local CrossFit gym, helping someone out at their house, or occasionally staying a little late at the office to get something done. You’ll also find a lot of us doing community work or volunteering to teach kids how to code. But we’re doing that because we care and because … we give a shit.If you follow our social media, you’ve probably noticed that we have a ton of fun. Because we DO Play Hard here. From parties (while most other companies are working) to having mini coolers all throughout the office stocked with microbrews, to team backpacking trips, and a ton more. We have a lot of fun. But the flip side to that is when we are working, we work really hard. If you are the type that likes to go to work, and kind of pretend like you are working, do half social media, news, online shopping, chatting, whatever other non-working stuff and half kinda pretend you are working … you are going to stand out like a sore thumb and BizStream is going to be very uncomfortable for you.
We do this job because we love it. Those of us that are programmers love programming, we talk about at work on the clock and off the clock. We are always looking for the next new thing. Is every project in the building the most exciting thing in the world to work on? No. But do we make the best of it, and try to balance the fun, cool technologies with the older, legacy stuff? Yes. And it’s not just our programmers. This mindset carries on throughout our QA, PM, Marketing, Sales, and IT teams.
Wrap Up
We’ve spent a lot of time recently re-visiting why BizStream was started in the first place and how to keep it that way. BizStream was and will always be a place where awesome people come to do kick-ass work, celebrate their accomplishments, and help others along the way. Not everyone is into that style of work, and that’s okay. They just aren’t for us, and hopefully, now we (BizStream) and the person interested in the job can realize that much sooner, saving everyone time and frustrations. The team members who are a great fit for BizStream now have everything laid out for them; core focus, niche, and core values. They can apply any or all of those ideas in their day-to-day to help them be the best they can be at BizStream, which helps BizStream be the best it can be.

4 Tips for Maximizing Your Internship Experience
If you&#8217;re embarking on an internship and uncertain about what to anticipate, you&#8217;re not alone. In this blog post, I will share some valuable insights I gained as an intern at BizStream. Whether you&#8217;re about to start your internship or are planning to pursue one in the future, the tips I&#8217;ll be covering can help you make the most of your experience.
1. Learn the Culture
Every company has a different culture, so it’s important to know what sort of culture you may be getting involved in. One way you can get a glimpse of that culture is by taking a look at their social media posts. It’s not uncommon for companies to post fun things they do, but that is often just a small glimpse into the company. Another effective approach to gaining insight into a company&#8217;s culture and other important details is to review its website. By exploring a company&#8217;s website, you can gain valuable information on its values, work environment, dress code, and more. It&#8217;s important to note that neglecting to visit a company&#8217;s website before an interview or expressing interest in an internship may send the message that you haven&#8217;t done your research and lack a genuine interest in the organization. Another effective way to get a feel for the company&#8217;s culture is to participate in company events whenever possible. I fell in love with BizStream’s unique culture through everyday experiences and events like our annual golf outing and camping trip.
It&#8217;s important to remember that not every company is the same. By learning about the company&#8217;s culture, interns can navigate their roles and interactions with colleagues more effectively, ultimately leading to a more successful internship experience.
2. Know How to Make the Most of Your Time
Internships are a learning experience. Companies invest in interns to help them gain valuable knowledge and expertise in their chosen fields. This is the time for you to explore the working world and see how it relates to your education and career expectations. Your internship may exceed your expectations or fall short, but the focus should be on learning. Most of your learning will occur through everyday tasks, but don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your colleagues for recommendations on additional resources such as books, videos, or articles to expand your knowledge.
At BizStream, we embrace our core value of Foster Growth in Others, so our team is always willing to lend a helping hand. So when I encountered a challenge or needed assistance, I spoke up and asked for help. This proved extremely helpful for me both during my internship and now as a web developer.
3. Make Connections With Your Co-workers
During your internship, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to work alongside professionals who have been in your field for years. These individuals have a wealth of knowledge and experience you can learn from. Take the initiative to learn from them by asking questions about their experiences and career paths. You may be surprised at the valuable insights they can provide.
By learning about their experiences, you can gain insight into the history of your field and what changes have occurred over the years. This knowledge can help you better understand the industry and its trends, which can be valuable as you progress in your own career.
Finally, your co-workers may have insights and advice that can help you have the most positive experience during your internship. For example, they may be able to offer guidance on how to navigate challenges or how to make the most of your time in the company. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for their opinions and recommendations—their input can be extremely valuable.
4. Have Fun
In my experience, internships are relatively low-pressure situations. Although you will have some responsibilities and general expectations to fulfill, you can still enjoy yourself by finding ways to have fun with the tasks at hand. If you are passionate about the field, focus on learning as much as possible and finding enjoyment in your work. Looking back on your internship, you will likely find that it provided you with more benefits than you would have received from treating it solely as a class required for your degree.
Bonus Tip! - BizStream Academy
In 2016, I enrolled in the BizStream Academy coding bootcamp, which proved to be a game-changer for me. Thanks to the skills I acquired through the program, I later secured an internship with BizStream in 2022, eventually leading to a full-time position in 2023. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in coding and based in West Michigan. It&#8217;s an excellent opportunity to gain valuable skills and potentially open doors to exciting career opportunities!
Final Thoughts
While each intern&#8217;s experience may be different, these useful tips can help you make the most of your time as an intern by acquiring valuable skills, enjoying your work, and cultivating a strong work ethic. It&#8217;s important to keep in mind that your internship may lead to a job opportunity (as mine did), so it&#8217;s crucial to maintain a balance between having fun and demonstrating a strong work ethic. By following these tips and staying committed to your goals, you can maximize your internship experience and set yourself up for success in your future career. So, go ahead and embrace your internship experience with confidence and enthusiasm!

Why Working at a Digital Agency is Great for Junior Developers
As a self-taught developer who transitioned from a career in healthcare, I know firsthand how challenging it is to be new to the tech industry. However, working for a digital agency like BizStream has provided me with numerous advantages and opportunities to grow as a developer. Since starting as an intern in October 2022, I have progressed to a junior developer and learned so much from working alongside a diverse team of experts. In this blog post, I&#8217;ll explore some of the many benefits of working for a digital agency such as BizStream and how it can help new developers like myself gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals.
1. Coordinated Approach to Online Strategy
One major advantage of working for a digital agency like BizStream is the opportunity to work with a diverse team of experts with a wide range of skill sets. This allows new developers to expand their knowledge and experience in different areas of digital development, including branding, web design, web development, digital strategy, consulting, CMS platform selection, and more. No two projects are the same, and it is incredibly convenient for new developers to have access to a variety of experts within the agency to ask questions and get quick, detailed answers. Having immediate access decreases the amount of time spent muddling through projects and ensures that the work being produced is of high quality. It also helps to streamline communication with clients, as there is no need to send a chain of emails back and forth between the agency and an outside team. As a result, the agency can respond to clients quickly and efficiently, delivering projects on time and within budget.
Furthermore, working with an agency allows new developers to experience a coordinated approach to online strategy. At BizStream, for example, the entire team assigned to each project is privy to the consulting, design, and spin-up processes. By doing this, expectations are shared early on, and there is minimal room for deviation. This approach ensures that everyone involved in the project is working towards the same goals and is aware of the different pieces that make up the whole. It also helps new developers gain a deeper understanding of the impact of their work and the importance of collaboration across different teams.
2. Pushing Boundaries and Gaining Hands-On Experience
In addition to the above, digital agency can provide new developers with the opportunity to work on a variety of projects for different clients. As a result, junior developers are able to build a diverse portfolio and develop their skills in different areas. Working on various projects also allows new developers to learn from experienced developers who can provide mentorship and guidance. This can help new developers improve their skills and develop professionally. Since joining the team at BizStream, I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work on a range of diverse projects, including developing a website for a non-profit hospital system, updating an ecommerce site, building a water sample data reporting site, and will soon be working on an agricultural product and education site. As a junior developer, I am overjoyed by my expanding portfolio and know it is something that I would have struggled to achieve on my own and on this scale.
Another benefit of working for an agency is the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. At BizStream, for example, new developers are constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, such as headless CMS, serverless architecture, and AI/machine learning. With that being the case, we are able to stay ahead of the curve and develop skills that are in high demand in the industry.
3. Career Growth and Sense of Community
Working for digital agency can also provide new developers with opportunities for career growth and advancement. For example, at BizStream, new developers can take on increasing levels of responsibility as they gain experience and prove themselves capable. They can also move into different areas of the agency, such as project management or business development, if they have an interest in those areas.
Finally, working for an agency can give new developers a sense of community and belonging. At BizStream, there is a strong emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, with regular team-building events and opportunities for socializing outside of work. This helps new developers feel like they are part of something bigger than themselves and can help them build lasting relationships with their colleagues.
Final Thoughts
Working for a digital agency like BizStream can provide new developers with a wide range of benefits, including exposure to a diverse team of experts, a coordinated approach to online strategy, the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, mentorship, guidance from experienced developers, the chance to work with cutting-edge technologies, opportunities for career growth, and a sense of community and belonging. These benefits can help new developers gain valuable experience, develop professionally, and achieve their career goals while enjoying their job.

Rise Above the Noise: Tell Your Members a Better Value Story
Do You Feel Like It’s Harder Than Ever to Recruit and Retain Members? You’re Not Alone.
Competition is fierce. Members used to see associations as the exclusive, trusted source of information and connection.
Now, information is everywhere online. And it’s never been easier to access sources that appear authoritative (we’re looking at you, ChatGPT), but ultimately lack depth.
The good news? There’s opportunity. If you can tell a clear, convincing story for why your association is worth the cost—and support that story with a modern website—you can rise above the noise.
Once again, your association will be seen as the go-to source for insights, experience, and leadership no other online source can match.
A Good Story Is Member-First, Clear, and Consistent
Associations leverage multiple channels to tell their story (both on and offline). But how often do you audit those channels to ensure your message is consistent, clear, and relevant to your audience? When was the last time you spoke at length with customers to understand what motivates them?
It’s likely you need to revisit two core elements that comprise your brand story.
Audience Personas
Interviewing members helps you understand the value they derive from your organization and what trends are influencing their behavior.
If you collect the right insights, you’ll have what you need to craft a brand story that identifies what they truly want and how your association can help get them there. That enables you to craft a compelling narrative where your member is the hero, and you are the trusted guide. If they want to overcome their challenges and ultimately realize a better version of themselves, then they need what only you can provide.
Through your persona development work, identify places on your website that really matter to your members and ensure the value proposition is strong.
For example, an association that offers certifications should describe how earning accreditation can boost a member’s career. Or, if you’re an organization with a social-driven mission, make it clear how your members can participate and drive your mission forward.
Brand Messaging and Visual Guide
Once you have a solid grasp of your audience, develop a brand guide. This guide will serve as the source of truth for all team members to share a story that resonates with members in a consistent and clear way—no matter the channel.
Build the Plot
It’s time to carry the brand guide’s core messaging across your website and communication channels.
Remember, stories must always move the reader forward. How does that happen from a brand perspective? Three components must be present: great user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and information architecture (IA).
Start with detailed user journey mapping. This will help you create a sitemap that informs your navigation, making it clear and easy for users to find the information they are looking for.
Surfacing content that’s meaningful is another integral part of keeping visitors engaged. Fortunately, an AI tool such as Algolia Recommends, makes this easy by leveraging live site and user data to enable advanced search capabilities.
Set Up the Sequel
Change is inevitable. How quickly and easily your systems adapt makes all the difference in managing your association&#8217;s story.
Many organizations use rigid content management systems (CMS) that slow down content updates and require frequent developer involvement.
Modern CMS solutions—whether headless, hybrid, or modular—offer greater flexibility, faster workflows, and intuitive editing experiences for non-technical users. They also integrate seamlessly with your existing tools, from member management systems to marketing platforms.
At BizStream, one of our specialties is helping organizations choose and implement the right CMS solution to meet their unique needs—helping build a digital ecosystem that&#8217;s agile, scalable, and ready for whatever comes next.
But building a modern digital experience isn&#8217;t just about technology—it&#8217;s about telling a story that sets your association apart. Partnering with an experienced team like BizStream ensures your website not only works better, but also tells your story in a way that resonates.
Ready to rediscover the story that captivates your members? Let&#8217;s talk.

Helping Associations Build Inclusive Digital Experiences: Join BizStream at CSAE’s Upcoming Webinar
Creating inclusive digital experiences is no longer a nice-to-have—it’s essential for associations striving to serve diverse audiences effectively. That’s why BizStream is excited to partner with the Colorado Society of Association Executives (CSAE) for an upcoming webinar focused on web accessibility. On April 24, join Rob Bean of BizStream and Kelly Jan of Recite Me as they share practical strategies to help associations move beyond compliance and build websites that are truly inclusive.
Webinar Overview
Improving Web Accessibility | Building a Culture of Online Inclusivity
From Remediation to Localization and Beyond
Date: Thursday, April 24thTime: 10:00–11:00 AM Mountain Time
For mission-driven organizations, accessibility isn’t just about compliance with a standard or mandate. It’s about creating an inclusive experience for all visitors. Additionally, inclusivity should go beyond simply meeting the letter of a mandate and instead look for ways to provide better access to information and resources for members and other stakeholders.
New technology can broaden accessibility support online by automatically providing language translation for the content on your website, including documents posted online. Furthermore, these technologies can also provide the ability for the site to read the information aloud to the visitor which is important for non-English speakers or for those with reading comprehension difficulty.
But even as your association works to bring your website into compliance with Federal and State accessibility mandates, you’re likely learning about emerging litigation and lawmaking from state, federal, and global agencies that will continue to affect you.
How can you keep up, stay in compliance, and truly meet the needs of your site users?In this practical webinar, you’ll learn where to start—and how to develop a sustainable approach to accessibility governance for your website.
You’ll Come Away Understanding:

Breadth vs. Depth: Which Learning Path Should You Take?
As a developer, continuous learning is more or less part of the job. Because our field is relatively new compared to the majority of other professions out there, the landscape of software development is always changing. It seems like every day, there’s a new language or framework or a new tool that claims to improve your efficiency to the point that you can become the elusive “10x developer” (read more about that in our blog post, Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status).
Due to this, it can be really difficult to keep up with the times if you’re not making a conscious effort to grow your skills and knowledge in this space. As of writing this, I have nearly 9 years of professional development experience. So, even though I’m not exactly a seasoned veteran yet, I do feel I have a pretty good grasp on what has and hasn’t paid off for me when it comes to the learning efforts I’ve put in outside of work, and I hope to share some of those learnings with you.
Depth: Learning Inside Your “Work” Stack
An obvious place to focus your learning efforts would be the same tech you use daily at whatever company you work for. Staying within the scope of what you work with on a regular basis provides a great way to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the types of things you use and run into frequently. This is especially valuable when starting out as a developer or transitioning to a new stack.On the flip side, sticking to only learning things you are already familiar with can limit your growth as a developer. Deepening your knowledge in a particular area is beneficial, but eventually, you’ll start to hit a threshold where the time you’re investing in learning more and more about it is less and less helpful. You basically run into a situation where you’re getting diminishing returns on your time investment.
Breadth: Learning Outside Your “Work” Stack
A less obvious but very beneficial path would be learning things that you don’t use that often (or at all) at your work. This may seem a bit counterintuitive, but there are a handful of benefits to looking outside your norm when it comes to learning on your own time.First, learning outside the scope of your daily work can be a great source of new and fresh ideas for tackling different scenarios that might come up from time to time. Whether that be a new language or something like a new approach to automated deployments, the things you learn along the way can influence your approach to the problems you face at work, even if you never plan to use the exact same technologies.Secondly, depending on how variable your work environment is, there’s also the possibility that the things you’ve learned on the side might become directly applicable to a project you end up taking on at work. This comes down to random chance, unfortunately, if you don’t get much say in how your organization works, but if you have the ability to share your thoughts and ideas to change the direction of technology adoption, then this is a great way to test out new stuff and potentially get your organization to move to something new. (Disclaimer: just because something is new doesn’t make it better)
Case Studies
As mentioned earlier, I wanted to share some of my own experiences to shed some light on this topic. Below are some recent examples of how my learnings outside the typical BizStream stack have paid off for me.
Linux Hosting
Since BizStream has primarily been a .NET shop since its inception, pretty much every project I’ve been on in the past has been hosted in a Windows environment. Whether that be On-Prem with IIS or in Azure App Services, that’s the world I’ve been most familiar with over the past seven years, and it’s what I would default to when hosting my personal projects that I had built outside of work.
However, a little while ago, when I started on my journey with Vim (read my previous blog post, Why Every Developer Should Learn Vim), I realized that Docker runs so much better on Linux. I really started to enjoy working with Linux-based systems. This led me to want to start using Docker on all my personal projects and host them on a Linux VM running Ubuntu.
All the experience that I was gaining from changing up my hosting approach wasn’t being directly used at BizStream for quite some time; it was really just me having fun trying something new.
But recently, with .NET Core becoming increasingly widely used (especially for us now that we’re doing Xperience by Kentico projects), our ongoing efforts to provide headless CMS options, and Next.js being a top contender for those types of projects, there’s been a lot more opportunity to leverage the skills and knowledge I’ve built up in this area.
A recent example of all of this coming in handy was when we needed to help get a site deployed to a Linux VM that didn’t have any prior CI/CD setup, just a Dockerfile in the root of the repo and a docker-compose.yml file on the server. Hopefully, you can see where this is going…
I was able to help out due to the knowledge I had built up on my personal time. This made it so we didn’t have to re-platform them over to another hosting solution, which would’ve been a much bigger lift when they just needed a deployment to fix some issues on their site. I even got to use my Vim skills when we needed to make some small tweaks to the docker-compose.yml file as part of our changes.
Learning C
For the entirety of my professional development career, my work has been with high-level languages like C# and Javascript, and the lowest-level language I’ve ever worked with was a C++ class back in college. This past December I decided I would attempt to see how far I could get in the Advent of Code challenge with all my solutions being written in C.I unfortunately didn’t get to devote as much time to this as I had hoped, but I still managed to solve 8 problems (the first 4 days worth) using nothing but C.It took me quite a while to wrap my head around solving many of those problems with the limitations that come with a low-level language. I didn’t realize how much I relied on things like dynamic length lists, Linq, and simple things like having an integer array as a parameter to a function (well, the last one is accomplished with pointers in C, but that’s a whole other fun topic). I also had to be very explicit in my memory allocation, which isn’t usually something I need to think about when writing C# or Javascript code.While I haven’t needed to write C code at BizStream since then (and most likely never will), I did at least gain the experience of needing to find new ways to solve what are typically simple problems. When I’d come back to these high-level languages after writing a handful of C, it got me thinking about ways to make my code more efficient by being a bit more aware of the space complexity of my code.
Final Thoughts
Although I’ve spent the majority of this blog post discussing why I think focusing on the tech you don’t normally use in your daily work is more beneficial to your overall growth as a developer, I want to make it abundantly clear that I think anything you do outside your typical 9–5 work is awesome, and strongly believe it will help you to grow faster than those who don’t put in the extra effort. Being a developer and staying on top of the ever-changing landscape can feel daunting at times, but hopefully, you went into this field and stuck with it because you enjoy the learning process, and continuously strive to be a better developer today than you were yesterday.

BizStream at Merge 2025: Blending Product Thinking with Software Modernization
Merge is a one-day tech conference taking place on April 28, 2025, at Daniel and Pamella DeVos Center for Interprofessional Health in Grand Rapids, MI. It’s a celebration of innovation, product development, software design, and the future of tech—all packed into one energizing day hosted by SoftwareGR.
As a proud sponsor of this year&#8217;s event, BizStream is excited to contribute to a community that shares our passion for building forward-thinking digital products. And we’re not just sponsoring—we’re speaking, too.
Don’t Miss This Session
Blending Product Thinking with Software Modernization
Time: 9:55 AM – 10:40 AM
In the world of software, products and systems don’t just remain static—they evolve, accumulate technical debt, and sometimes become an unmanageable mess of outdated frameworks, workarounds, and fragile dependencies. When dealing with a 15-year-old platform, the question isn’t just how to modernize but what to modernize.
Should you refactor piece by piece or completely rebuild? What about adding that new feature your Product Owner wants? The answer isn’t always obvious.
This session explores how blending product thinking with software modernization leads to better outcomes. Brian and Dave will walk through the lens of long-term product strategy, user needs, and business value—backed by real-world lessons from BizStream’s own SaaS platform, YouthCenter.
YouthCenter is a case study in modernizing a complex, decade-old system. You’ll learn how BizStream approached modernization not as a one-time rewrite but as a product-driven evolution, balancing technical constraints with customer expectations.
By shifting the focus from rewriting old code to delivering ongoing value, development teams can avoid the rebuild trap. Instead, they can embrace an iterative approach that promotes longevity, adaptability, and sustainability.
Whether you’re currently leading a legacy transformation or trying to avoid one in the future, this talk will showcase smart modernization decisions that don’t require hitting pause on the business.

2 Trends All Member-Based Organizations Need to Know
The digital landscape for member-based organizations is evolving quickly—and with it, the expectations of your members.
Shifting member behaviors, rising digital competition, and increasing demands for value have elevated the importance of brand differentiation and a modern, high-performing website. Revenue streams like events, education, and training are no longer guaranteed. Online engagement is fragmented. And organizations are realizing that outdated strategies and legacy technology are limiting their growth.
If you&#8217;re an association, nonprofit, or higher education institution, you may be asking:
How can we re-engage members and grow our reach?
How do we deliver clear, compelling value?
What steps do we take to modernize and stay competitive?
Leading organizations are answering these questions by embracing two powerful trends:
Telling a better story (strategic branding)
Building a better website (technology modernization)
Together, these two strategies help organizations clarify their value, connect with key audiences, and fuel sustainable growth.
If your team needs help with digital strategy or website development, connect with us. BizStream has helped organizations like yours achieve measurable success through smart branding and modern technology solutions.
1. Strengthen Your Value-Based Storytelling
Even a beautifully designed website can underperform if your messaging doesn’t resonate. At the core of every successful digital experience is a story—and that story needs to be rooted in value.
To tell a compelling story, you must first understand your audiences: their goals, frustrations, and how they make decisions. With this insight, you can shape messaging that reflects your organization’s purpose and draws members in.
Unfortunately, many organizations bury their most valuable messages or speak in ways that don’t connect. When your audience can’t quickly understand your impact, they lose interest—or never engage in the first place.
Revitalize Your Message Around Value
You know your mission. But do your members and prospects?Persona-driven research helps you uncover what matters most to your audience—so you can better communicate how your organization supports their needs.
Focus on Better Content
Once you understand your audience’s journey, you can craft content that educates, inspires, and drives action. Use those insights to:
Position your organization as a thought leader
Build content that deepens member engagement
Develop messaging that speaks to prospects’ real challenges
Reinforce your unique value and purpose
Better content builds long-term loyalty and boosts conversions by aligning with what your audience actually wants.
2. Build a Better Membership Website
Today’s website isn’t just a marketing tool—it’s your organization’s digital hub. Whether your focus is engagement, events, or education, a modern website experience is central to how you deliver value.
Here are a few key ways to improve your site’s performance while solving complex problems and reducing operational overhead:
Prioritize User Experience
Members expect intuitive, seamless experiences. But disconnected systems and clunky workflows often stand in the way.By taking an integrative approach—one that connects your technology stack and aligns digital touchpoints—you can streamline the experience and make it easier for users to take meaningful action.
Modernize Your Technology
Staying competitive requires technology that’s flexible, scalable, and fast. Member-based organizations are increasingly adopting:
Cloud-based infrastructure
API-first architectures
Modernized CMS platforms
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance personalization and insights
Modern systems allow your teams to move faster, reduce technical debt, and deliver better results.
Choose Best-of-Breed Tools
All-in-one platforms often overpromise and underdeliver. Instead, many organizations are turning to Best-of-Breed solutions—tools that specialize in doing one thing exceptionally well.
With an API-first, modular approach, you can:
Adapt quickly to change
Lower licensing costs
Minimize risk
Launch new features faster
At BizStream, we specialize in helping organizations architect smart, modern tech stacks that balance performance and sustainability.
Need guidance on how to start? We’d love to help you modernize your tech stack, strengthen your message, and engage your members in new and powerful ways. Let’s talk.

About AAM’s Annual Conference
AAM’s Annual Summit provides excellent educational opportunities through keynote speakers, breakout sessions, and deep-dive content blocks for every level of marketer and business developer. And if you think the education is great, wait until you experience the networking!

Brian McKeiver’s Session at AAM Summit 2025
Personalization: Deliver the Right Content to the Right Visitor at the Right Time
Too often, we hear the words &#8216;personalization is a phase 2 item.&#8217; The problem with that mindset is that overlooking website personalization can leave visitors feeling disconnected and frustrated. You miss the chance to have your content truly resonate with that visitor’s core needs, making it harder to convert them into potential clients. Personalization isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a strategic advantage that drives meaningful interactions and business growth. This session will show why taking a personalization-first approach on your firm’s website can create a more engaging, client-focused experience that delivers results.
Date: Tuesday, May 13, 2025
Time: 11:35 AM – 12:00 PM MST
Session Type: Micro Learning Case Study

Xperience by Kentico’s Taxonomies: What’s New &amp; Why It Matters
If you manage digital content, organization is key. A well-structured site makes content easier to manage, improves SEO, and enhances user experience.
That’s where taxonomies come in.
Taxonomies help organize and tag content so users can find what they need faster. Whether you&#8217;re organizing blog posts or product categories, taxonomies make it easier.
With Xperience by Kentico, taxonomies received a major upgrade. They are now more flexible, scalable, and easier to manage than in Kentico 13. Let’s explore what’s changed and why marketers should be excited.
What’s New? Taxonomies in Xperience vs. Kentico 13
While Kentico 13 had taxonomy support, Xperience by Kentico has made the following key improvements:
1. Easier Content Filtering in the Content Hub
Xperience’s Content Hub now fully integrates taxonomies, making it easier to:
This is a major time saver for marketers managing hundreds or thousands of pieces of content.
2. Omnichannel Taxonomy Support
Kentico 13’s taxonomies were primarily focused on web content, but Xperience expands their use across multiple channels out of the box, including:
This allows content to be categorized the same way across all channels, making personalization easier and helping teams reuse content more effectively.
Why Marketers Should Be Excited About These Changes?
These updates aren’t just technical improvements, they directly benefit marketing teams by making content easier to organize, discover, and personalize.
1. Faster, More Accurate Content Discovery
With better taxonomy structure and multiple classifications, users can find what they need faster through site search, navigation menus, or structured content lists.Better discoverability also means improved SEO, as search engines can better understand and rank your content.
2. Better Personalization
Strong taxonomies help organize content effectively, ensuring the right people get relevant content at the right time.For example:
Xperience makes it easier to personalize content across different channels by keeping taxonomies consistent across all your digital platforms.Also, combining taxonomies in Xperience By Kentico with smart folders offers marketers a dynamic way to deliver content. By tagging content items with taxonomy tags, editors can create smart folders that automatically group related content based on these tags. This setup allows widgets to display up-to-date content without manual selection. This approach is a significant improvement over Kentico 13, where such dynamic content delivery required more manual effort.
3. Less Content Chaos, More Efficiency
Managing large amounts of content can quickly get messy, especially when multiple teams are involved. The new taxonomy system keeps everything structured so marketers can:
Instead of spending hours searching for content, teams can focus more on content strategy.
Final Thoughts
The taxonomy improvements in Xperience by Kentico are more than just an upgrade. They’re a game changer for content organization and management.These enhancements give marketing teams greater control, flexibility, and efficiency compared to Kentico 13. Whether you manage an e-commerce site, a corporate blog, or a content marketing platform, this update simplifies content management. If you&#8217;re moving to Xperience by Kentico or thinking about doing so, this is a feature worth getting excited about.

How to Connect with—and Win—Customers: Build Better Buyer Personas
When marketers build messaging, they typically start by understanding the unique value of their company, products, and services. But just as important is understanding your customers: their roles, their pains, their business priorities and goals, their part in decision making—and their distinct buying journeys.
When you are in tune with your customers and prospects, you have the means to help them get over the pain of change and adopt the new opportunities your solutions offer. The most common reason your prospects say no is that change is painful or difficult. When you have detailed personas, you can create messaging to demonstrate how your product or service benefits them, how they can leverage your solutions to improve their situations and positively impact their companies.
Personas let you get into that prospect’s shoes and ask, “If I put on NEW shoes, do my feet feel better? Can I run faster with greater efficiency? Can I perform at a higher level?”Improving sales by changing the way you talk to your customers might also require your team to overcome the pain of change. But when you take the time to develop personas for all your different potential buyers—and then apply those insights to all the tactics in your marketing strategy—you’re already a step closer to winning more sales.
Why You Can’t Skip This Step: Put the Customer Front and Center
Building messaging around specific buyer personas—and creating content to support them through each stage of their journey with you—is central to the success of any marketing effort. Most marketers know this basic principle, but surprisingly few organizations build and use personas and messaging consistently or revisit them as a resource once they’ve been developed.
Detailed personas for all your customers create a foundation for accomplishing several core goals:
Growing Your Framework: How Do You Learn?
If you aren’t sure where to begin your customer research, we recommend starting with the most direct routes.
First, Interview Current Customers.
Reaching out to customers you know are happy—and a few that perhaps are less satisfied—will help you answer questions such as:
What is their industry?
What is their role within their company?
What are their daily responsibilities?
What are their priorities?
What prevents them from meeting those responsibilities and goals?
Who do they report to?
Who must they consult to make a buying decision?
Why do they need a solution like yours and how badly do they need it?
How exactly can your solution’s unique value help them reach their goals or meet their obligations?
What benefits will they gain from using your solution?
What objections or concerns are they likely to have about your solution?
No Matter What, Talk to Sales.
For the most current insights into what’s going on with customers, reach out to your sales team. They spend their days talking to customers and prospects, so they have a wealth of information that you can use to create persona messaging. They can also help you better understand the specific benefits and features that generate the “aha” moments on a sales call.
Your sales team can also fill in details about how customers move through the buyer journey:
Are your ideal customers aware that a problem or need exists?
Are they aware of the causes of the problem?
Do they know that a solution exists?
Are they aware of your product or service and that it provides a solution to the problem or need?
What questions do they have about your solution?
What is their view of your solution compared to options from your competitors?
Are they aware of your successes for other customers?
Do they understand how to use your product or service?
Are they interested in learning more? If so, which products or features interest them most?
Are they willing to talk with you? If not, are they willing to read, listen to, or watch more information?
Get to Know Your Real Buyers
You can’t please everyone. Fortunately, you don’t need to. The key to marketing success isn’t just connecting with an audience, it’s connecting with the right audience—at the right time.
Using the answers to these questions, you can create persona messaging and use it to keep customers at the center of your content strategy. Refer to your messaging regularly to verify that everything you create, from websites to white papers, communicates the benefits of your solution when applied to your customers’ real needs.
In conjunction with your persona messaging, an understanding of your ideal customer’s buying journey can help you create a successful marketing and content strategy that improves organic search ranking, converts website visitors into qualified leads, and converts leads into sales.
Get Expert Help
The most important takeaway in all of this is to keep the customer at the center of everything your marketing team creates.
Developing personas and mapping content to your customers’ buyer journeys does take time. If bandwidth is tight, partnering with an agency team can provide a dedicated force to complete your messaging tasks.
Look for an agency that can also help you determine—

I&#8217;ll also show you a unique estimating method that has worked for me, which you can take back to your own team.
I&#8217;m hopeful that sharing my experience of creating the majority of estimates at my company over the past 22 years will help you estimate more quickly and accurately.
At the end of the day, if you can create better estimates, maybe your project managers and team members will end up becoming long-time friends.
Session 2: MACH based Website Development in Minutes
In today&#8217;s digital landscape, MACH (Microservices, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architecture is revolutionizing the way websites are developed and managed. The MACH mission is to encourage enterprises to switch from traditional single-vendor application suites to a more composable, best-of-breed architecture.
This session will guide you through the process of building scalable, composable, and highly customizable enterprise websites using MACH principles. These are the types of sites that many organizations use to represent their brands, products, and custom B2B e-commerce needs.
We&#8217;ll use Vercel to deploy a Next.JS codebase to the cloud, GitHub Actions to automate deployments, and make it editable with a SaaS-based Headless CMS integration using Kontent.ai.
We will end up with a new website that showcases MACH in action. Leave with an understanding of how a serverless, API-first approach, modern tech stack, and easy deployment path to the cloud provide a globally fast solution without being tied down to a single server or database.

Enhance Kentico 13 Search Index with Azure AI Search Semantic Ranker
As with any technology, search has really come a long way, especially cloud services and integrating those services with your web application. In light of that, we are going to explore adding a basic Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index and how that can dramatically improve your users’ search experience. Let’s jump right in!
Project Details
First, let’s break down what our tech stack looks like.
Assumptions
We should also cover some prerequisites to make sure you know where our starting point is, as this article will not be covering the below items:
NuGet packages
In order to use Semantic ranker, you will need to install newer .NET Core packages to work with the correct objects.We have a class library project, ProjectName.KenticoIntegration. In this project, we are going to install the Azure.Search.Documents package. Chances are you may already have it, but it may need to be updated. Make sure to update it in all of the projects using it.
Implementation
Let’s dig into some code, shall we? There is going to be some refactoring needed, but you are mostly going to be adding to your existing code.When using Azure as a search index, generally, you are going to customize the index process in some way so that you can add your own flavor of content to the index. To provide some context, in our case, we have the following:
We are hooking into several different events with our own custom methods. We will dive into those one by one, as we will need to know what they are doing when creating the methods for configuring the index with a semantic configuration.
Why Do We Need Two Packages and Similar Methods?
You’ll notice later that we have similar processes, but the objects used are from different packages. In the search index customization module, we are utilizing the Microsoft.Azure.Search packages, whereas in the helper class, we’re going to be utilizing the newer Azure.Search.Documents package to aid in creating the semantic ranker. The helper is required specifically to handle the newer Semantic ranker features we will be implementing.
When Kentico has to create and update the index, these search index objects have to match, meaning they both have to have the same configuration; otherwise you will run into errors such as the following:
“Creating or updating index ‘index-name’ failed with the following error: This index has suggesters defined in it that cannot be removed. This error is caused by attempting to update an index without including all of its existing suggesters or by attempting to update an index that was created/updated with a new version of the API.”
Now, let’s get into the actual inner workings of the index creation process.
DefaultSuggester Class
One thing we can do to make our lives a little easier and avoid repetitive code is create a DefaultSuggester class that inherits Suggester (from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models library). We can reuse this across multiple methods, which you will see later. But, for context, here is the class now:
The CreatingField_After Method
In this method, we are setting up the fields that will have our desired attributes—in our case, that’s several filterable and facetable fields for our search page that is already implemented.
The first thing we do is validate the incoming CreateFieldEventArgs parameter, specifically the SearchIndex.IndexCodeName to verify it is indeed the correct index. We then configure our fields with their appropriate values based on our needs:
The CreateSearchFieldsForPage_Execute Method
In this method, we add our fields as necessary, formatting values that require formatting as well.
And for context, here is our AddField method:
The EnhanceSearchIndex Method
This custom method ties everything together.
The method calls two more private methods (AddSuggester and AddSemanticConfiguration), one to set up the suggesters and the other to set up the semantic configuration.
For reference, one of the important things you have to do is make sure to reference the .NET Framework package here. Note the “AzureSearchModels” alias, which we have aliased from the Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models package. More on that momentarily. Let’s take a look at the AddSemanticConfiguration:
Notice we are using the fluent interface design pattern for chaining purposes. As noted above, we are doing all of this with the older package so that things are compatible with Kentico’s process, but we need to extend this with our new class to utilize the new packages and semantic options. We will explore that in a moment in the next section, but first let’s review some of what’s going on with the configuration method above.In our configuration, the semantic title field is associated with the Title field of the node. The content fields for the semantic configuration were just the fields on the node that had a majority of the content that would be matched with a semantic search. We also didn’t have any fields in our case that made sense for the Keywords fields.Another thing to keep in mind with semantic search is how it tokenizes the input and the limit on those tokens. Approximately 20,000 characters will max out the search, meaning if you have fields that are extremely long in your configuration, it could possibly eat up all of the available tokens. This is an important detail, so organizing the fields is crucial to ensure the most relevant fields are included in the search.
Modern SearchIndexHelper class
In our SearchIndexHelper class, located in our KenticoIntegration project, we instantiate a couple of private properties and our constructor. Note that the SearchIndex and the SearchIndexClient (and other objects) are both from the Azure.Search.Documents package. We also alias the older package so we can pass in the legacy field to the WithField method.
We use our search admin key and service name that were retrieved from the key vault and passed in to create our client. After the constructor, there are our chaining methods.
WithField Method
WithSuggesters Method
WithSemanticSearch Method
CreateOrUpdate Method
This is the method that we will call from the customization module code to integrate the two classes, integrating the Kentico CMS with the newer .NET Core packages necessary to work with Semantic ranker.
Final Thoughts
And that is the overall concept of implementing Semantic ranker with your Kentico 13 search index within Azure. With this type of configuration, search results on your website will have a layer of semantic association. The biggest challenge I ran into was integrating the .NET Framework packages of Kentico with the new .NET Core packages. The indexes have to match definitions across both packages, including the suggesters. Adding Semantic ranker to your Kentico 13 search index is a powerful enhancement, even with minimal configuration. If you are using a free search service, you will have to weigh the costs of creating a new Basic plan search service. However, if you are already paying for the Basic plan, it might be a no-brainer to enhance the user experience within your Kentico sites search.Happy coding!

Simple Guide for Creating an Azure AI Search Index in Xperience by Kentico
Xperience by Kentico is the latest modern content management system that Kentico has released. It immediately stands out with its sleek, modern interface, fast navigation, and powerful features. One key feature is the ability to integrate with Azure AI Search. This post outlines the steps to configure a project for Azure AI Search integration and set up the Azure AI Search module in the admin to build a search index using content types defined in Xperience.
Below is what will be used to implement this feature:
Setting up the Project Configuration
The initial steps focus on configuring the project to make Azure AI Search accessible within the Xperience admin interface. This involves installing the Azure Search package for Xperience by Kentico, setting it up in the Program.cs file, and ensuring it&#8217;s recognized in the Xperience admin.
1. Install the Azure AI Search Package for Xperience by Kentico
There are a few ways to install the package:
Success! The Azure AI Search package for Xperience by Kentico is now installed on the project.
2. Add Kentico Azure AI Search to Your Program
Next, open the Program.cs file and call the IServiceCollection extension method AddKenticoAzureSearch, passing it the ConfigurationManager. The line of code should look like this:
The project can now be run. Upon accessing the Xperience admin interface, a new module under Development titled “Azure AI Search” should now be visible.
Configure the Azure AI Search Module to Build the Index
With the program configured to access the Azure AI Search module, the next step is connecting the Azure AI Search service to the application.
These steps involve:
By the end of this process, the Azure AI Search service will be fully connected and ready to handle search queries within the application.
1. Add Azure Keys to User Secrets
If a 500 error occurs when accessing the &#8216;Azure AI Search&#8217; module, it is likely due to missing settings from the search service. To resolve this, right-click the project in Visual Studio and select &#8216;Manage User Secrets.&#8217; Then, paste the following keys:
IMPORTANT: The names of the keys must match exactly what they are named above.
To retrieve the values for these keys, consult the following settings in the Azure AI Search service:
Note: If a query key does not already exist, be sure to create one by clicking the “Add” button, entering a name, and clicking “Done.” This should automatically generate a key to be copied.
After rebuilding the project, returning to the admin, and accessing the module, the error should no longer appear.
2. Creating a Search Strategy
The next step involves developing a strategy for building the search index, ensuring that the fields of the content types are properly mapped. For this example, the NewsDetail and Homepage content types from my “Azure Search Test” Xperience channel will be used.Begin by adding two files to your project: one for the search model and one for the search strategy. In this example, those files will be named XperienceAzureExampleModel and XperienceAzureExampleStrategy, respectively.The model will inherit from the BaseAzureSearchModel that the Xperience Azure Search package provides.
The strategy will inherit from BaseAzureSearchIndexingStrategy&lt;TSearchModel&gt; provided by the Xperience Azure Search package, with the model created earlier used as the TSearchModel. Next, implement the MapToAzureSearchModelOrNull method. This method checks whether the incoming IIndexEventItemModel parameter matches one of the content types intended for inclusion in the search index. If a match is found, the relevant fields from the content type will be mapped to the corresponding fields in the TSearchModel, and the model will be returned.
After implementing the strategy, return to the Program.cs file and update the previous line of code that was implemented earlier to look like this:
With the search strategy now successfully implemented, the next step is to configure the search index in the Xperience admin, preparing it for the indexing process. This will ensure everything is ready for building the index and integrating your search functionality seamlessly.
3. Finalizing Search Index Setup in Xperience
To begin this final step, navigate back to the Azure AI Search module in the Xperience admin. Click the “Create Index” button, then follow these steps: enter the Included Path, select the Included content types (matching those from the search strategy), specify the Index Name, choose the Indexed Languages, select the Channel Name, and finally, choose the indexing strategy implemented earlier from the Indexing Strategy dropdown. Be sure to save the path and then save the index.
In the Azure AI Search module, the index can now be rebuilt by clicking the &#8220;Rebuild&#8221; icon.
Returning to the Azure AI Search service, navigate to Search Management&gt; Indexes. The index should now appear, matching the name specified in Xperience.
The contents of the index should now display only the content types included in the search strategy that have corresponding pages within the Xperience channel.
Final Thoughts
By following these steps, a fully functional integration between Xperience by Kentico and Azure AI Search has been established. The project configuration, search strategy implementation, and search index setup in the Xperience admin now allow content types to be indexed and searched efficiently. This integration not only enhances the search capabilities of the application but also demonstrates the flexibility and power of Xperience when paired with Azure AI Search. With everything in place, the application is ready to handle and optimize search queries, providing users with fast and relevant search results.

Breaking the 10x Developer Hype: Your Path to Rockstar Status
You’ve probably heard the term &#8220;10x software engineer&#8221; thrown around—this mythical creature who is supposedly ten times more productive than their peers, able to churn out code faster, solve problems quicker, and deliver results with superhuman efficiency. Companies drool over the idea of finding a &#8220;10x engineer,&#8221; the one developer who can carry an entire team on their back. But here’s the reality: the idealization of a 10x engineer as the end goal is a myth.
Being a great engineer isn’t about raw output or cranking out ten times the amount of code. It’s about solving problems in the most effective way possible, making smart decisions, and guiding others with well-informed recommendations. The engineers who make the biggest impact aren’t the ones who write the most code—they’re the ones who can navigate complexity, communicate clearly, and steer projects in the right direction. If you can talk the talk and walk the walk, you’re the real 10x software engineer. You’re worth your weight in gold.
The Engineer’s True Value: Problem-Solving
Engineering is, at its core, problem-solving. It’s not just about knowing the latest JavaScript framework or the newest cloud service. It’s about understanding the problem, evaluating the available tools, and applying them effectively. With the sheer number of tools and technologies available today, the ability to sift through the noise and choose the right one is what separates the good engineers from the great ones.
Versatility: The True 10x Skill
Forget the &#8220;10x software engineer&#8221; nonsense. The real 10x skill is versatility—being able to move between different technologies and domains with ease. It’s about having a deep understanding of core principles and applying them across various scenarios. And here’s the kicker: you don’t need to know every tool. You just need to know enough to make informed decisions and solve problems efficiently.
Let’s get specific:
1. Frontend Technologies: React vs. Svelte
React is the go-to for most developers, but Svelte might be the better choice for projects where performance and simplicity are key. My recommendation? Stick with React if you’re building something that requires a robust ecosystem and community support. But don’t sleep on Svelte if you need something lightweight and performant.
2. Backend Development: Node.js vs. .NET Core
Node.js is great for asynchronous, real-time applications, while .NET Core shines in enterprise environments with heavy computational tasks. If you’re working on a web API that needs to scale quickly, Node.js is a solid choice. But if you’re dealing with enterprise-level data processing, .NET Core might be the better fit. My recommendation? Use Node.js for quick, scalable web services and .NET Core when you need to integrate deeply with Microsoft ecosystems. And PLEASE use TypeScript.
3. DevOps and Cloud Computing: AWS vs. Azure
Both AWS and Azure offer a wide range of services, but they excel in different areas. AWS is known for its breadth and maturity, making it a great choice for startups and companies looking for a wide range of tools. Azure, on the other hand, integrates seamlessly with Microsoft products, making it ideal for enterprises. My recommendation? Choose AWS if you’re building something from scratch and need a variety of tools. Opt for Azure if you’re in a Microsoft-centric environment.
4. Security: OAuth2 vs. JWT
OAuth2 is powerful for complex, multi-user environments, while JWT is great for simple, stateless authentication. If you’re building a multi-tenant SaaS platform, OAuth2 is the way to go. For simpler applications with a need for secure, stateless authentication, JWT gets the job done. My recommendation? Use OAuth2 for complex, enterprise-grade applications and JWT for leaner, straightforward authentication needs.
5. User Experience (UX): Figma vs. Adobe XD
Figma is excellent for collaborative, web-based design work, while Adobe XD offers powerful offline capabilities and tight integration with other Adobe tools. My recommendation? Go with Figma for real-time collaboration and XD if you’re already embedded in the Adobe ecosystem.
The Real 10x Factor: Confidence and Decision-Making
Let’s be clear: The idea of a 10x software engineer is a myth. It’s not about output—it’s about making smart decisions. The best engineers aren’t just cranking out code; they’re making strategic choices that drive the project forward. And the most critical of these choices? Making solid recommendations.
Here’s one truth: Making a recommendation is one of the most valuable things you can do as an engineer. When you suggest a solution, you’re not just offering an opinion—you’re providing a roadmap. If you can make strong, well-informed recommendations and back them up with confidence, you become indispensable. You’re not just an engineer; you’re a strategist.
Here’s a harder truth: The people who call the shots often don’t know what they’re talking about. They’re not the ones deep in the code, dealing with the complexities of the tech stack or understanding the nuances of what needs to be done. It’s important to communicate clearly when what they’re asking for might require more time or resources to do right. A good boss will appreciate your expertise and trust your judgment. If they don’t, it might be worth considering whether you’re in the right environment.
Example Situations
Example 1: Framework Selection for a High-Performance Web App
You’re tasked with building a high-performance web application. The client wants something snappy and efficient. Do you default to Node.js/React because it’s popular and Joe Blow at work said we should use it all the time? Do you recommend Svelte because you believe it’s more performant in this use case? Here’s my take: If performance is the #1 priority, we need to think beyond JavaScript metaframe-works and focus on the architecture. First and foremost, we need server-side rendering, and there’s hardly a more performant stack than C# ASP.NET Core with all of its caching capabilities and optimized memory management. If you’re using C# and opting into cloud hosting, you’re looking at Elastic Beanstalk or AWS App Services. Client-side, we want something that is lightweight to reduce bloat. If you can, go with vanilla JavaScript (with TypeScript for development, of course). At each step, the priority is reduction, caching, and minimizing client-server interactions.
Example 2: Scaling a Data-Intensive Application
You’re dealing with a backend that’s starting to creak under heavy data loads. Do you recommend scaling out with more servers, or do you take the time to refactor and optimize the existing code? My recommendation: This depends on the budget. Scaling out is definitely a quicker fix, especially if you’re hosting in Azure or AWS, but it could burn a hole in your pocket if you’re not careful. Optimizing data caching is the fix, as opposed to a band aid solution like scaling out.
Example 3: Balancing Security and Usability
You’re building an authentication system for a consumer-facing app. Do you go all-in on multi-factor authentication (MFA) for maximum security, or do you recommend a simpler, frictionless OAuth2 flow that won’t scare away users? My recommendation: Consider your user base. For a consumer app, prioritize a smooth user experience by implementing a simple OAuth2 flow, with MFA as an optional feature for those who want extra security. This approach minimizes friction, making it easy for users to sign in while still offering additional protection when needed. In contrast, for enterprise apps handling sensitive data, mandatory MFA is essential despite adding complexity, as the higher stakes require robust security measures to protect against unauthorized access.
The Power of Suggestion: Walking Gold
Here’s the thing, if you can make strong, well-informed recommendations, you’re worth your weight in gold. The best engineers don’t just code—they guide. They look at the bigger picture, make strategic choices, and confidently steer projects in the right direction. That’s the real 10x skill: not writing ten times more code, but making ten times more impactful decisions.
When you’re making those decisions, you need to be ready to answer some key questions that will determine the success of any project. Here are a few you should have answers to if you want to be a formidable opponent in the tech space:
1. What tech stack do I use?
Are you going with the tried and true, or is this a time to experiment with something new? What are the project’s priorities: speed, budget maintenance, reliability, security, or something in between?
2. Where do I host my site?
AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem, or somewhere else entirely? What’s the cost, and what’s the support like?
3. How much is it going to cost?
Break down the problem into smaller parts. Identify the risks involved for the task at hand. For example:
Being able to answer these questions confidently—and making sure the people who call the shots understand the implications—sets you apart as an engineer who’s not just competent but invaluable.
Final Thoughts
The true power of a software engineer lies not in the quantity of their output but in the quality of their decisions. Specialize in solving complex problems, have a passion for what you do, and learn from your losses—those “L’s” are what make you better. Be versatile, be confident, use failure as a learning opportunity, and most importantly, be someone who makes strong, informed recommendations. That’s how you become invaluable in an industry where change is the only constant. You’re not just an engineer—you’re a problem solver, a guide, and a rockstar.

From .bak to .bacpac: Managing Azure Migrations with Non-Standard Backups
When it comes to cloud migrations, not every scenario plays by the book. Our recent migration of a Kentico project to Azure was supposed to be straightforward—until we were handed a .bak file instead of the expected .bacpac. This blog post unpacks the unique challenges we faced and provides a detailed walkthrough of our solution.
Note: You might wonder why we didn’t simply restore the database directly on our Azure server using SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio). It’s important to understand that Azure SQL Server does not support restoring from a .bak file directly. Instead, Azure requires the use of .bacpac files for database imports. This distinction is crucial for planning migrations and requires alternative strategies when traditional backups are not feasible.
Determining SQL Server Version from Backup Files Without Restoration
Before diving into the complexities of migration, it’s crucial to understand the environment we&#8217;re dealing with. One of the first hurdles we encountered involved identifying the SQL Server version of the .bak file provided, as mismatched versions between the source and target can complicate restorations.Typically, this information isn&#8217;t accessible without restoring the database, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, there&#8217;s a more efficient approach: using a SQL query to extract this information directly from the .bak file. By running the following SQL command, we can peek into the .bak file to retrieve essential details about the SQL Server environment without the need for a full restore:
Replace &#8216;C:\PathToYourBackup\YourBackupFile.bak&#8217; with the actual path to your .bak file. This query provides a snapshot of the database&#8217;s metadata, including the version, which is instrumental in planning a smooth migration.
Restoring the Database from a .bak File
Once you have determined the SQL Server version of your .bak file, you may encounter scenarios where it is incompatible with all your available SQL Server versions. If this happens, consider the following options:
If your .bak file is compatible with your target SQL Server version, the next step is to restore the database. This process can seem daunting, but with the right commands and a careful approach, it can be executed smoothly. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you restore your database from a .bak file:
This process will transfer the data from the .bak file back into a live SQL Server environment, effectively recreating the original database structure and contents on your target server.
Handling Large Tables with BCP for Efficient Data Management
Due to the substantial size of certain tables within our database, a direct export to a .bacpac file was not feasible, as it would routinely cause timeouts. To circumvent this issue, we opted to individually extract these large tables using the Bulk Copy Program (bcp). This method allows us to offload the data efficiently and handle it separately, which is crucial for managing the database size during migration.
Important: Before proceeding with the BCP process, ensure that any foreign key constraints related to these large tables have been properly handled. Refer to the &#8220;Handling Foreign Key Constraints During Large Table Exports&#8221; section further in this article for detailed instructions on how to drop and reapply these constraints to avoid complications during the migration process.
For example, to export a large table, you can use the following bcp command in an administrative command shell:
Note: if Windows authentication isn&#8217;t an option for connecting to SQL Server, use:
Replace dbo.YourTableName with the name of your large table, &lt;YourFilePath&gt;\&lt;FileName&gt;.dat with the path where you want to store the exported data, YourDatabaseName with the name of your database, and YourSQLServerInstance with your SQL Server instance name. By executing this command, the specified table’s data is exported into a .dat file, effectively reducing the load and complexity involved in the main database export process. This technique not only simplifies the handling of large datasets but also ensures that all parts of the database are backed up with integrity and are ready for a smooth transition.
Handling Foreign Key Constraints During Large Table Exports
When dealing with large tables that have foreign key constraints, there’s an additional step to consider. Since foreign keys enforce relationships between tables, they can complicate the export process, especially when using bcp or excluding these tables from the .bacpac file. Here’s how to manage this:
In our case, we were fortunate that our large tables didn’t have any foreign key constraints, simplifying the process. However, this may not be the case for others, so it’s important to prepare for this scenario.
Excluding Large Tables During .bacpac Export
After handling the large tables with the bcp command, the next step in our migration process involves exporting the remainder of the database into a .bacpac file. This file format is ideal for Azure migrations but requires a careful approach when dealing with oversized data. Here’s how to efficiently exclude the large tables during the export:
By strategically excluding large tables during the .bacpac export, we ensure the file remains manageable and tailored for Azure migration. This approach minimizes potential timeouts and errors associated with large database sizes, streamlining the migration process to Azure.
Setting Up Your Azure SQL Database and Integrating Large Tables
Once the .bacpac file has been successfully exported without the oversized tables, the next phase involves setting up your Azure SQL Database and integrating the large tables you managed separately. This two-step process ensures that all components of your original database are accurately recreated in the Azure environment. Here’s how to complete this integration effectively:
Deploy the .bacpac to Azure SQL Server
To deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:
Integrate Large Tables
To deploy your .bacpac file to Azure, follow these steps, which include creating a new SQL database directly from the .bacpac file:
By carefully setting up the Azure SQL Database and methodically integrating the large tables, you can ensure a complete and functional migration that mirrors your original database environment. This meticulous approach not only secures data integrity but also enhances the overall performance and scalability of your database in the cloud.
Final Thoughts: Streamlining Site Migrations to Azure
In conclusion, migrating a project to Azure involves more than just transferring data; it requires strategic planning and careful execution, especially when dealing with large databases. By employing methods such as using bcp for large tables and efficiently managing .bacpac imports, we can overcome the limitations posed by traditional migration methods. The steps outlined in this guide not only simplify the process but also ensure that every component of the database is accurately recreated in the Azure environment, maintaining integrity and performance. As cloud technologies continue to evolve, so too do our approaches to optimizing these migrations, enabling businesses to leverage the full potential of cloud computing.

Using Page Builder With Custom Routing in Xperience by Kentico
Recently, I was working on a project that I needed to implement status code pages that had page builder enabled on them. Since these were status code pages, I needed custom routing and could not use Content Tree routing provided by Xperience by Kentico. Once I enabled page builder for this content type and added editable areas to the view, I quickly realized I was missing something.
When I ran the project and hit my newly created status code pages, I received the following error:
The Problem
When using custom routing, Xperience does not have context into which content tree page is connected to the custom route URL. Therefore, it cannot provide the page builder widgets associated with the page you are trying to reach.
To provide a little insight into the data behind the scenes: each web page item has a widget field where the page builder configuration is stored in. This can be found in the CMS_ContentItemCommonData database table, in the ContentItemCommonDataPageBuilderWidgets and ContentItemCommonDataPageTemplateConfiguration columns.
If Xperience doesn’t know which web page is associated with the request, then it cannot render the corresponding widgets.
The Solution
With the information from above in mind, we can infer that we need two things. We need to retrieve the web page item associated with the request, and the page context, or in other words, the data associated with that page (page builder widgets).
We will use the ContentItemQueryBuilder and GetWebPageResult to retrieve the web page item. In order to grab the correct web page item, we need to limit the results by the WebPageItemId. We can do this by getting the page context using the IWebPageDataContextRetriever. The code below shows how we can build the query to retrieve the page.
We are limiting the result to only the web page item whose WebPageItemID matches the page context WebPageItemID.
The final step in retrieving the web page item is the execution of the query using GetWebPageResult. If you want to read more about Xperience’s Content item API and retrieving pages, you can reference their documentation here.
Finally, we need to pass the context of the web page item to Xperience. This can be accomplished by using the IWebPageDataContextInitializer interface, which provides an Initialize method that takes a RoutedWebPage item as an argument. We can construct the RoutedWebPage object from the page data that we retrieved.
Final Thoughts
To wrap it up, integrating page builder with custom routing in Xperience may require some extra steps, but the process is straightforward once you understand the underlying mechanics. By manually retrieving the page data and initializing the context, you can get your custom-routed pages working seamlessly with the page builder. This approach not only resolves the context issue but also keeps your custom-routed pages flexible and fully integrated with Xperience’s powerful content management features.

Xperience by Kentico Content Querying Updates
With the release of Xperience by Kentico, the platform has experienced significant transformations aimed at enhancing flexibility and performance. This version introduces a range of new features and improvements, marking a clear shift from previous iterations. An aspect of these changes is the updates to the API, which now adopts a modular and service-oriented architecture. These updates are designed to provide developers with more efficient and powerful tools for managing content and integrating with third-party systems. The new API structure emphasizes flexibility, allowing for more precise queries and streamlined data operations, which improves developer experience and application performance.
Removal of TreeNode
The first notable change to Xperience by Kentico’s API from previous iterations is the removal of the concept of a TreeNode. Previously, TreeNode was central to representing and managing the hierarchical structure of pages within the CMS, allowing developers to manipulate page data directly through a tree-like structure. The removal of this concept marks a significant shift in how content hierarchies are handled within the platform. The tree structure, while powerful, imposed certain limitations on scalability and performance, particularly as websites grew in complexity and size. By moving away from a tree-based model, Kentico aims to provide a more flexible and modular approach to content management that can better support modern web development needs.
In place of TreeNode, Xperience by Kentico now utilizes new APIs that separate content retrieval into two sets of objects: one for querying web page-specific content from a given channel called IWebPageFieldsSource and one for querying re-usable content from the new Content Hub called IContentItemFieldsSource. These interfaces make it easier and more efficient to retrieve and manage content.
Content Item Querying Overview
The ContentItemQueryBuilder class is at the core of this new querying system. It allows developers to build detailed queries tailored to specific content types and retrieval needs. Paired with the IContentQueryExecutor, the API supports complex filtering, sorting, and data manipulation, making it easier to develop dynamic, content-rich applications. This new API structure enhances the developer experience by improving the ability to handle complex content scenarios with ease.Shown below is a depiction of the overall structure of a content item query.
Content Item Querying Examples
Below are some examples of the new content item querying in action. We will walk through how to build and execute your queries efficiently, and some different query options you have at your disposal.
Building your Query
To start, you can build a simple query that retrieves all items of a specific content type. This is useful when you need to fetch a complete list of content items for display or processing.
Then, you can apply subquery configuration and global parameters like sorting to the content items being queried.
If you need to filter content items based on tags within a specific taxonomy, this approach allows you to target content items that are associated with certain tags, making it easier to manage and display tagged content.
Executing and Mapping Query Results
After your query is built, it is time to execute the query. This is where IContentItemQueryExecutor comes in. Assuming that the IContentItemQueryExecutor is injected like so:
When querying content items, you can execute the query and map the results to a model to handle the retrieved data efficiently. Here are two approaches using the IContentItemQueryExecutor.
1. Using GetMappedResult Method
This method maps the query results directly to a specified model:
2. Using GetResult Method with a Model Binder
Alternatively, you can pass in a custom model binder to handle the mapping. This provides flexibility if you need custom mapping logic or additional processing during the binding.
When you need to retrieve both web page-related data and content item-related data, the Xperience by Kentico API provides methods to execute these queries and map the results to your models. This is useful for scenarios where you want to handle data that includes both the content of a web page and additional metadata or settings associated with it.
1. Using GetMappedWebPageResult Method:
The GetMappedWebPageResult&lt;TModel&gt; method is used to execute a query and map the results to a specified model type. It is similar to the GetMappedResult&lt;TModel&gt; function but also allows access to web page-related database columns.
2. Using GetWebPageResult Method with a Model Binder:
Alternatively, the GetWebPageResult method allows you to pass in a custom model binder. This provides flexibility for custom mapping logic, enabling you to process and transform the retrieved data as needed.
By using these methods, you can efficiently execute queries and handle the results, whether you&#8217;re working with content item data, web page data, or both. The choice between using GetMappedResult/GetMappedWebPageResult and their counterparts with a model binder depends on your need for standard or custom mapping logic.
Final Thoughts
The updates to Xperience by Kentico represent a significant evolution in how developers can query and structure content within the platform. The shift from the traditional TreeNode structure to a more modular and flexible architecture, combined with the new querying capabilities, makes Xperience by Kentico a capable solution for modern web development needs.

The Power of Effective Communication in Project Management
“Genius is the ability to put into effect what is on your mind.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald
Project management and communications are inseparably linked.
In the world of project management, success is often determined by the effectiveness of communication. Picture this: you&#8217;re leading a team on a complex project, juggling deadlines and client expectations. Suddenly, a critical team member is unsure about their role, and a key stakeholder feels out of the loop. The entire project starts to unravel. What could have prevented this chaos? The answer is clear communication.
In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore how effective communication can significantly impact project management and share some real-world examples and practical tips for enhancing communication within your team.
The Importance of Communication in Project Management
Aligning Goals and Expectations
Imagine you&#8217;re building a house. The architect, builders, electricians, and plumbers must work together seamlessly. If the architect envisions a modern masterpiece while the builder thinks rustic cottage, the result will be a disaster. In project management, clear communication ensures that everyone involved is aligned with the project’s goals and expectations.
Enhancing Team Collaboration
Effective communication fosters a collaborative environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas and feedback.
Managing Risks and Changes
Projects always face unexpected challenges and changes. Consider the previous example of building a house, and imagine the project runs into geological issues. A project cannot be built successfully on a poor foundation (in this example, quite literally). If the project manager encouraged open communication, it would allow the team to quickly identify the problem and develop a new plan. This example illustrates the importance of communication in managing risks and changes.
Improving Stakeholder Engagement
Effective communication is not just about internal team dynamics; it also involves engaging with stakeholders.
Tips for Enhancing Communication in Project Management
Use the Right Tools
I wouldn’t mow my lawn with a pair of scissors, and I wouldn’t cut my toast with a chainsaw. There always needs to be intentionality when choosing the right tool for the job. Similarly, utilizing the right communication tools can make or break a project. For instance, a remote team working across different time zones might rely on Slack for instant messaging, Zoom for video calls, and Asana for task management. Choosing the right tools for your team’s needs ensures seamless communication.
Encourage Open Dialogue
Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns. Encourage open dialogue by actively listening and valuing input from all team members. During a change management project I was involved with, a simple suggestion box led to a wealth of new ideas and improvements, proving that sometimes the quietest voices have the most impactful contributions.
Schedule Regular Meetings
Regular meetings help keep the team aligned and provide an opportunity to address any issues or questions. However, be mindful not to over-schedule meetings. Jeff Bezos famously adopted the &#8220;two pizza rule&#8221;: never have a meeting where two pizzas wouldn’t feed the group. Ensure each meeting has a clear purpose and agenda to avoid unnecessary gatherings.
Be Clear and Concise
When communicating, aim to be as clear and concise as possible. Avoid jargon and complex language that may confuse team members or stakeholders. This is particularly important within the technology industry, where audience comprehension of complex concepts may be wildly varied, even within expert teams. This can also help avoid making assumptions.
Provide Feedback
Constructive feedback is an essential component of effective communication. Provide regular feedback to team members, acknowledging their strengths and offering guidance on areas for improvement. This also means sharing and celebrating wins publicly, particularly on projects that operate within sprints, to keep up the team morale and momentum.
Final Thoughts
Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful project management. By prioritizing clear and open communication, project managers can align goals, foster collaboration, manage risks, and engage stakeholders more effectively.

Communication Roles: Changing Your Approach to Fit the Situation
Effective communication is the backbone of successful project management. Nothing can build or break confidence more than the way we communicate, both with our clients and with our teams. Understanding and mastering various communication roles and knowing when to use which strategy, can enhance team collaboration and impact overall confidence. Here, we explore five key communication roles: the Expert, the Owner, the Guide, the Consultant, and the Facilitator.
The Expert
The Expert role is crucial for moving projects forward with informed decisions. In this role, you provide your professional opinion backed by solid reasoning.
For example, if asked, &#8220;Why would you choose to build this website using NextJS?&#8221; a succinct response might be:&#8220;We chose NextJS for its ability to provide server-side rendering, which improves page load times and enhances SEO. Additionally, its ease of integration with various APIs and extensive community support makes it a reliable choice for our web development needs.&#8221;As an Expert, your goal is to present well-founded, singular opinions that help drive the project in the right direction.
The Owner
The Owner role is about providing clear, analytical updates without delving into storytelling. This style is particularly effective for status reports. Here&#8217;s how to structure your communication as an Owner:
State your objective: &#8220;Our objective is to complete the client&#8217;s website redesign.&#8221;
Provide the current state: &#8220;We are currently on track to finish on time and have 70% of the designs completed.&#8221;
Name the next steps or timetable: &#8220;The next milestone is the final design approval, which is scheduled for next Friday.&#8221;By focusing on these elements, you ensure that your communication is concise and informative, keeping everyone aligned on progress and next steps. This is a no-fluff approach. Leave the “why” out of it.
The Guide
The Guide role involves setting context and telling stories to provide clarity and direction. This is especially useful when dealing with complex or ambiguous tasks. For instance:
State the situation: &#8220;We need to estimate these user stories before the sprint kickoff on Friday.&#8221;
State the complication: &#8220;There are still some unknowns on several user stories.&#8221;
Resolution: &#8220;Can the Business Analyst please work with the dev team and possibly the client to resolve these unknowns so we can complete the estimation?&#8221;
By framing the situation this way, you help your team understand the broader context and the importance of resolving specific issues, thereby guiding them toward effective solutions. Where the Owner role avoids the use of “Why”, the guide uses “Why” or context to help explain the difficulties and nuance of a tough situation.
Ideally, this is used outside of stand-ups, which are intended to be short and concise.
The Consultant
The Consultant role is about empowering others to take action, making it ideal for client interactions. When presenting options, avoid solving the problem outright. For example:State the situation: &#8220;Our sprint kickoff is at the end of the week, and we need to share our total estimate with the client.&#8221;State the complication: &#8220;The estimated effort is higher than we estimated during the sales process.&#8221;
Provide options
Option 1: &#8220;We can look for a less complicated solution.&#8221;
Option 2: &#8220;We could consider cutting out some less important features.&#8221;
Option 3: &#8220;We could look for additional budget if everything is needed and no changes are possible.&#8221;
If asked, you can then provide your recommended resolution. This approach empowers clients and team members to weigh their options and make informed decisions. It leverages the expertise of all parties but gives room for personal opinions and overall collaboration.
The Facilitator
The Facilitator role is essential for gaining buy-in from the wider team, especially when dealing with less appealing tasks. Consider this scenario:Situation: &#8220;We need to maintain legacy services for several of our clients.&#8221;Complication: &#8220;These services run on an old server that we need to decommission, but moving them requires updating those existing services.&#8221;Ask a question: &#8220;How do you think we should handle this situation?&#8221;By posing a question, you invite input and collaboration, which can be particularly effective in overcoming resistance and ensuring team commitment to necessary but less exciting tasks. This is also helpful when your role is identifying issues, but you personally lack the expertise on how to resolve the problem. It is similar to the consultative approach but is more hands-off in providing a solution.
Conclusion
Mastering these five communication roles—Expert, Owner, Guide, Consultant, and Facilitator—can greatly enhance the effectiveness of your communication within the scope of a project. Each role serves a specific purpose and, when used appropriately, can lead to better project outcomes, stronger team collaboration, and more satisfied stakeholders. Try some of these strategies out the next time you find yourself in a situation that requires a nuanced approach to communication.

Generating Realistic Test Files for Secure and Comprehensive Application Testing
In software development, generating test files is essential for various scenarios, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Creating realistic test data that mimics production data allows developers to thoroughly test and debug their applications in a controlled environment while ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.
I have been working on the YouthCenter application by BizStream for a while. YouthCenter is a comprehensive juvenile case management system used by organizations such as juvenile probation, courts, and detention centers. Recently, I needed to implement a feature to facilitate file migration within the application. Using live production data was not an option due to the risk of exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or other sensitive data protected under regulations like HIPAA. Instead, I generated a variety of documents, including Word files, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, and images. This approach allowed me to test the application effectively without compromising real data, providing a reliable testing ground that closely resembled real-world usage.
One of the main advantages of using generated test files is the ability to create realistic data sets that closely mimic real-world scenarios without exposing sensitive information. This ensures comprehensive testing of various application functionalities, such as file processing, uploads, and migrations, under conditions that reflect actual usage. It helps identify and fix potential issues that may only surface with large and varied data sets. Moreover, generating diverse file types and structures ensures that the application can handle different data formats and edge cases effectively. This method also supports performance testing by simulating high data loads, helping optimize the application’s performance and scalability. Ultimately, it enhances the reliability and robustness of the application, ensuring it performs well in production environments.
For the example below, the file generator will generate as many files as the user needs. File names and the content of the files are all generated. My personal preference is Bacon Ipsum, but the generation call can be modified to call any Ipsum service you would like.
Code Structure and Organization
To effectively generate various types of files for testing purposes, our code is organized into several key components:
This modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.
1. Base File Generator Class
The base class, FileGenerator, provides common functionality for all file generators, such as generating random text and images. It also defines an abstract method Generate that each specific file generator must implement. This file requires the RestSharp package to make HTTP requests and Bogus for generating random data.
The FileGenerator class is an abstract base class that provides methods for generating random text and images. It includes an abstract method, Generate, that each derived class must implement. The GetBaconIpsumTextAsync method fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API using RestSharp, while the GetRandomImage method generates a random image with specified dimensions. The GetRandomFileName method uses the Bogus library to generate random file names.
File Path: Generators/FileGenerator.cs
Required Packages
This modular structure enhances maintainability and scalability, allowing for easy addition of new file types or modification of existing ones. Below are the details and explanations of each code file.
2. Word Document Generator
The DocxGenerator class is responsible for generating Word documents. It uses the DocX library to create and manipulate Word documents. The class inherits from FileGenerator and implements the Generate method, which creates a new Word document, inserts random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API, and saves the document to the specified path.File Path: Generators/DocxGenerator.cs
Required Packages
3. Excel Spreadsheet Generator
The XlsxGenerator class handles generating Excel spreadsheets using the ClosedXML library. It follows the same pattern as the DocxGenerator class, fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API and populating the Excel sheet with random words. The class ensures that the generated file is saved correctly to the specified path.
File Path: Generators/XlsxGenerator.cs
Required Packages
4. CSV File Generator
The CsvGenerator class generates CSV files by fetching random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, splitting it into words, and organizing it into a grid format. This class ensures the generated CSV files contain varied and realistic data, making them suitable for testing. I did not do any handling for commas in the Ipsum data returned, so data in the CSV files could potentially be misaligned. This was acceptable for my testing purposes, but can be handled within this generator if needed.
File Path: Generators/CsvGenerator.cs
Required Packages
5. Text File Generator
The TxtGenerator class creates plain text files filled with random text fetched from the Bacon Ipsum API. This class ensures the generated text files are populated with realistic content, aiding in comprehensive testing.
File Path: Generators/TxtGenerator.cs
Required Packages
6. PDF File Generator
The PdfGenerator class handles generating PDF files using the PdfSharp library. It fetches random text from the Bacon Ipsum API, breaks it into lines that fit within the page width, and adds new pages as needed to accommodate the text. This class ensures that the generated PDFs are filled with realistic, multi-page content.
File Path: Generators/PdfGenerator.cs
Required Packages
7. Folder Path Generator
The FolderPathGenerator class is responsible for generating random folder paths and ensuring they exist. This utility class helps manage the organization of generated files by creating new directories and keeping track of existing ones. This class ensures that each file generated can be placed in a randomly chosen folder, either new or pre-existing.
File Path: Utilities/FolderPathGenerator.cs
Required Packages
8. Image File Generator
The ImageGenerator class is responsible for generating image files. It uses the .NET System.Drawing library to create images with random colors. This generator is useful for creating test image files that can be used to simulate image uploads and processing in applications. The images generated by this code may not be anything stunning (solid canvas in a random RGB color), but the files have proper formatting to be able to be opened in an image viewing application.File Path: Generators/ImageGenerator.cs
Required Packages
9. Main Program
The main program of the application serves as the entry point and coordinates the entire file generation process. It begins by setting the root path for file generation to the user&#8217;s desktop and prompts the user for the number of files to generate. The program then initializes an array of file generators, each capable of creating a specific type of file, such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images.
In a loop that runs for the specified number of files, the program randomly decides whether to create a new folder or use an existing one for each file. It selects a random file generator from the array and generates a file with a random name and appropriate extension in the chosen directory. The program ensures asynchronous operations complete before proceeding, providing an efficient and organized way to generate a diverse set of test files. This setup simulates real-world file handling scenarios, enhancing the robustness and comprehensiveness of application testing.File Path: Program.cs
Required Packages
Final Thoughts
Creating an application to generate various types of test files (such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, text files, PDF files, and images) ensures that developers can produce realistic and diverse data sets without using sensitive production data. This process is particularly useful for testing features like file processing, uploads, and migrations, allowing for comprehensive testing while maintaining data privacy and security. The application is organized into key components: a base file generator class, specific file generators for each file type, and utility classes. The main program coordinates the file generation process by prompting the user for the number of files to generate and leveraging these file generators to create content. By dynamically deciding whether to create new directories or use existing ones, the program effectively simulates real-world file organization. This setup enhances testing reliability, helping developers identify and fix potential issues, ultimately improving the application&#8217;s robustness and performance in production environments.
