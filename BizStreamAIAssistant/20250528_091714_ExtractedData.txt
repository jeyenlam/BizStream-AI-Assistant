Page 17:Web Accessibility
Build a Website That’s Accessible for Everyone
Increase Engagement with All You Offer.
You know that web accessibility is important.
BizStream Can Help
Whether you’re starting a new site or redesigning your existing site, our comprehensive Web Accessibility Solution helps you deliver a positive experience to all visitors who interact with your organization.
In partnership with Recite Me—a leading global Enterprise SaaS accessibility solution provider—we’ll help you ensure your modern website reaches your entire audience.
What Does Web Accessibility Really Mean?
According to Census data, 27% of people in the U.S. have a disability that can make accessing online information difficult. For most organizations, that number alone makes improving web accessibility an imperative. A truly inclusive website provides an integrated approach that goes beyond basic and expected adaptations.
people in the U.S. live with a disability (CDC)
of U.S. residents are neurodiverse (CSR Wire)
Americans speak a language other than English at home (AMACAD)
Inclusive web development helps overcome barriers to access including:
Visual
Visual disabilities, including low vision, blindness, color blindness, or light sensitivity
Cognitive
Cognitive disabilities, which include a range of challenges including learning disabilities, neurodiversity, and behavioral and mental health disorders
Communication
Communication barriers, including language and cultural differences
Auditory
Auditory disabilities, including full or partial hearing loss and difficulty understanding sounds when there is background noise
Physical
Physical disabilities, such as muscular, sensory, joint, and pain disorders that limit movement and the ability to use devices
Speech
Speech disabilities, which make it difficult to use video chat, teleconferencing, or voice recognition technologies
Accessibility Isn't a Checkbox
For us, compliance standards are a baseline. But being inclusive means being in true partnership with your customers. It comes from a place of combined empathy and pragmatism. It’s being always open to the needs of others so you can deliver your solutions to everyone who wants them.

Start now and enable continuous improvement with these essential elements for compliance and improvement.
Craft Your Accessibility Statement
Demonstrate Commitment to Inclusivity
Just as you include a Privacy Policy on your site, you should also include an Accessibility Statement. This simple document explains in plain language:
Explore free tools to generate your own Accessibility Statement.
Add An Accessibility Toolbar
Enable individuals to adapt your website to their needs.
An accessibility toolbar is an embedded widget that provides an array of controls so that site visitors can customize aspects of your site and launch adaptive tools. Some examples of adaptive controls include:
Set Up a Governance Solution
Follow through on your accessibility commitment.
Your accessibility practice is an ongoing process. Accessibility Checker software should give you a structure for active governance, including:
Build In Inclusivity
Accessibility presents unique challenges at multiple levels of your website modernization process.
Work with a partner who will guide you through the details every step of the way.

Our Website Accelerator for Storyblok solution code has been checked, validated, and optimized to provide an accessibility-ready framework that enables best practices for your content and workflows.

Clients Using Siteimprove
I use the [Siteimprove for Kentico] Policy module to find the pages on our website containing contact information for employees who are no longer employed to delete these contact details. Our Danish website consists of approximately 4,500 pages, and our English website of approximately 700 pages. Because we have 850 employees in total, many employees leave every month. Without the Policy module, it would mean a lot of work to find every instance manually.

Page 33:Our History
“BizStream” Launched
Well, technically, Schmidt Technologies was launched. BizStream was initially launched under Schmidt Technologies Incorporated from two computers on one folding table in another tech firm&#8217;s space, and even some days at an apartment in Grand Rapids, MI.
We Got Our First Big Break
Many may not realize our journey began in the realm of portals. It all started when our first large client, one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of audience seating, came to us with a need to manage all their internal information and communications. So, we built them a custom intranet-based portal to do just that! Over the years, our core focus has grown to provide easy solutions for complex problems enterprise companies face, but portals will always hold a special place in our hearts.
We Launched Under the Name BizStream
As&nbsp;we moved away from contract work and started landing more complex projects, our company started to change. To better reflect our work, we expanded our team and rebranded from Schmidt Technologies Incorporated into what is now known as BizStream!&nbsp;
Our First eCommerce Site Was Born
In 2005, NoWaterBall hit the market in full swing! While these novelty golf balls didn&#8217;t actually clear water, sand, or annoying trees with their super-advanced technology, as suggested, they did provide us with a fun avenue to make our first eCommerce site! NoWaterBall may not have panned out to be the multi-million dollar company we unrealistically hoped for. Still, we had fun, gained a ton of experience, made a few bucks, and have had enough golf balls to last 17 years and counting …
Visit the NoWaterBall site
We Moved Into Our First Office
To accommodate our growing team, BizStream rented our first office at Engine House No. 9 in Grand Rapids, MI. We frequently visit the old building while enjoying a pint, as the building is now home to The Mitten Brewing Company!
First GeekAid Music Festival Happened
The GeekAid Music Festival was a one-day music event co-founded by BizStream’s founder, Mark Schmidt. It aimed to grow the West Michigan technology scene by raising scholarship money for Grand Rapids Public Schools graduates entering the art and technology fields. The events featured bands, silent art auctions, beer tents, and food trucks!
BizStream Moved
In 2008, BizStream made another office move! This time we headed West of Grand Rapids, MI, to a town called Allendale. The new office had so much room for activities like a Foosball area, a gym, and even our very first conference room!
Our First Product Made Its Debut
Remember back in 2003 when we built an intranet for a client? Well, we took the foundation of that project, did A LOT of customization, and launched it as a product called YouthCenter. Thirteen years later, YouthCenter is one of the top Juvenile Case Management Software solutions for Juvenile Probation, Diversion, and Detention Centers. Today 33 counties across 6 states use YouthCenter.
BizStream Became a Kentico Gold Partner
In 2010, BizStream officially became a Kentico Gold Partner! BizStream has completed yearly partner surveys, passed bi-yearly Partner Quality, and staffed Kentico-certified developers and marketers to maintain our status as a Kentico Gold Partner. Being a Kentico Gold Partner allows us to deliver projects to our clients faster as this badge of honor gives us access to many resources and training not otherwise shared. In 2020, we celebrated ten years as a Kentico Gold Partner!
Foosball Got Geeky
BizStream solidified its immense love for foosball by buying its very own professional foosball table! The fun doesn’t end there because when you give a bunch of geeks a foosball table, they’ll eventually put their techie twist on it. Built during BizStream Lab Days, our team used AI to make the games more fun with an internal foosball application. Rigged up to the foosball table is a computer and interface that auto selects teams, predicts the winners, makes game announcements, and even throws in crowd sentiment! Unsurprisingly, this is the favorite tour stop among our visiting student groups.
BizStream University [Academy] Started
This program was born out of a desire to get the younger generation interested in coding. Our first BizStream University session started in May 2012 with only eight students and one mentor. Shortly after, in November of that year, our first student was hired to work at BizStream! Between then and now, we changed our name to BizStream Academy and refreshed our logo a few times. Since launch, we have taught over 250 students how to build web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
BizStream Bought a Building
In 2013, BizStream bought a 20,000 square-foot warehouse-like building. After a complete renovation, the new office furnished multiple conference rooms, a unique developer’s loft with a firefighter’s pole, a sales and administrative area, a full kitchen, and more!
Mark Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2014, our founder Mark Schmidt was selected from over 170 nominees for Grand Rapids Business Journal&#8217;s 40 Under Forty list! Mark was selected based on his work with BizStream Academy, GeekAid, and BizStream&#8217;s unique company structure.
Read the 40 Under Forty &#8211; 2014 &#8211; Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
BizStream Won Kentico Xperience Global Site of the Year
Our implementation of the BDO USA, LLP site was shortlisted by Kentico executives and voted on by Kentico users beating out thousands of entries submitted by Kentico’s 1,000+ global partners!
Over seven years later, BDO is still one of our largest clients!
BizStream Won Michigan 50 Companies to Watch
In 2016, BizStream received the Michigan 50 Companies to Watch award, sponsored by&nbsp;Michigan Celebrates Small Business!
The theme for the year was &#8216;Inspiring Progress and Prosperity: Michigan Entrepreneurs&#8217; and judges examined companies on their innovation within their fields and growth.
BizStream Became a Kontent.ai Partner
BizStream was one of the first companies in the world to get a deep dive into Kentico&#8217;s Headless CMS solution, Kontent.ai! In 2017, we were recognized as a Kontent.ai&nbsp;Premium Partner, the highest partnership level attainable, for our extensive knowledge and work within the platform!
BizStream Named National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For
In 2018, we were recognized as a National Best and Brightest Companies to Work For® winner! We&#8217;ve been recognized for the award ever since, making us honorees for five consecutive years!
Brian Was Recognized as a 40 Under Forty Business Leader
In 2019, it was Brian&#8217;s time to shine as a Grand Rapids Business Journal 40 Under Forty business leader! McKiever was recognized for his influential impact on the local and global tech communities.
Read the 40 Under 40 &#8211; Business Leaders &#8211; 2019 &#8211; Grand Rapids Business Journal Issue
BizStream Expanded Our Office Space
With the help of our trusty contractors, BizStream constructed a 6,200-square-foot expansion! The expansion adds extra bathrooms, a four-season room, a slide, accommodations for up to 50 people, and more.
In 2020 our long-anticipated move-in date had finally arrived! We were promptly met with a pandemic lockdown soon after, but we are now finally back in full swing, thoroughly enjoying the space!
BizStream Went Solar
In 2021, BizStream had 224 solar modules installed on our roof! These panels allow us to offset 95% of traditional electrical usage and produce roughly 88,977kW annually! We even installed an Electric Vehicle Charging Station for our team members!
New Look and New Services
Now that we&#8217;re officially 21, we&#8217;ve decided to exchange our fake IDs for a creative license. We&#8217;ve come a long way over the years &#8211; from exclusively building portals, fearlessly diving into complex websites, building a few products of our own, to now offering in-house design services &#8211; whew! The culmination of this growth resulted in the need for a brand that better represents who we are, what we do, and why we do it.
It&#8217;s been a wild but fantastic 21 years! From the bottom of our hearts, thank you to everyone who helped us along the way! Cheers to many more years to come!
BizStream Receives Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni Award
In 2023, BizStream was recognized as one of the awardees for the Michigan 50 Distinguished Alumni—Great Place to Work Award, presented by Michigan Celebrates Small Business. Our founders were honored on stage at the prestigious in-person awards ceremony held during the 19th annual Michigan Celebrates Small Business Gala!
BizStream Expands Strategic and Digital Capabilities with Acquisition
In 2024, BizStream acquired Refactored, a leading digital agency, marking an exciting new chapter in our growth. The partnership expanded our strategic capabilities with advanced marketing strategies, unmatched expertise in the Storyblok Headless CMS, and a custom Web Accelerator solution built to simplify technology adoption, reduce costs, and minimize project risks. The acquisition leveled up our ability to deliver innovative, scalable solutions—laying the groundwork for even more impactful results for our clients.

Core Values
For a more in-depth look at the meaning behind our core values check out our BizStream Is a Great Place to Work but It’s Not for Everyone blog post.
Atmosphere
BizStream’s office embodies our fun and unique culture. In our workspace, you’ll find a fire pole, slide, Foosball table, dartboard, arcade games, upbeat music, full kitchen, stocked mini-fridges, and coffee for days!
Education & Growth
We believe in celebrating wins and sharing knowledge. Each quarter, our team gathers for What We Crushed (WWC), where we highlight unique victories from client, internal, and community projects. Following WWC, we dive into Ology, a fun, themed experience centered around specific foods or drinks. From Cerealology to Fryology and Mixology, Ology offers a chance to connect, socialize, and creatively celebrate our shared achievements!
We also provide weekly catered Lunch n’ Learns, creating the perfect opportunity for team members to share knowledge and grow together. These sessions feature presentations on best practices, emerging trends, and innovative techniques. Occasionally, we bring in guest speakers to provide fresh perspectives and expertise, fostering continuous learning and inspiration within our team.
Flexible Work Schedule
BizStream offers Tuesdays and Thursdays as optional work-from-home days. We also offer flex-time, where you have flexibility in choosing your work hours. As long as you meet your weekly hours requirement, make sure our clients are taken care of, and get your work done, it’s all good.
The Tech
We want our team members to be efficient and comfortable as possible, that’s why we supply our development team with no less than 3 monitors and their preferred technology &#8211; is there a specific mouse or keyboard you favor? Prefer a laptop over a desktop? No worries, we’ve got you covered. BizStream also covers our team member’s phone plan.
Healthy Lifestyle
Let’s face it, developing isn’t the most active profession out there, but that’s a minor setback in our eyes. Work is important &#8211; but so is our team members’ health.
We provide CrossFit memberships, gym stipends, on-site showers, climbing wall, adjustable workstations, ergonomically correct Steelcase chairs, and daily group walkabouts outside the office when the weather is nice. We also offer fresh fruit and healthy snacks and beverages on the daily!
Lifestyle Benefits
There’s enough to worry about in life, so we encourage our team members to buy in bulk and let someone else prepare their taxes for them.
Team members enjoy a complimentary yearly Costco membership and free tax preparation from our trusted accountant.
Traditional Benefits
We all want to know that if anything bad were to happen, our loved ones would be well looked after, that’s why we offer a $250,000 life insurance policy. We pay for 100% of our team’s monthly health and dental premium and contribute to their HSA. Team members are also offered a match on 401K.
Paid Time Off
Enjoy twelve paid holidays and up to 20 paid days of personal time.
We’ll occasionally step away from the office and kick back and relax with our team members. March Madness parties, BizStream golf outings, and company picnics are just a few ways we like to rejuvenate. Explore more of our fun side on our Facebook page.
